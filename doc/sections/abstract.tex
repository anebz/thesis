\section*{Abstract}

An \emph{abstract} is a brief summary of a research article, thesis, review, 
conference proceeding or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject or 
discipline, and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper's 
purpose. When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript, 
acting as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper or patent application. 
Abstracting and indexing services for various academic disciplines are aimed at 
compiling a body of literature for that particular subject.
