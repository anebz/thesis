We do not believe that we should c her ry - p ick
But this is not what happ ens
Of course , if a d ru g add ict bec om es a p us her , then it is right and necessary that he should pay and answer before the law also
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by thank ing Mr B ur t one for his report
' L eg al d ru g s ' ( tr an qu ill i z ers ) find ing their way on to an i l leg al market , especially when used in comb in ation with al c o h ol , are a major and serious problem particularly for y oun g people
I should like to take this opportunity to express my than ks to Mr T it le y
It was a very difficult position and I therefore am de light ed about the new agreement
We must accept that , in the real m of b lo od and pl as m a colle ction , the system s v ary and oper ate on m i x ed bas es
The Min utes of yesterday ' s sitting have been dist rib ut ed
To this end the O ost la nder report takes substan ti al note of the European Commission guidelines which are very clear , very precise and do not le ave ro om for sub jec tive inter p ret ation
Europe should not get over amb iti ous by tr ying to manage public health policy
In any event , the N ational Fr on t demand s that the pe op les of Europe should be direct ly consult ed in a refer end um to dec ide on the appro val or re jec tion of M a ast r ich t II
The auth ors of the report consider that enlargement to the e ast is u nd ou b ted ly possible in the ory , but will be far more difficult in practice
I would ask you , Members of the European Parliament present here , to support this amendment by Mrs St en i us - K au k on en which all members of the Fin n ish parliament ac ross party b ound ar ies support
They are s il ting up
France was the first to take di p l om atic and human it ar ian action
I con st ant ly bring this matter up both in w ri ting to the President and to the he ad s of the political groups
Question No 7 by Mar í a I z qu i er d o R o j o ( H - 0 2 5 2 / 9 6 )
It is a question of how decisions are taken , that is to say whether this is done on the basis of a vote or of cons ens us , and whether un an im ity is required or some form of qu al if ied majority
N ep al is very high up and help ing this country where needs are very great must also be high up on our list
This commitment to negotiations between the social partners could initi ally be reached on four matters , which seem to me essential , as of now . N e goti ations must begin
The Committee on Transport and T our ism has adopted four amendments for the second read ing
They will certainly en h ance the feel ing of the right of movement by EU citizens and they will also certainly benefit dis abled d ri vers
The initi al Commission proposal was adopted un am end ed by Parliament on first read ing
Europe in particular has to remain a lead ing play er if it is to saf eg uard its international competi tiveness , not only in terms of economic perf orm ance but also in the exp lo it ation and w id es p read application of new for ms of techn olog y
The abs ence of harmon i zed rules govern ing int el lect ual proper ty is not un i q ue to Europe
We are gi ving a clear political sign al to the M or oc c an authorities to continue al ong the road towards li beral i z ation , political as well as economic
B oth demand a cre di ble and active policy to redu ce C O 2 em ission s through a comb in ation of inc en tive , regulation and prog res sive tax ation
This is something which the committee as a whole f el t strong ly about in the resolution on the ann ual economic report and it is a significant o m ission that it is not in the resolution to w ind up this debate
It is like the st ory of P l at o and the ca ve ; it is the sign if i er , not the sign if ied
The Committee on Transport would therefore have been well adv ised to dev ote rather more attention to that committee ' s proposals , which were adopted with the strong back ing of the P P E Group and the support of the social ist Members
In t en years , our dep end ence on fish import s has increased by 3 0 % ; and the process ing industry dep end s al most entire ly on import ed fish
I hope we can look at and address proper ly the issue of qu ot a ho pp ers
The Commission he ed ed this call
S ub ject : T ender ing proced ures for mo b ile ph one l ic ences
This means that ter re st ri al f re qu en ci es may face new competition in a form over which European s no longer have any inf lu ence
What I am saying is that we agree with the House on the need for action
Thank you very much , Mr B ang em ann
This s ort of un g ent le man ly con du ct is not accept able
It does not s ol ve the employment problem if the most we can do is offer f ir ms new pro fit mar gin s , which provid es no guarantee of employment , and also dam ag es the environment and social security
It is all very well to have common min imum rules on the employment of ch ild r en , but my w if e and I do not need an EU directive to dec ide whether our s on should deli ver new sp ap ers
So it is also necessary to establish very quickly whether the international pres ence in B os n ia , so fundamental to any recon struction effort , is to continue
I am gr ate ful to the President -in - O ffice for his answer . How ever , I am s or ry to have to say that the results of the D i R o ber t o m ission fall short of our expect ations
Therefore there is a need for a European directive
The procedure follow ed : comp l ain ts dec la red ad m is sible and pri m a fa ci e found ed are communic ated to the institution or bod y in question , which is asked to give a first opinion
The work of the European O mb ud s man and the Pe ti tions Committee is comp lement ary
The ann ual activ ity report clearly states how the O mb ud s man ' s offic e work s and what citizens should do if they want to take matters to the O mb ud s man for consideration
H er support ers know that by g ather ing together they are def ying the rul ing j un t a
The m il it ary authorities are still play ing too great a part in the social and political life of that n ation
The report clearly def ines which be ver ag es may be b ot t led in sp ark ling w ine b ot t les
B ec ause c r é m ant , which has ac qu ire d its p at ent of no bility here , is not an issue just for one region but for the European Union , too
S ince we to ok the initiative of t abl ing the or al question there has been some progress
But our first concern is to pres erve fish st oc ks , and especially her ring st oc ks
The Commission , for its part , will continue to play an active part in the inter governmental con ference
Let me say to Mrs G re en and the other Members that it is not true that the con ciliation agreement with the European Parliament on the inf ra st ruct ure projects was un il ater ally chang ed at F l or ence
A not her problem the M ol itor Group does not su ffic i ently deal with is implementation
The same difficult y appli es , m ut a tis m ut and is as far as the European Parliament is concerned
The resolution sub mitted by our Committee on W omen ' s Right s des er ves the support of the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council
My answer - and I hope Parliament ' s too - will be a directive aim ed at introdu cing a stat ut ory right to interest for f ir ms pa id un w ar r ant ably l ate
It is an espe cial problem for our 1 7 million small and medium -si zed enter p ris es
It is local authorities and large organ i z ation , qu ang os and national governments which are by and large responsible for a very high prop or tion of that
Madam President , the European Council in F l or ence g ave the imp ression of en orm ous conf u sion where the problems of employment are concerned
I to ok it over at the begin ning of this Parliament , a lot of the work on it having already been done by a colleag ue of m ine , C la ud e D el c ro i x
Rep resent atives of all sect ors of industry have indic ated , at a public hear ing , that they see h uge problems with the Commission proposals
First ly , in draw ing up any new proposal , the Council and the Commission must take account of the views of the trade un ion s
A re there any other comments ?
We therefore wish to see clear word ing here as well
N ever thel ess , the re jec tion of cons u mp tive em b ry o research - and on this point we are ag reed - requ i res cons ist ency
No such decision has as yet been taken
The sch e me was to be set up this a ut um n and the aid pa id direct to women ' s net wor ks by the Commission
I therefore congratulate the European Parliament for having organ i zed this debate , and would end by thank ing you for inv iting the Commission to take part in it
How can one remain independent or cla im to be comb ating cor ru p tion if , at the same time , one is in rece ip t of l ar g es se , obvious ly with str ings att ach ed ?
C itiz ens have a better gr as p of their rights and oblig ations
And the D ub lin European Council will recon f irm 1 J an u ary , 1999 as the begin ning of the Th ird St age of E M U
In my view that re in for ces the argu ment that one should not believe that E M U will a ut om atic ally mean jobs
The first one is in relation to the H el ms - B ur t on legislation and our relations with the United States
If you look at Parliament ' s di ary for 1997 , you will find that 8 and 15 S ep t ember are actually S und ay s and week - ending day s , not week -b eg in ning day s
M e i er recommend ation for second read ing
R ec ently a German Council official to ld me that his Brus sels offic e might as well be in B on n , as his main point of reference was the German F ore ign Min ist ry
We refer to this in paragraph 4 of our resolution , the four th ind ent , where we specifically state that the current approach is based on wish ful think ing
A major part of this work will be ens uring greater economic policy coordin ation between all 15 Member States
This would c ut down a great deal on ab du ctions
T ra dition ally , responsibility for decisions on c ust od y has res ted with national authorities
Of course there is a differ ence
At the same time , I cannot appro ve of terr or ist act s in any form
The vol u me of produ ction in the sh eep me at sector is only 1 0 to 15 % of that in the be ef and v e al sector
This is the whole point !
The necessary cor re ction will be made
Madam President , our main concern through this report and through this vote was , once more , to make it clear to the Commission that we will not accept further c ut s in sp ending on development
But yesterday ' s p ap ers said that He ine k en had not in fact p ull ed out
The rep at ri ation oper ations are progress ing sm o oth ly
Israel also points the way in the produ ction of e du c ational so ft w are
At the same time , it contrib utes to a redu ction in the amount of be ef produ ced
I th us look forward e ag er ly to the Commission ' s communication and I should like to start this debate a f res h with a number of questions
I know that it is not e as y , or something that can be achie ved by tomorrow mor ning . S pe aking for myself , I simply want us to be able to con du ct our deli ber ations on a more re li able basis
The Commission has not even g ot as far as sub mit ting a proposal
We do not need a central offic e for the whole of Europe which c entr ally comp il es all the off ences that have to be enter ed in the rec ord of p en al ty points !
But I would like to know what per c ent age of all c ust om s official s in those countries are tra ined to oper ate this kind of system
How is it possible for the Commission to extend the trans it system to other e ast ern countries before a system in co ll ap se has been completely reform ed in order to c ur b fraud ?
We believe that the resources should be increased in line with the problems and needs of our country and that measures must be put in place to spe ed up the abs or p tion of funding and to monitor its use
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 no on
Fin ally , paragraph 9 3 states that the extre me right - w ing par ties adv oc ate xenophob ia
As k ing for asylum is not a crime , and should not be treat ed as such
( rapporteur : Mr van d er W a al )
There is a need for continu ity in decisions of the kind we have already taken here in the House on te le c omm un ic ations inf ra st ruct ure
We need detail ed , conc re te proposals
Un fortun ately , at this stage the run ning is being made by Am er ic an companies and we are much s low er in c at ch ing up on development of this so ft w are
Con sequ ently , as my report say s , this is what we must do
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
The IGC must amend the Treaty so that it includ es the fundamental right of equ ality between the se x es , but yet more is needed
S ome are un n ecess ary because they are already cover ed while others are not accept able because they would mean chang ing existing law
We must face up to the fact that we are talking about a red ist rib ution of inc ome and face what that invol ves
The ban ning of over ti me will de pri ve b l ue -c o ll ar work ers of addition al ear ning s , and they will not be able to make end s meet with their basic pay al one
In the case of these substan ces , applic ations are made for the Community to f i x m ax imum res id ue limit s , as provided for in Council Reg ul ation 2 3 7 7 / 9 0
I hope it will sp read a round here
At present , all r ad i o ac tive w ast e on the p en in s ul a is k ep t in medium -term st or age fa cili ties either on l and or on bo ard ship s
I would , therefore , like to conclud e by saying that the Commission is being asked to do things , and to mention five things that we are doing or that we will do
On the other hand , know ledge , inst ant communic ations and mo bility will be the ch ar ac ter istic s of the tw ent y -f irst -c ent ur y economy
They do not understand why Europe ex ists in the ory but not in reality
The fact of the matter is that in this cent ur y , 1 9 0 million people have been k ill ed in w ar s , 6 0 million of those in Europe
The debate on the state of the European Union is cl osed
But that unfortun ately has become a tra dition !
te le c omm un ic ations services ' where as we are in fact talking about the link ing of the fa cili ties of organ i z ations provid ing te le com services , which is the word ing of the o ri gin al ver sion and which we would pre fer
I consider the establish ment of a European mark that indic ates conf orm ity with European standards as an appropriate to ol of quality policy that can contrib ute to impro ving our competi tive position
A re the control s able to be ex erc ised proper ly and to what extent are they actually effective ?
That is something our citizens can understand
So , congratul ations to the organ i z ers and to the European Community m ission
This may have been than ks to the sen sible approach of the lead ing par ties or to the abs ence of the other e th n ic group , but it was certainly also than ks to the pres ence of I - F O R
They were deli ber ately process ed so s low ly by the S er b s that many of them were un able to vote
A . E ven in a high ly li beral i zed market , work s of ar t constit ute an excep tion
S ure ly not
We believe there is no way that al c o h ol cons u mp tion can be des c rib ed as ' bene fic ial in mod er ation '
We have some of the fin est d air y and be ef her d s but we also know every thing about B S E , which has h it us more than other areas
Madam President , I will make my contribution as brief as possible to make it e a si er for us to deal with the entire agenda
Madam President , sure ly we must take things serious ly !
I shall therefore now also give the f lo or to Mr De ll ' Al b a once again on a point of order
The common position does indeed incorpor ate many of the amendments proposed by Parliament at first read ing
I think that I e ch o the whole House in wish ing you , on behalf of all our colleagues , all the very best for your political care er in your home country , Austria . You have our w arm est wishes
Let us think back to the te le vision without f ron ti ers directive , Parliament ' s first read ing of which was completely i gn ore d , because the Commission pre fer red to take the Council ' s s ide
For example , we were to maintain an open and transpar ent dialogue which would be ac ces sible to the man in the st re et , an agreement which was def ined in greater detail in the dec l ar ation of 2 5 O ct o ber 199 3
At the start of 199 6 , there were 2 1 3 9 2
There is no h es it ation in talking about ' res er ves which are cont r ary to the principles of budget ary or th od o x y '
The next item is Question T ime to the Commission ( B 4 - 0 9 7 1 / 9 6 )
It high light s in particular the adv ant ag es offer ed by short - se a sh i pp ing in the B al tic as a means of access to S c and in av ia and to the C I S
Wh il st I support every thing that my colleag ue , M s M or gan has said , it is a w ider issue than that
If research has been carried out by several people or institutions in various different countries , it could be al most imp os sible to ob tain cons ent
The second point rel ates to a su it able budget ary alloc ation , as opp osed to that proposed by the Council , which is tot ally in ade qu ate and unacceptable
With its proposal , the Commission is well on the way to under min ing the whole point of the E number system
But I must also remind you that I have received six mo tions for resolution s to close this debate
The W or ld P over ty su m mit in C op en h ag en last year set us all the amb iti ous aim of e li min ating absolute po ver ty world - w ide
I doubt whether the countries in question will vote for the proposal at the Intergovernmental Conference
The D anish social dem ocrat s have voted in favour of the proposal to amend the list of ext ra ction s ol vent s , since the change does not affect the level of protection in D en mark
We call on it for a b ur st of c oura ge
I had asked about the development of the single European market , in which three of the four freedom s are a dang er , in my belie f , to ch ild r en
We must therefore ensure that we con du ct a policy in Member States which makes y oun g people and others say no to n ar c o tic s
It concerns the appro x im ation not just of type appro val but also of technical t est s and int e gra ting them on a European basis
This initiative appe ar s tot ally in o pport un e in a context of budget a ust er ity
It is true that to accept the challenge would have had the effect of end ang er ing the inter in s titutional agreement and st ar ting a budget disp ute
C ulture is being ex ter min ated
If there is no conc lu sive decision from the government , c ere al produ ction will det eri or ate further in 1997 and 1998
Mr President , I agree with the previous speak er ; unfortun ately it is e as y to see in the case of B el ar us what the leg ac y of the So v i et Union still means today
W ould it not be more correct , leg ally spe aking , to place the measures under the third p ill ar and act at an inter governmental level ?
I therefore call again on the Commission to start and close negotiations in good time in future so that the proper consult ation procedure can be conclud ed and a legal b ase adopted before pay ments are made
The industry was ex pe c ting that
This is a h y p oc ri tical budget he ad ing , given the environmental damage that we cause in our own countries
It may be that medi a interest in A I D S in the develop ing countries has dec l ined , but in any event it is not a major subject of public debate at the moment
I think that that is the very great m er it of Mrs M c N ally ' s position and I must therefore congratulate her on her report
In a n ut s he ll , we believe it is right to be concerned about this issue , but this is the wr ong legislation
We shall seek to promote greater cohesion between the regions v ia improve ment of the trans fer of know - h ow on aspect s of energy -s a ving strategy from regions with a develop ed energy efficiency d y n am ic to regions which are significant ly behind in that respect
I now come to the statement of ass ur ance
I am happ y to inform you today that I was able to present a first report to E c o f in yesterday
B oth of these consider ations have to be taken into account in our decision concerning the legal imp o sition of comp ul s ory qu ot as of European produ ctions in te le vision broad c ast s
It is currently a matter of regret to us that the Ha ut al a report has not provided the opportunity for real coordin ation of Community policies on competition , industri al policy , trade and the internal market
It appe ar s from cont act s with the Commission that this is a problem in cross-border tra ffic in other Member States , too
This is a view we do not in any way share
Let me start by rest ating our deter mination that the European Union should play its part in this process , as indeed it is already doing through substan ti al economic and financial aid
A min imum with excep tions is not a min imum
But perhaps the Commission could also answer the question , or else it could do something very simp le
I hope , therefore , that there will be some further attention to proced ures so that we can be account able
Parliament has adopted amendments which def ine nuclear techn olog y as un s ustain able , and here we all need to cl ar if y what we mean with regard to sustain ability and the nuclear issue
It is v ital for both farm ers and the industry for the Commission to introdu ce a specific support system for non- f o od c ro p s and to that end I call for a s ep ar ate system of support for these c ro p s
The joint debate is cl osed
In order to makes fish eri es relations clear er and simp ler , in 199 5 the Commission received a m and ate to negoti ate new framework agreements with the B al tic rep ublic s to rep la ce all existing fish eri es agreements
It is c al cul ated that no d ut y is currently pa id on 8 0 % of import ed f low ers
I never thel ess , as a real ist , ac know ledge that it is a fact
I also want ed to say that a few min utes ag o Parliament received a pe ti tion sign ed by the l ar g est number of people ever
This plan will , of course , be ad ap ted according to new develop ments in the region but the basic ass u mp tions will , how ever , remain rele vant
One aspect will be that we ensure proper t ri als for those gu il ty of g en o ci de
A Council W or k ing Group has been exam ining the two proposals and on 1 1 No ve mber E c o f in not ed that substan ti al progress had been made , particularly on the Article 2 3 5 proposal
E ven today , the g ap between the high est and low est de fic it s among the EU States has become significant ly n ar ro wer , and that tr end must continue
And fin ally , the most dra m atic tra ged y of all is that the market is global but the single currency will only be European
Fin ally , Commissioner , and my conclud ing rem ark s are address ed particularly to you , obvious ly we would not want this own -in iti ative report to be just one more document on your t able
The criteria v ary and the Member States consider that they are carried out by certain official services al one
This ass er tion seems incor rect
Li ving out an example is the most effective m eth od of pre vention
U nder the gu ise of harmon i z ation , you will d est ro y social security
I should now like to refer to a second , completely different issue
It would cost Ö S 7 0 2 b illion for the C C E E to comp ly with the EU water directive al one
Thank you , Commissioner
At the same time , I am dis app oint ed that n one of the leg ally b ind ing agreements which have been made within the framework of inter st ate cooperation have yet come into force
The negotiations for an agreement on trade and cooperation between the European Union and S ou th A f ric a are between those countries and not between the European Union and s ou ther n A f ric a
Do es this mean that , at the D ub lin S um mit , the U K will be the only Member State not to have p il ot action programmes for the L oc al and Regional T er r itor ial P act s for E mployment ?
Madam President , Commission ers , ladies and gentlemen , this is the second read ing of the elect ric ity directive , which is design ed to create an internal market in elect ric ity
We will be supp or ting only these amendments , not the others , because we want the single elect ric ity market to begin oper ation as soon as possible
A cc ord ing to the case law of the European Court of Justice , a directive which has been adopted but not transp osed is an ad equ ate legal basis for cla im s by third par ties
C om p l ain ts have already been made , in France , Mr C ot , as you know
Mr President , I t ried to re ver t to the min utes before you mo ved on
We are not opp osed to this provided that the word defin i tive is not inter p re ted as ' standard ised '
H uman rights throughout the world in 199 5- 199 6
B ec ause only in that way will it be possible to bring an end to the b r ut al and ab h or r ent exp lo it ation of the y oun g
We are call ing for all these fact s to be taken into consideration and for the case to be re - e x am ined
So I read that new sp aper , and I think there are many new sp ap ers that would not have the confidence to att ack their government the way G lo b us does
We have no comp l ain ts about you , quite the opp os ite , you have sh own c oura ge and in si ght in recent months
Of course international inter vention was an absolute must , an oblig ation , and we did not do what was necessary
It is necessary , therefore , to provide a specific policy for the we t land s , based on their g e o graph ical areas
In principle , we ag reed with Mrs L ind ep erg ' s motion for a resolution and its critic ism of the in ade qu a ci es in the area of the third p ill ar
I am a hold er of what is call ed the or ange b ad ge in the United K ing d om , and that will be affect ed by any changes that would be made as a result of this recommend ation coming into being
A pp ro val of the Min utes
I must say it was unfortun ate that she ch ose my report about which to make it
If we accept that work makes an essential contribution to people ' s pro s per ity and well b e ing , the same certainly hold s good for dis abled people too
I have said it before and I say it again , we know who was po is on ing the whole of Europe
In this case the comp ens ation ex ceed s the share of the budget alloc ated to S p ain , res ul ting in a redu ction in the comp ens ation pay ments for all S p anish produ c ers in the 1997 h ar ves t
Do not for get , ladies and gentlemen , do not for get that the ess ence of a democracy is not that what the majority say s , goes
I believe this m ess age must be he ed ed
I would also ask you to bear in mind the fact that no objec tions were made concerning this vote when the Min utes were sub mitted for appro val on the following day
Madam President , I also wish to express my best wishes to the D ut ch presid ency
In short , we need to ensure that the information soci ety off ers equal opportunities and m ut ual benefit s to all
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a . m
We could , of course , have sh own greater c oura ge for co - d et er mination and not for redu ced participation , precisely because we were not under press ure of time
I urge that we keep national tra ditions but at the same time adv ance democracy in the world of work at the European level
The Commission want ed to include the budget ary provision s in the proposals
Mr President , first I want to express my app re ci ation of the fin e resolution in this ann ual debate on r ac ism and xenophob ia
First of all , the fact that we should not and cannot deal with or look upon terr or ist act s as something requ ir ing excep tion al proced ures or legislation
The R ed ing report is therefore both time ly and important
It is a m ist ake to ass u me that effec tiveness is the same as sup r an ational ity
At least we are making a start with implementing the no ble aim s set out in the En erg y Ch arter
There may be a simp le expl an ation , and this may be due to a little s li p - up or m ist ake in the administration
There is just one more point I should like to make about this whole situation
We believe that this situation must be re vers ed , and that social cohesion has to be our pri me concern
I must inform you that for technical reason s it was not possible to trans l ate , pr int and dist rib ute all of the amendments to this report in all l ang u ag es
For the s ake , of course , of the un b ri d led purs u it of pro fit of mon et ar ism and high fin ance
I shall therefore concentr ate on the part play ed by the Commission in this affair
I should like to end by ad ap ting a tra dition al saying : ' F ri end s of P l at o , but f ri end s of the tr uth even more '
The report recogn i z es the amount of money sp ent on research
N or do we want w it ch - h un ts or s ound b ite s ens ational ism when we are as si g ning b la me
I should like to know how the Commission intend s to should er this responsibility
Reg ard ing inf ring e ments , I just mentioned one case vis - à - v is one Member State
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his compreh ensive rep ly
Question No 6 0 by H u ber t P ir k er ( H - 00 3 6 / 9 7 )
The Commissioner seems at a complete l os s having received the report of the ag ency which the Commission itself comm ission ed
It is a question of how deter min ed we are to regul ate in order to create the mod es of transport we wish to see
I would also like to thank the Committee on B udget s which s ent a let ter with their comments on the report
There the sim il arity between me and Mr B ang em ann prob ably end s
I should just like to ask Commissioner F is ch ler one question : how long is the tr an sition ph ase ?
Wh y did Mr D el ors not come forward to prot ect and def end the Commission ?
takes gu ard against the priv a ti z ation of social ris ks , especially with regard to health '
It requ i res clearly def ined mark ing , and not least it requ i res information as to what the mark ings mean
I hope to have answer ed all the questions
B oth s id es are w ag ing the political st ru gg le rem or sel ess ly and it has been going on for years now
European - le vel regulation of m ort g age cre d it would therefore mean appro x im ating the security and application rules at the same time , h ence u l tim ately the EU - w ide harmon i z ation of national proper ty law provision s
I regret that , but , as you all know , the de ad line of 1 J an u ary next year is put ting press ure on us all
If we require it to bear the addition al b ur den of the social policy , we will be h ound ing more and more jobs out of Europe
We considered whether we should go on w a iting for the Dire ctive , which is imp os sible in view of the d ate and the legal basis we are creating for national regulations , or whether we should accept a comprom ise
It is sen sible to strengthen consum er rights and interests in the area of financial services , ban ks and ins ur ance services for example
This issue is so g ra ve that it is hard to understand how something like this could have happen ed in the European Union
Ch ad
Fin ally , the Commission has also ex er ted press ure to have a cla use ins er ted in the Treaty , at the Intergovernmental Conference , pro h ib iting any form of ra cial discri mination
We should also pay increasing attention - just as the rapporteur proper ly point ed out - to the inter re l ation between short , medium and long term ty p es of aid , through a d u ly co her ent approach
In fact , the O ffic ial J our n al has already p ub lish ed the Commission ' s regulation on the c er ti fic ates that import ers must hand over to the Community ' s c ust om s authorities before f urs can be import ed
That is why we are call ing for guarant ees for our citizens - it is clear that the t ight ening of security must not be used as a pre te xt to restric t their freedom !
A fter all the attention given to the elect ron ic high way , the focus ing of attention on the social aspect s brought a b reat hing sp ace
It is not true , ladies and gentlemen , because there are no ob so le te industri es ; there are ob so le te techn olog ies
We are voting for the report
But of course we can def ine the conditions under which such an industry can oper ate more clearly than in the past
The rapporteur has presented an excellent report
In f orm ation techn olog y is only a support
What is the Commission doing to u ti li z e P h are programme funds more effici ently in the important prepar atory stage ?
Question No 2 2 by Mr G al la gh er ( H - 01 8 1 / 9 7 )
Th ous and s of k il omet res away the fraud ster is able to ho od w ink the system , and this has been happen ing
The work done by the Committee of In qu ir y , which sh ed s so much light on the situation and provid es strong political im pe t us , will be of great help when it comes to trans lating these initiatives into action
I believe we can help the population more effective ly in that way than by mere ly appe ar ing as f ire f igh ter s when ever there is a crisis
Th ose agreements are a sour ce of employment for a very large number of struct ur ally sen si tive maritime regions
I would therefore like to offer my than ks for your co ll ab or ation on this specific aspect
I cannot vote in favour of this resolution because of the paragraph s on re in for ced co - oper ation
I could in fact have c ut you off purs u ant to R ule 4 7 , Mr P ir k er , because you were not spe aking on the subject , but en g ag ing in a discussion of principle
N ow , the matter of women and the problem a tical situation of women in A f gh an ist an
N ow , three points rel ated to this subject : a number of measures have been taken in connection with the specific subject of trade in human being s for the purp os es of se x ual exp lo it ation
1997 is a year of major step s towards nuclear dis arm ament
T od ay , we are dis app oint ed
And yet G M O s are not the p an ace a of agric ult ural development !
Therefore I do not think that a number of you have been completely acc ur ate today when you state that we did not take account of the fact that many Member States were against the recommend ation to appro ve this m a i z e
And it is not very po l ite to inter ru p t a colleag ue while he is spe aking
The no tion of Community financial assistance - that is the Treaty ' s exp ression - does not , indeed , exc lud e g en u ine budget ary inter ven tions
I must stress that for this process to be successful it must be inc lu sive
M ass es and di men sion s of m ot or vehicles
N ext , there is the u nd ers p end of the appropri ations : some 2 0 % for the structural funds and 2 4 % for the European social fund , in particular
I think that the report is excellent and it is good that three individual issues have been raised as t ang ible examp les so that everyone may understand what this is about
It is not e as y in the Commission but you know as well as I do that it will not be e as y in Parliament either
That appli es more particularly today , at a time when a g ra du al increase in t ension s and difficulties is threat ening to s w eep us off course
The Commissioner was correct when he said that the crisis is political
The I r ish presid ency presented a comprom ise text on this at the Council meeting of De ce mber last
That bro ke the partnership , and the result of the bro k en partnership li es before you : a b or ing a ut o -o il con cept that lead s now h ere
E ven so , we do agree with the objectives of F i ore ll a G h il ard ot ti ' s report
This will allow pl ent y of time for your amendments to be fully considered
Li ke wise the view p oint s of the scienti st s can change if they get together with the fish er men and find out that they are not all b ad d ies , int ent on d est ro ying st oc ks
The Commission accept s the following amendments : No 1 as a rec ital and N os
But , in a more general way , these ob st ac les result from the fact that the way of think ing in the sp h ere of ac ad em ic recogn ition still pre v ail s
One of these instru ments is precisely , within the framework of social prot oc ol , social dialogue
N ot at all !
It goes without saying that ch ild p or n o graph y and r ac ist materi al are out ra ge ous . But a cross-border medium like the Intern et requ i res cross-border legislation , st ar ting at the European level
P er haps because it is st ar ved of f ue l , because the Council ref us es to free up enough funds for the various S M E programmes . But that is not the main reason
The committee support s the principle of today ' s working party with regard to future maritime system s and strong ly urg es that this be extend ed to the f if th framework programme as well
We know that d ri ft n et fish ing is unacceptable in the way that the c at ch of d ol ph in s and t ur t les e t c . is not to be recommend ed
That speech may have been wr itt en yesterday , I do not know ; but it seems to me as if we are being treat ed as a r ub ber st amp
The G re en Paper address es only the aspect of un a uth or i zed re cep tion of enc ry p ted services
Our aim should therefore be to ensure that organ ic fe ed s are in fact used exc lu sive ly , with a su it able tr an sition period
It is a sh a me that it has taken so long to appe ar but , as they say , ' better l ate than never '
For example , not enough attention has been pa id to the EU ' s n ort her n di men sion
At the same time , Reg ul ation No 2 0 7 8 of 199 2 on environment ally comp a ti ble agric ult ural produ ction m eth od s ad ap ted to the l and s c a pe has also contrib ut ed substan ti ally to this tr end
It will be possible to w age information soci ety w ar s by means of the net wor ks
I am going to be ask ing you to be very d y n am ic and very cooper ative
These difficulties were all i d enti f ied years ag o but there seems there has been no way of s ol ving them so far
That is r ac ism
Mr President , the two report s which have been discuss ed here this mor ning should set al arm be ll s r ing ing for most European citizens
The tr uth is that our joint actions are un i mp res sive
A not her fact or also has to be b or ne in mind : there have as yet been re lative ly few rul ings under the new procedure
S h ort ly after this meeting , Mr K ab il a ann oun ced that the capital , K in s has a , would be taken by force if President M ob ut u did not res ign within a week
But even the saf est power st ation is man n ed by people
This objective unfortun ately does not ex er t su fficient press ure to give priority to develop ing renew able sour ces of energy
This has to be said quite pl ain ly here
This is high light ed by the on go ing concern in relation to the safety of nuclear inst all ations , including S e ll a f ield , to which many people have refer red during the ear li er debate
I am , therefore , against nuclear power prac tis ed in this way without any n u ance
L ast ly , we are an g er ed by the pro v oc ative st ance of the S ud an ese government vis à vis the repe ated w ar ning s by the international community , and in particular Sec urity Council R es olution 1 0 7 0 of 1 6 A ug ust 199 6
He has already sp ent 2 8 months in pr is on under very un p le as ant conditions , with serious consequ ences for his ph y s ical and m ent al health
Wh ere as s ol ar energy could be a solution in one region it is less vi able in another , where perhaps water power or b i o - energy would be more appropriate
And what do we have here ?
We in the Committee on B udget s consider that this would be imp os sible to implement and would set an unacceptable pre ced ent
Our citizens are demand ing rights
C ertain ly this was a programme which brought great benefit s in its day but these lo ans are less rele vant now than they were
Second ly , the Euro d ac Sy stem is about the possibility of taking f ing er pr int s in the case of asylum - se e k ers and has to do with the implementation of the D ub lin Con vention
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Parliament find s the proposal which is before us today to be very positive , Commissioner
Let me conclud e by ask ing the Commissioner to tell us a little more in his address about other measures he is prepared to propose with the aim of further increasing safety on f er ri es
Mr President , my report also concerns agric ulture , be e - k eep ing to be precise
In fact I des c rib e it to my constit u ents as the comp l ain ts dep art ment of the Parliament
This was so ld when he was not look ing
We need a str ict tim et able , with up d ates standards and the European Union must carry out reg ular chec ks and imp ose s an ctions in cases of vi ol ations
The main concern is unemployment
In tr uth , the single curr en ci es cre ates more problems than it s ol ves and everyone know s that full well
We need to know what are the re ven ue imp lic ations for states
It is non eth el ess important because , in e v it ably , the discussion on mon etary un ion must be suc ceed ed by an in - d ep th discussion on f is c al un ion , which must follow
We dis ag ree tot ally with the rapporteur ' s proposals for a form of ' economic government ' The institution al e di fic e of the EU has no need of new political bod ies or of any strengthen ing of the Commission ' s information - g ather ing po w ers
I am g l ad to hear that the House support s the Commission in those areas
The Commission ' s consideration of the con struction of f re ight free ways does not fully comp ens ate for that o m ission
But it is not a reason for simply sh el ving that procedure
Am I correct in ass um ing they are the st um b ling b l ock in this affair ?
So we want to start in 1997 to give ourselves enough time for a full re vision
I was oblig ed to make this request because I absolutely had to att end the proceed ings of the D ut ch parliament this after n o on and I am particularly oblig ed to you for having ag reed to hold this debate this even ing
As a Parliament , are we or are we not a budget ary authority ?
So the b ig g est inc ome l os s will be b or ne by the market s that have not been reform ed since 199 2 rather than by those , such as c ere als market , that have been reform ed
R et ail ers , too , are call ing for clear guidelines to ensure that they will not need to be as h am ed of their c ust om ers
But I would point out to the Commissioner that there are three read ings under co - d ec ision
Comm er cially spe aking , the Commission is ask ing for the ad ap t ation of the treat y to current real ities
We should res ist any last min ute attemp ts to re ver se that decision
Let us not mis s the opportunity
I found it excellent
M at ter s we regard as particularly important are impro ving the working conditions between the W E U and the EU and the development of a European security system that is not dep end ent on the U S A
P ass ing the h at r ound and tr ying to move things from p ill ar to post is not the mod el way of doing things
I would even say , without i ron y , that the problem is so great that we cannot even assess the si z e exact ly
Ch in a , for its part , has expect ations to live up to
This is very fa ir and indeed this cod e has been wel com ed by the social partners and the Committee on E mployment and Social Affairs
An y thing else would be dis re p ut able . Do you not think so , Commissioner F ly n n ?
First of all , recent communic ations on the information soci ety and the action plan , now in its second ver sion
But non eth el ess that represent s a significant step to improve k ill ing tra pp ing m eth od s , including those currently used in the Community
We can use this programme proper ly to help c oun ter the very power ful for ces that are there u nd ern e ath the sur f ace but will , if un ch ec k ed , lead to r ac ism , f as c ism and national ism
The amendment will therefore be ac cep ted with a s light al ter ation in the word ing
It would also have been v ital to speci f y , second ly , that a fore ign policy is app re ci ated in terms of its effective inf lu ence on the ground
But , fa ced with these problems , the report does not come up with an answer
The report contain s a good analysis of the ' democratic de fic i ency ' in the EU
That is true for min er al oil s , it is true for to b ac c o and it is also true for al c o h ol
We ll , we are already run ning five min utes l ate , but I could still hold a ro ll -c all , as Mr T om lin s on has reques ted
The group of the European Pe ople ' s Party support s this report
Madam President , this is a very technical but important report since we are deal ing with the question of food safety and h y g i ene
In Fin land , more than two third s of sch o ol s are net work ed , where as the cor res pon d ing f ig ure for the Union as a whole is less than 5 %
There are critic is ms to be made , there are many more things we have to achieve and we have to make it clear that these inter governmental con fer ences are perhaps no longer the right m eth od to use
G r ant ed , we are on the wr ong course , but in fact the v es sel is d ri f ting , en g ines st o pp ed
In my own country - Austria , which has only rec ently j o ined the European Union - v ir t ually no one has he ard of the O mb ud s man
That , of course , is un t r ue
We have made that c ry st al -c lear in Article 3
Madam President , Mr R oth le y , you have argu ed very , very e lo qu ently today in favour of employment , and you have u nd ou b ted ly imp ar ted a sense of v ision with regard to this entire issue
L eg is l ation needs to be introdu ced with care , and market s should be established on a re cip ro c al basis
I would like to address my rem ark s to two particular di men sion s of the S A B , first ly on the consum er health policy un it , and second ly on the trans fer of funds for the tra d em ark s ag ency in A lic ant e
E x p eri ence of the ad h oc procedure has been reason ably good to d ate
That is not enough of an economic link , it must be greater than that
How ever , I must conf ess to this House that we are l ate with ins pe ctions in other field s which are of en orm ous importance
What proposals would he make in the context of the IGC in terms of specific policies and measures ?
In my view , how ever , it does not matter what we call the document which c it es the wr ong d o ers and their wr ong d o ings
You have one min ute in all and not for each point of order
I think that that would make sense and I do not know , since I have not yet had the time to read this en orm ous document , whether that is going to be possible
I am express ly gr ate ful to the Commission for taking an ag g res sive approach to this subject
The Commission will also accept Amendment No 7
But I do believe that the Commission communication is a start , and we should tr y to take full adv ant age of all pos sib ili ties within the European Union
He suggest ed that I said that the Court of A ud it ors st o pp ed these contra ct s
I myself recommend ed it to Parliament in the 199 0 report on that strategy
All our rural development projects in the P h ili pp ines are in the po ore st part s of the country , seek ing specifically to help those who are wor st off
Mr M ac art n ey has now been made a min ister for the social dialogue
The Commission therefore decid ed that this should be approved before the end of J u ly
We shall now proceed to the vote
De velop ments on the l ines of those in G e or g ia and Ar men ia are unfortun ately not yet vis ible in T aj i k ist an , which only rec ently be gan to introdu ce economic st ab ili z ation measures
How ever , ladies and gentlemen , we be gan our week here with an exp ression of g ri ef
It takes away our individ u ality and our human ity
' N ine th ous and ban an a produ c ers ?
All this has done no more than create further conf u sion on the matter and has not indic ated a clear r out e for taking a decision at Community level
These things concern all of us
These have come pri m arily from R us si a , often re la b e ll ed as being recyc led product s - R us si a appe ar s to be contra ven ing the Mon t re al Con vention - and from Ch in a where out p ut is actually grow ing
And we have never ac cep ted the ext ra -ter r itor ial principle of the act , which inter fer es with the trade relations of the European Union and its Member States with third countries such as C ub a
L ib el and s la nder would not fall into this c ateg ory either - no ind ict able off ence which is p un ish able by a s ent ence of up to three years
There must be a str ict limit to what Member States can fin ance v ia a un i vers al service m ech an ism
That is the least one can ask if one want s to talk at all about combat ting fraud
In st ead of at last taking the necessary step s , how ever , what does the Amsterdam Treaty do ?
Intern al state authorities can also regul ate this to wh ate ver extent they think necessary
In fact the President ' s O ffice has already inves tig ated this and ag re es with your inter p ret ation
Mr President , I am begin ning to get ir rit ated
I have the b ill from the rest a ur ant which I will give to administration
When will it be real ised that it is high time for the use of reason and most certainly not of we ap ons ?
Madam President , G ener al P in o ch et will c e ase to be Ch ie f H ead of State of Ch ile in Mar ch 1998
This is quite a good idea
This was a matter the Commission had discuss ed within the action plan with C an ad a
G i ven the importance and sen si tiv ity of the subject , our rapporteur has guid ed the committee s k il ful ly throughout this period until we were able to reach a conclusion which we were able to adopt with no v ot es against
That is a pro ven fact and has been discuss ed for years in great detail
All the creat ures of the E ar th lo ve , su ffer , and di e as we do
That must be our pri m ary objective
Therefore , we have to be extremely careful when we analy se them
The information soci ety for um , in which all these people mentioned by Mr The on as work , is quite en th u si as tic about the new pos sib ili ties
Mr President , I app re ci ate your being present in Mad ri d on 12 O ct o ber for our anti - rac ism mat ch , although of course that is not my point
F our th ly , we should harmon i z e our s k ill s training , that is to say we must bring this to the level proposed by the Commission
I think we have said a lot about the 2 0 million une mploy ed , which is good , but we have said nothing about the 5 5 million po or people , many of wh om actually have jobs
N ext year , as budget ary rapporteur , I hope to be able to treat R ap h a el as a true s on , and not as a step s on
I hope that we will , in the field of employment , be w on over by the same press ure for con ver g ence which has been our s for the last few years in the field of economic and mon etary matters
But until that occ urs , I would like to say three things
Question No 3 by P at ric ia M c K en n a ( H - 0 6 8 9 / 9 7 ) :
We support the proposal to set up a s ep ar ate budget item for special measures for the B al tic area
N ow a short comment on the dec l ar ation itself . I completely agree with the cont ents
The S lo v ak President , P ri me Minister and Parliament have public ly undert ak en to rem ed y these de fic i en ci es
Pe ople may also have been serious ly in j ure d
Inde ed , what is important is ar tic le 1 00 A , since the purp ose of this action is effective and un if orm application of the r ule of Community law , which is a condition of the good function ing of the internal market
For that reason we are currently negoti ating par ity agreements with these states on v et er in ary matters and pl ant protection , in the form of supp lement ary agreements to the as soci ation agreements
A ge is important as well , to avoid specul ative trans ac tions sp an ning this inter vention
B es id es that the a ge requirements for t re es are difficult to chec k
I cannot therefore share the view of some of my colleagues who feel they see in the report an att ack on community rights
A fter wards of course , the market will come into its own
When we look at what the U S A and J ap an are doing , then these are fa ir ly mod est demand s
We believe that our amendments contrib ute something use ful
N ow , this standard i z ation cannot be ob tain ed direct ly , because public opinion reject s it
The final ver sion of the draft agenda as dra wn up by the Conference of President s purs u ant to R ule 9 5 of the R ul es of Pro ced ure has been dist rib ut ed
How ever , differ ences of opinion exist ed as to when action should comm en c , above all regarding objective 2000
The press ure of public opinion and the press ure of market s would then have much more effect than the initi ation of any b re ach of contra ct proceed ings by the Commission
But how could he have over lo ok ed you ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen
In practical terms this means def ining s al ient points on the basis of which the living standards of women in the po ore st countries can be impro ved by int e gra ting g ender issues in development cooperation
Th ose who say that the available funds are ins u fficient are right
P er haps rather , it demonstr ates that the treat y does not f ri ght en them
The European Parliament has come out in favour of a t ree as the sy mb ol of a grow ing community and not for three r ig id p ill ar s
The r ise in the number of those working part time is especially mark ed in certain countries , such as the N ether land s and G reat B rit ain , where part time work account s for 2 5 % of the whole
We know from sur ve y s that before 199 3 comp li ance with c ust om s control s was c os ting tra d ers some E C U 7 . 5 b illion every year - that is based on 199 2 trade level s but expressed in today ' s money
Mr President , it is my ple as ure this even ing to welcome this report on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Social ists
D uring its five year d ur ation further use ful experience will be g ain ed , and this is to find con st ant ref le ction in the one year planning
We were un able to support the report in the vote
I believe this is the approach we have to take now in planning this , the gre ates t enlargement - the gre ates t challenge of our hist ory
It o mit s to note that the e uro , if it is brought in , will be a new and power ful fact or of di vision between the Member States of the w ider Europe
It would be help ful if we could support this initiative
E ver y thing they do is basic ally a step in that dire ction
It s need cannot serious ly be question ed
We have also sign ed it and would like that to be rec ord ed ple ase
It is important to provide these countries with a continu ed inc en tive to prep are for a future ad m ission to the European Union
We now hope that through the individual projects we shall g ain experience and know ledge which can also be of benefit to others
Is it possible to get a reason ably satis fact ory answer to this question ?
It goes without saying , of course , that the Commission does not purs ue a nuclear policy , in the sense of tr ying to ob tain as many nuclear contra ct s for industri es in the Member States
For inst ance , the 5 cent co in , at 2 1 . 7 5 m m , is exact ly the same si z e as the 2 0 cent co in , which makes things extremely difficult for people with dis ab ili ties
We have sp ared no effort , in particular by clearly st ating the progress env is aged in the de ep ening of our c ust om s un ion
In any case , I cannot recommend voting in favour of these two amendments
Th en of course there are the well - know n objec tions to this techn olog y , not least in terms of w ast e
S ti ll we f re qu ently see that Am er ic an or other de leg ations hand le their work effici ently and better than our s
A cc ord ing to the Commission ' s draft regulation , only product s with prot e in s chec k ed and analy zed with the current m eth od s of analysis will necess arily be l ab e ll ed as g ene tic ally mod if ied so y a - or m a i z e -b ased product s
I would like to thank Commissioner van de B ro e k and his c ab in et colleagues for their assistance in this " li ber ation '
The d est ru ction of a life is always p ain ful , but this was the life of a democratic represent ative of the people
B ec ause of where I live , I reg ular ly experience the de fic i en ci es of the ra il link between Mad ri d and L is b on , and there are other capital c ities within the Union which could be mentioned as further examp les
It is regret t able that the Commission has exc lud ed the social question , despite the fact that some 5 00 0 00 jobs have already been lo st throughout the European ra il industry
In this way , Parliament will not have access to the recommend ations of the E c o f in Council until the mor ning of 2 M ay
This f eder al Europe of the regions d est ro y s n ation ho od , and is in t un e with the wishes of the support ers of the global economy
I have a very brief question
We are dist ur b ed by the current de ad l ock , which is a matter of v ital concern to the European Union as much as it is to any b od y else
Europe is s ick
L arge differ ences exist , both between c ateg or ies of business es and work ers
S u pport for these areas includ es help for the fish ing industry , la id down initi ally in a regulation of 199 2 , post pon ed in 199 4 and 199 5 and which should have been comple ted by 3 1 st De ce mber 1997
I hope you will understand that , in B os n ia , we are large ly dep end ent on the cooperation of the authorities
I should like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur , Mr S e al , for his account of the e v olution of av i ation li beral i z ation in the European Union
They are low pa id with po or working conditions and their leg iti m ate demand is that they be represent ed prof ession ally with regard to pay and health and safety conditions
That to me seems a back ward step
A cc ord ing to the Commission , the new Objective 2 should only benefit 1 8 % of the Community population
Second ly , as regards the Structural Funds , there is another problem : the Structural Funds Reg ul ation does not allow for pay ments to cover nat ural c at ast ro p hes
It goes without saying that ins pect ors from the Member States can be included in this too
All that will need to change is what happ ens any way with b ank ing institutions : an ext ra currency needs to be add ed to the list of curr en ci es that the b ank ing system deal s with
There has been a debate between Parliament , the Council and the Commission about exact ly where these list s should be sub mitted
The various existing b il ater al agreements on invest ments were to be rep la ced by a mul til ater al agreement based on the principles of most -f av ou red n ation treat ment and national treat ment , which would significant ly li beral i z e invest ment and provide broad ly -b ased protection for it
Do es the Commission accept that seri al comp l ain ts are themselves in j ur ious to the Community interest ?
Madam President , I would like to conf ine my rem ark s to Al z he im er ' s dis e ase
The second issue over which there is concern is the issue of delay
I note that the period since the B ang k ok S um mit has also seen much thought being given to questions of process , coordin ation and v ision
R es u mp tion of the s ession
I dec la re res um ed the s ession of the European Parliament ad j our n ed on F ri day 1 7 De ce mber 1999 , and I would like once again to wish you a happ y new year in the hope that you en j o y ed a ple as ant f es tive period
Al though , as you will have seen , the d read ed ' m ill en n ium b ug ' fail ed to materi al ise , still the people in a number of countries su ffer ed a seri es of nat ural disast ers that t ru ly were d read ful
You have reques ted a debate on this subject in the course of the next few day s, during this part -s ession
In the mean ti me , I should like to obs erve a min ute ' s s il ence, as a number of Members have request ed, on behalf of all the vic ti ms concerned, particularly those of the ter ri ble st orm s, in the various countries of the European Union
P le ase r ise , then , for this min ute ' s s il ence
( T he House r ose and obs er ved a min ute ' s s il ence )
Madam President, on a point of order
You will be aware from the press and te le vision that there have been a number of b om b exp lo sion s and k ill ings in S ri L ank a
One of the people ass ass in ated very rec ently in S ri L ank a was Mr K um ar P on n am bal am , who had vis ited the European Parliament just a few months ag o
W ould it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to wr ite a let ter to the S ri L ank an President express ing Parliament 's regret at his and the other vi ol ent de ath s in S ri L ank a and urg ing her to do every thing she pos sib ly can to seek a peace ful recon ciliation to a very difficult situation ?
Y es, Mr E v an s, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggest ed would be entire ly appropriate
If the House ag re es, I shall do as Mr E v ans has suggest ed
Madam President, on a point of order
I would like your adv ice about R ule 1 4 3 concerning in ad m is sibility
My question rel ates to something that will come up on Th urs day and which I will then ra ise again
The C un h a report on mul ti ann ual guid ance programmes comes before Parliament on Th urs day and contain s a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of qu ot a p en al ties should be introdu ced for countries which fail to meet their fle et redu ction t ar get s ann ually
It say s that this should be done despite the principle of re lative st ability
I believe that the principle of re lative st ability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fish eri es policy and a proposal to sub ver t it would be leg ally in ad m is sible
I want to know whether one can ra ise an objec tion of that kind to what is mere ly a report, not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something I can compe t ently do on Th urs day
That is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , ra ise this question , i.e. on Th urs day prior to the start of the present ation of the report
Madam President, co in cid ing with this year ' s first part -s ession of the European Parliament, a d ate has been set , unfortun ately for next Th urs day , in T e x as in Am er ic a, for the ex ec ution of a y oun g 3 4 year -o ld man who has been s ent en ced to de ath . We shall call him Mr H ic ks
At the request of a French Member , Mr Z im er ay , a pe ti tion has already been present ed, which many people sign ed, including myself
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now con st ant ly follow ed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make represent ations, using the we ight of your pres tig ious offic e and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Go vern or of T e x as , Mr B us h , who has the power to order a st ay of ex ec ution and to rep ri e ve the con d em n ed person
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always up he ld
Thank you, Mr S eg n i , I shall do so g l ad ly
Inde ed, it is quite in keep ing with the posi tions this House has always adopted
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has cons ist ently sh own an interest
It is the case of A le x and er N i k i tin
All of us here are pleased that the cour ts have ac qu itted him and made it clear that in R us si a, too , access to environmental information is a cons titutional right
N ow , however, he is to go before the cour ts once more because the public pro secutor is appe al ing
We know , and we have st ated as much in very many resolution s inde ed, including specifically during the last pl en ary part -s ession of last year , that this is not so le ly a legal case and that it is wr ong for A le x and er N i k i tin to be acc us ed of criminal activ ity and t re as on because of our involve ment as the bene fic i ar ies of his find ings
These find ings form the basis of the European programmes to prot ect the B ar ents S e a, and that is why I would ask you to exam ine a draft let ter set ting out the most important fact s and to make Parliament 's position , as expressed in the resolution s which it has adopt ed, clear as far as R us si a is concerned
Y es, Mrs Sch ro ed ter , I shall be pleased to look into the fact s of this case when I have received your let ter
Madam President, I would first ly like to comp li ment you on the fact that you have k ep t your word and that, during this first part -s ession of the new year , the number of te le vision ch ann els in our offic es has indeed increased consider ably
But , Madam President, my person al request has not been m et
Al though there are now two Fin n ish ch ann els and one Portuguese one , there is still no D ut ch ch ann el , which is what I had reques ted because D ut ch people here like to be able to follow the new s too when we are s ent to this place of ex ile every month
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a D ut ch ch ann el as well
Mrs P lo o i j - v an G or sel , I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Q u a est ors ' meeting on W ed n es day
It will , I hope , be exam ined in a positive light
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not ad h ere to the health and safety legislation that it actually pass es ?
Wh y has no a ir quality t est been done on this particular build ing since we were elect ed ?
Wh y has there been no He alth and S a f ety Committee meeting since 1998 ?
Wh y has there been no f ire d ri ll , either in the Brus sels Parliament build ings or the St r as bour g Parliament build ings ?
Wh y are there no f ire instru ctions ?
Wh y have the st air c as es not been impro ved since my ac cid ent ?
Wh y are no -s m ok ing areas not en for ced ?
It seems absolutely dis gra ce ful that we pass legislation and do not ad h ere to it ourselves
Mrs L y n n e, you are quite right and I shall chec k whether this has actually not been done
I shall also refer the matter to the C ol le ge of Q u a est or s, and I am certain that they will be k een to ensure that we comp ly with the regulations we ourselves vote on
Madam President, Mrs D í e z G on z á le z and I had tabled questions on certain opinion s of the V ice - P resid ent, Mrs de Pal a ci o, which appe ared in a S p anish new sp aper
The compe t ent services have not included them in the agenda on the ground s that they had been answer ed in a previous part -s ession
I would ask that they recon sider , since this is not the case
The questions answer ed previous ly refer red to Mrs de Pal a ci o ' s inter vention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appe ared in the A B C new sp aper on 1 8 No ve mber
Mr B er eng u er F ust er, we shall chec k all this
I ad mit that, at present , the matter seems to be some wh at conf us ed
We shall therefore look into it proper ly to ensure that every thing is as it should be
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear m ess age going out from Parliament this week about our dis con t ent over today 's decision ref us ing to renew the ar ms em b ar go on Ind on es i a, consider ing that the v ast majority in this Parliament have end ors ed the ar ms em b ar go in Ind on es ia in the past ?
T od ay 's decision not to renew the em b ar go is extremely dangerous consider ing the situation there
So Parliament should s end a m ess age , since that is the wish of the v ast majority
It is ir res pon sible of EU Member States to ref use to renew the em b ar go
As people have said, the situation there is extremely vol a ti le
There is, in fact, a risk of a m il it ary c ou p in the future
We do not know what is happen ing
So why should EU ar ms produ c ers pro fit at the exp en se of inn oc ent people ?
In any event , this question is not present ly included among the reques ts for top ical and urg ent debate on Th urs day
Ag enda
The next item is the ver ific ation of the final ver sion of the draft agenda as dra wn up by the Conference of President s at its meeting of 1 3 J an u ary purs u ant to R ule 1 1 0 of the R ul es of Pro ced ure
No amendments have been proposed relating to Mon day and T ues day
R e lating to W ed n es day :
The Group of the Party of European Social ists reques ts that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administ ra tive reform of the Commission
I would like Mr B ar ó n C res p o, who made the request , to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wish es, of course
Th en we shall follow the us ual procedure , hear ing one speak er in favour and one against
Madam President, the present ation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legisl at ure was initi ally a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Social ists which was un an im ous ly approved by the Conference of President s in S ep t ember and which was also exp lic it ly ac cep ted by President Prodi, who re iter ated his commitment in his in au g ural speech
This commitment is important because the Commission is a bod y with a mon op o ly of initiative in accordance with the Trea ties and, therefore, basic ally d ict ates this Parliament' s political and legislative activ ity for the next five years
I would also like to point out , Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legisl at ure . It did so again during this legisl at ure , in J u ly, and then , in S ep t ember , it voted once more to appro ve the whole Commission
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prep are its programme and for us to become fam ili ar with it and explain it to our citizens
To this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 S ep t ember , which recommend ed that the proposal be presented as soon as possible
The event s of last week - which o ri gin ated outside the Conference of President s, that Conference being used simply to cor ro b or ate and ra tif y decisions taken else wh ere - present us with a di le m m a. E ither the Commission is not read y to present this programme, in which case it should cl ar if y it
A cc ord ing to its President, it is in a position to do so
G i ven that the Commission is represent ed by V ice - P resid ent de Pal a ci o, I believe that, before voting , it would help if the Commission could let us know how read y it is to present this programme, as ag re ed. Al tern ative ly, Parliament is not read y to exam ine this programme, as some appe ar to be sugg es ting
In my opinion, this second h y p oth es is would imp ly the fail ure of Parliament in its d ut y as a Parliament, as well as introdu cing an o ri gin al the s is , an un know n m eth od which cons ists of making political groups aware , in w ri ting , of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week ear li er - and not a day ear li er, as had been ag reed - bear ing in mind that the legislative programme will be discuss ed in F e b ru ary , so we could fore go the debate , since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Intern et and Parliament will no longer have to wor ry about it
My Group belie ves that since a parliament is me ant to list en, debate and ref lect , there can be no jus ti fication what so ever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is read y to do so , we still have time to re - est ablish the o ri gin al agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a man ner which fulf il s our d ut y to our fe llow citizens
Therefore , the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Social ist s, and which you have mention ed, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on W ed n es day , including its proposed administ ra tive reform , because , other wise , we could find ourselves in a par ad o x ical situation : on the pre te xt that there is no text , on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be d en ied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior know ledge of the text s on which it is based
Therefore , Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote
(A pp la use from the P S E Group )
Madam President, I really am quite a st on ish ed at Mr B ar ó n C res p o ' s beh av i our and the fact that he is now ask ing for this item to be put on W ed n es day 's agenda
Mr B ar ó n C res p o, you were un able to att end the Conference of President s last Th urs day
I am not critic ising this ; it happ ens from time to time that people s end some one to represent them
Mr H ä n s ch represent ed you on this occasion
In the Conference of President s, we had an in - d ep th discussion
Y our Group was al one in adv oc ating what you are saying now
We then put it to a vote
As you know , each ch air man has the same number of v ot es as his Group has Members
There was a vote on this matter
As I rec all , the out come of this vote was 4 2 2 v ot es to 1 8 0 with a few ab st en tions
This means that all the Group s with the excep tion of the non- at t ach ed Members - but, of course, they are not a Group - were in agreement ; only your Group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here
All of the others were of a different opinion
That was the decision
I should now like to comment on the issue itself
We have confidence in the Commission and in R om an o Prodi and, after a difficult procedure , as everyone know s, the v ast majority of our Group support ed the vote of confidence in R om an o Prodi and the Commission
We believe , however, that the Commission' s strategic plan needs to be deb ated within a proper proced ural framework , not only on the basis of an or al statement here in the European Parliament, but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the Commission and which des c rib es this programme over the five - y ear period
There is no such document !
The Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in F e b ru ary
We have said, very well , if the Commission does not wish to introdu ce the 2000 programme as ear ly as J an u ary then we will do it in F e b ru ary
We have ag reed to this
A fter all, we do not wish to qu ar re l with the Commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to t read the same p ath
However, we in Parliament also have a superv is ory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with every thing which comes out of the Commission
I should like us to be able to do a reason able amount of prepar ation for the debate on the five - y ear programme in our Group s
You cannot prep are if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its cont ent
That is why we would recommend - and it is my imp ression that the Commission is also open to this idea - that we hold the debate on the Commission' s long -term programme up to the year 200 5 in F e b ru ary - and I hope that the Commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us - and that, at the same time, in F e b ru ary we also hold the debate on the Commission' s legislative programme for the year 2000
The fact that the subject s are conn ect ed also suggest s that we should hold the debate on both programmes together
That is why my Group firm ly reject s the proposal made by the Social ist Group
(A pp la use from the P P E - D E Group )
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Social ists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be re in st ated
( P ar liament reject ed the request ) President
S ti ll on the subject of W ed n es day ' s sitting , I have another proposal regarding the or al question on capital tax
The P P E - D E Group is reques ting that this item be taken off the agenda
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?
Madam President, I can hear a r i pp le of l au gh ter from the Social ist s. I was to ld that large sec tions of the Social ist Group were also k een to have this item taken off the agenda , because at the vote in the Conference of President s no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Social ist Group responsible for this matter
I do not know whether this information is correct , but the P P E - D E Group would , in any case, be gr ate ful if this item were rem o ved because Parliament has address ed this issue several tim es already
D ec ision s have also been adopted against a tax of this kind
That is why my Group mo ves that this item be taken off the agenda
Thank you, Mr P o et ter ing
We shall now hear Mr W ur t z spe aking against this request
Madam President, I would first ly like to point out Mr P o et ter ing ' s lack of l og ic
He has just been pre ach ing to the Group of the Party of European Social ists because they w ent back on a decision taken in a perf ect ly clear man ner at the Conference of President s, and now he is doing just the same
We discuss ed that matter and we were un an im ou s, with the excep tion of the P P E and E L D R Group s
As my fe llow ch air men will rec all , I even mentioned that it was not a matter of know ing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax , but of whether one d ared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it
It is not a lot to ask
I therefore repe at the proposal that this or al question to the Commission and the Council should be re tain ed so that we can find out , once and for all, the posi tions of these two bod ies regarding the proposal which is re lative ly mod est but which would give a clear m ess age to public opinion, particularly after the t ide of feel ing gener ated by the fail ure of the S e at t le Conference
We shall proceed to vote on the P P E - D E Group ' s request that the or al question regarding the capital tax be with d ra wn from the agenda
( P ar liament reject ed the request , with 1 6 4 v ot es for , 1 6 6 v ot es against and 7 ab st en tions )
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr P o et ter ing for ad ver tis ing this debate
Thank you very much
Madam President, has my vote been count ed ?
I was un able to vote elect ron ic ally, since I do not have a card
My vote was " in favour "
Inde ed, if we add the two Members who have dec la red themselves , then the result of the vote would be
Madam President, the Presidency has already dec la red the result of the vote
There is no ro om for amendments
Madam President, in the ear li er vote - and I will ab ide by your rul ing on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indic ated that I would like to speak in adv ance of the vote on behalf of my Group
That did not happen
I would app re ci ate it if , on the close of this item of bus ines s, I might be allow ed to give an expl an ation of vote on behalf of my Group
This is an important matter
It would be use ful for the rec ord of the House to state how people per ce ive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis
Madam President, I do not wish to re op en the debate , but I had also asked for the f lo or , to comment on Mr B ar ó n C res p o 's motion
You did not call me either
I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us le ave the matter there
I am ter rib ly s or ry , Mr H ä n s ch and Mr C o x
I did not see you ask ing to speak
E ven so , I think the posi tions are quite clear and they shall be enter ed in the Min utes
When we adopt the Min utes for today ' s sitting tomorrow , then any Members who think the posi tions have not been explain ed clearly enough may ask for amendments
This seems to me to be a work able solution
Of course, the Min utes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any addition al expl an ations
I think this is a better solution than proceed ing now to extremely time - con s um ing expl an ations of v ot es
Mr C o x , Mr H ä n s ch , would this be accept able to you ?
Madam President, if the vote rec ord s correct ly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot , ob ject to that
If your rul ing is that I cannot give an expl an ation of vote , I accept that but with res erv ations
We shall pay particular attention to the word ing of the Min ut es, as we always do , of course
If they do not proper ly ref lect the posi tions adopt ed, then we may correct them , if necessary
( T he order of business was adopted th us amend ed )
S a f ety adv is ers for the transport of dangerous goods
The next item is the report (A5- 01 0 5 /1999 ) by Mr Ko ch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adop ting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmon isation of exam in ation requirements for safety adv is ers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , ra il or in land water ways ( C 5- 0 2 0 8 /1999 - 1998 / 01 0 6 ( CO D ) )
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite f r ank in saying that I welcome the Council 's common position on harmon ising the training of safety adv is ers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , ra il or in land water way
Firstly, we needed to take action on a form al level in order to meet the requirements of Dire ctive 9 6 / 3 5 / E C , which oblig es the Member States to app oint safety adv is ers and to organ ise the tra in ing, instru ction and exam in ation of these people but does not explain this exp lic it ly
Secondly, by adop ting this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transport ed and trans h i pp ed ; b ) a redu ction in dist or tions of competition res ul ting from w ide var i ations in national training struct ures and training costs and c ) equal opportunities for safety adv is ers on the European l ab our market
Th ird ly, this directive , as it currently stand s in the common position , guarant ees - in particular because it conf ines itself exc lu sive ly to min imum standards - a high de g ree of flex ibility and mod est regulation by the European Union ; by adop ting it we contrib ute to the Member States ' bear ing a high level of individual responsibility
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be great ly wel com ed
Our amendments from the first read ing have , I believe , been taken into account very satis fact or ily
They have either been ac cep ted or transp osed with no change in the sub st ance, or they have been reject ed because the cor res pon d ing European ar r ange ments have not been includ ed, for example a system of p en al ties for vi ol ations of the rules or a comple x cl as si fication structure for rel ated groups of questions
The one un an im ous ly adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Polic y and Transport , which concerns the tim et able for implementing the directive , is something which I would urge you to support
B y not set ting a specific d ate for the Member States to implement the directive and inst ead gi ving them a period of three months after its ent ry into force , we are introdu cing a flex ibility cla use which ens ures that the directive will be implemented without delay
I would urge you to end or se this
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more f re qu ently of ac cid ents caus ing major damage on our road s, but also on our ra il ways and water way s, not so le ly but at least part ly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods serious ly enough or because - as a result of i gn or ance or a lack of training on the part of the d ri vers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a min or ac cid ent has all too often become a major disaster
As an Austrian , I still have a vi vid m em or y, as , I believe , we all do , of the c at ast ro p he which cost so many human li ves last year in the T au ern T un n el , where sub sequ ent work to re b u ild the part s of the t un n el which had been d est ro y ed in this f ire continu ed for many months at h uge exp en se
The r en ov ation project , which last ed for month s, c ut off this important r out e between the n orth and s ou th of Europe
The tra ffic which had to be di ver ted because of this st ret ch ed the pa ti ence of many th ous and s of people in the EU to the limit
In fact, all he ll bro ke lo ose in some m un ic ip al ities in my pro v ince
P re vention has to be our answer to disast ers of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well - t ra ined safety adv is ers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time
All the same , we must not cont ent ourselves with en ac ting European law to ensure greater safety
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transp osed by the Member States in good time and - even more important ly - we need to ensure that they are also appli ed after wards
P le ase let this not be yet another sector where we sub sequ ently have to l ament the lack of en for ce ment
I should like to address one final point . We must not cont ent ourselves with se al ing another ho le in the safety net and sh ut ting our e y es to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done
In this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who is with us here today, to t able an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continu ing to make it sa fer for tra ffic to trans it t un n els in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disast ers on this sc al e
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Ko ch for his report which has , at its hear t , the issue of transport safety
The report look s at the issue of harmon ising the exam in ation requirements for safety adv is ors working in the areas of transport ation of dangerous goods by road , ra il and in land water way
I congratulate him on his excellent report
Transport safety has s ad ly been in the new s rec ently : the P ad d ing t on ra il c r as h in L ond on , the ter ri ble ra il c r as h in N or way , the two av i ation c r as hes invol ving EU citizens and the nat ural disaster invol ving the E ri k a off Br itt an y - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for grant ed and that those ch ar ged with prot ec ting the public must be high ly mo tiv ated and high ly qu al if ied
The rapporteur has point ed out to the House that in its common position the Council has ac cep ted six of Parliament 's t en amendments put forward at first read ing and that the sub st ance of Parliament 's other amendments has been re tain ed
My Group will therefore support the common position and look s forward to the en act ment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another to ol in our fight to make transport in the European Union as saf e as possible
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent event s have pro ved
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments
I would like , first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his excep tion ally acc ur ate and technical work on the report and, second ly, the Commission for the proposal it has sub mitted
We are concerned here with the harmon isation of exam in ation requirements but also , in fact, with min imum requirements
This is a p ity , in a sense
N e ed less to say, safety on road s, ra il ways and in land water ways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these ty p es of transport , training for safety adv is ors should also be harmon is ed, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new A D R , for example, which is under way
This is important , but so is en for ce ment and there are , of course, a number of reason s why we need to pay particular attention to this
J ust think of the road ac cid ents which have occ ur red over recent years, for example in B el g ium , the N ether land s and a number of other countries where l or ri es carry ing dangerous goods continu ed to d ri ve in f og g y conditions when really they should have p ull ed off the road inst ead
O r ship s from East ern Europe which mo or ad j ac ent to ship s over here , with all the obvious ris ks that this ent ail s
F urther more, it has transp ire d that research in the p ort s in B el g ium , Fin land , but also in J ap an has sh own that 5 0% of contain ers with parti ally dangerous car go are not deli ver ed correct ly for ship ment
In short , the issue is an important one
If we look at the situation where safety adv is ers are concerned, in a number of countries it is comp ul s ory to employ such safety adv is ers in companies as from 1 J an u ary of this year
There will be major problems with en for cing this r ule at present , especially with small er compan ies, as these cannot aff ord safety adv is ors
These small er companies either disp ose of their car go or m i x it with other car go , which caus es problems
It is therefore also being reques ted that I S O 9 00 2 c er ti fic ates pos sib ly include the fin er detail s of these activities in the form of ann ual report s and compan y analys es
The work is done . All that remain s is the business of en for ce ment
I would like to mention one final point
With regard to en for ce ment , proper agreements must also be conclud ed with the East ern European countries because they will not enter into t rea ties which deal with this matter until 1 J u ly 200 1 , that is to say in e ight een months ' time
This gi ves them a competi tive e d ge for the inter im period
This is not in itself any thing d read ful , but we should prior iti se particularly the safety aspect s for goods transport ed by road , ra il and in land water ways and incorpor ate these , as part of the ac qu is commun a ut a ire , as soon as possible and present them to the ac ced ing states
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is high light ed on a reg ular basis in this Parliament and right ly so
The ever increasing vol u me of goods pass ing through Europe ent ail s all kind s of risk s, know n and un know n , for employ ees and the social environment
Th ose having to deal with these ris ks should therefore meet str ing ent requirements
The rele vant standards which have been la id down in another Dire ctive , 9 5 / 3 5 / E C , seem su ffic i ently ad equ ate to adv ise people in a responsible man ner on the organ isation of the transport of dangerous goods
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on min imum standards regarding exam in ations, although I would have pre fer red it if un if orm , set standards and mod ul es had been establish ed, so that c er ti fic ates would be of equal value intern ation ally
This , however, does not seem fe a sible
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perf ect ly l og ical and I can , therefore, give it my whole h ear ted support
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Ko ch on his report s which, though technical , are non eth el ess of very great signific ance for safety
I should like to make just a few comments
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am conv in ced that my request will fall on f er ti le ground - to ensure that more attention is pa id to the issue of saf et y, be it on the road s, on the water ways or at se a
Con sider ing that it is only today that we are deal ing with a Commission proposal first made on 1 9 Mar ch 1998 , even though Parliament respon d ed re lative ly quick ly, this time l ag is a little too long
This is not just the fa ult of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmon isation in this area as well
My second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the min imum standards
In principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flex ibility and country -s pe ci fic rules
However, when it comes to saf et y, I am rather s cep tical because safety in S w ed en, for example, is in principle no different from safety in German y, It aly or Austria
I can live with these min imum standard s, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very careful ly
S h ould flex ibility of this kind result in there being in ade qu ate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmon isation
My third point has also been mentioned already
As you know , like Mr R ack , I come from a trans it country , where this issue play s a particularly important role
We do not want to make the conditions of competition wor se for some countries un il ater ally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other trans it countries
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a min imum , in all countries, whether they are trans it countries or not
Mr President, I would first ly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ko ch , on his m ag n ific ent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to impro ving the text s and pres en ting this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the ap tit ud e exam in ation for safety adv is ers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , ra il or in land water way
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooper ate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Polic y, and in particular the transport group , is m ag n ific ent
The common position includ es prac tic ally all of the amendments ac cep ted by the Commission and harmon ises the min imum exam in ation requirements for safety adv is ers and, at second read ing, we can accept the amendment on the proposed d ate, which is much more real istic than the one o ri gin ally suggest ed by the Commission, bear ing in mind that we have now sp ent several years deb ating this question
V er y brief ly, I would like to thank the various Members for their inter ven tions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s prior ities in the field of transport
As Mr S i mp s on has said very correct ly, this is a process which we can never take for grant ed or regard as having come to an end
The process of increasing safety mar gin s and safety guarant ees in transport is a process which must be impro ved day by day
In this regard , I would also like to refer very brief ly to the problems of the t un n el s, which M ess r s R ack and S w ob od a have refer red to , which, in the case of Austri a, is doubt less a very sen si tive issue , and great effort should be made to improve their safety
In one of the wor st ac cid ents to have occ ur red recent ly, the goods being transport ed were not dangerous in themselves
Mar g ar ine and a few k il os of p ain t which, in principle , do not present risk s, l ed to a g en u ine disaster
Therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guarantee ing the m ax imum de g ree of safety can be further impro ved
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all ty p es of transport
This week we will be hold ing a debate here on the safety of se a transport , in light of the E ri k a disast er, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of a ir transport
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission
As I will say in the debate on the E ri k a disast er, we do not w a it until there is a disaster to deal with the question of saf et y, but we work on it even when there are no such circ um stan ces, which simply s erve to demonstr ate the urg ency for an effective response to this type of problem
I would like to repe at my app re ci ation to all the speak ers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Ko ch
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m
Transport of dangerous goods by road
The next item is the report (A5- 01 0 4 /1999 ) by Mr Ko ch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amend ing Dire ctive 9 4 / 5 5 / E C on the appro x im ation of the law s of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [ CO M ( 1999 ) 15 8 - C 5- 000 4 /1999 - 1999 / 00 8 3 ( CO D ) ]
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the appro x im ation of the law s of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which enter ed into force on 1 J an u ary 1997 , contain s a number of tr an sition al provision s which are only val id for a limited period of time, the term of val id ity being link ed to the comple tion of specific standard isation work by the C E N , that is the European Committee for St and ard isation
D el ay s in the C E N ' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive
In particular , ann e x es cannot be ad ap ted to take account of technical and industri al develop ments
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job
In this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Dire ctive 9 4 / 5 5 / E C which has been tabled for discussion today
S h ould the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be oblig ed to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the C E N comple t es its work , which would cause un n ecess ary cost and un c ertain ty
The amendment to the directive on today 's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmon isation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community
It mere ly pro l ong s tr an sition al rules by post pon ing de ad lin es, de le t es provision s which are no longer applic able , and l ay s down the proced ures for a ) carry ing out the ad h oc transport ation of dangerous goods and b ) en ac ting less str ing ent national regul ations, in particular for the transport of very small amount s of dangerous goods within str ict ly def ined local areas
The amendment to the directive is consequ ently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States ob tain more po w ers
The Commission decid es whether the Member States may imp ose certain rules of their own
In so do ing, it is support ed by a committee of exper ts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regul atory procedure
The proced ures for the ex erc ise of these implementing po w ers con fer red on the Commission were la id down a f res h in the Council D ec ision of J un e 1999
The proposal to be discuss ed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , d ates from M ay 1999 , however, and could not therefore take account of the l ates t com it olog y procedure
T w o of the amendments tabled and adopted un an im ous ly by the committee rel ate precisely to this amend ed com it olog y procedure
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as ear ly as the rec ital s and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly word ed - is set at a m ax imum of three months
In addition , the need for greater transparency has been point ed out
A further amendment allow s the Member States to imp ose more str ing ent require ment s, in particular for v ac u um t ank s, if work is done or goods are transport ed as a priority in te mp er at ures well be low - 2 0 º C
This is in the special interest of n ort her n European regions
A final amendment is intend ed to ensure that t an ks and t ank ers put into service between 1 J an u ary 1997 and the ent ry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been con st ruct ed and maintain ed in accordance with it
I do real ise that this is only a small step towards increased transport saf et y, but I would ask you to end or se this report
Mr President, colleagues , a happ y new year and m ill en n ium to you all
I am spe aking for the first time in this pl en ary part -s ession , so this is quite ex ci ting for me , a little like first lo ve , although that did last longer than two min utes
I would like to brief ly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road
It is good that this directive should be established now , as , other wise , Member States would have to amend their national act s for a very short time, a period of tr an sition , which would again mean un n ecess ary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureauc ra cy
The Commission' s proposal , however, does not take account of all the fact s, such as the co ld c li m ate that pre v ail s in the n ort her n regions
Con sequ ent ly, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Ko ch ' s int r in s ic ally excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee
My amendments concern the f ro st - res ist ance ra ting s for t ank ers carry ing these dangerous goods
A cc ord ing to the Commission' s proposal - 2 0 º C would have been su fficient
On the sh ore s of the M ed iter r an e an , it is hard to im ag ine that in L ap land te mp er at ures can fall consider ably low er than that
There is support for the EU in L ap land also , so let us re me mber them
I have th us proposed that the f ro st ra ting be low er ed to - 4 0 º C
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in n ort her n regions previous ly
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote
Mr President, with your per m ission I should like to begin by express ing my ad m ir ation for the way in which you ex ec ut ed the quick change over of the ch air m ans hip just now during the debate
I thought that it was quite su per b
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confid ent that the goods - how ever dangerous they are - which are transport ed on Europe 's road s, ra il way s, and so on are as saf e as possible
This directive is a contribution to this
What we are doing today is ess enti ally a n u is ance
The rapporteur, Mr Ko ch , to wh om we express our than ks for the work which he has done on this, has already point ed out that basic ally every thing could have been some wh at more adv an ced had it not been for the in ac tiv ity on the part of the C E N , which has been very d il atory in draw ing up and ad ap ting the directive
That is why we can only hope - and we should resol ve all of this this week - that, in 200 1 , we will fin ally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a de g ree of legal certain ty here and also so that our road s are a good deal sa fer
Mr President, the report we are discuss ing here does not, in itself , ent ail any major chang es. M ost of the proposed amendments are of a p ure ly technical nature
It is non eth el ess worth emphas ising that, each time we make this type of decision , it is good from a broad environmental pers pe ctive and it is bene fic ial because it cre ates better prior conditions for exp lo iting the pos sib ili ties of the internal market
V er y large qu an ti ties of dangerous goods are transport ed a round the EU , both on road s and ra il ways and by se a
This makes it necessary to have proper rules govern ing transport of this kind . In area after area , we are now ob tain ing common min imum regulations for the Member States
This is ext ra ordin arily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ko ch , for the work he has put in on this issue
This is also important where the pr ere qu is it es for the internal market are concerned
If we are to get a common transport market g en u ine ly up and run ning , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country
I should like to conclud e by comm en ting on a third matter which is also of signific ance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr A ri V at an en
In many way s, the pr ere qu is it es differ from one Member State to another
B y appro ving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very co ld in the n ort her n part s of the European Union
This makes it necessary to also take account of the way s in which materi als and p ack ag ing are affect ed by co ld of this kind
It is good that, in establishing the present regul ations, we can also be flex ible . I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Ko ch , but also the V ice - P resid ent of the Commission for the clear and un am b ig u ous way in which they have dec la red their support for safety in the transport sector and ac know led ged it as a priority
The reason Mr Ko ch produ ced his s ound report was because the work in the C E N and within the United N ations E conom ic Commission was proceed ing n one too exp ed iti ous ly
I would like to ask the V ice - P resid ent if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmon isation being made by these two organ isation s, and whether the EU is in a position to ha st en these harmon isation effort s, in accordance with principles that are as simp le as possible
For one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent ar r ange ment within the European Union, tra ffic does not st op at our border s, it goes be y ond them
H ence there is certainly every reason to introdu ce more far - re ach ing regional provision s
If the Commissioner is un able to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in w ri ting of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the C E N and the E conom ic Commission are at ?
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Ko ch on his m ag n ific ent work on this other report, which in a way supp le ments the debate which we held in O ct o ber on ra il transport
We all regret that the European Committee for St and ard isation ( C E N ) has not been able , in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provision s necessary for the required harmon isation within the European Union
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorpor ate differ enti ating ele ments which demonstr ate the di vers ity of this Europe of our s
A moment ag o, Mr V at an en sp o ke to us of low er te mp er at ure s, not of 2 0 de g re es be low z er o, but of 4 0 de g re es be low z er o
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorpor ate specific circ um stan ces which demonstr ate the c li m atic di vers ity of the European Union, which some tim es take the form of specific s and of conc re te requirements for the establish ment of standards and ch ar ac ter is ations of a technical nature
I would like to say, with regard to Mr S w ob od a ' s comments on the activ ity of the C E N , that we are urg ing them to spe ed up their work as much as possible because it would be ter ri ble if , despite the new de ad line , we were to find ourselves after a year and a b it with the same difficulties because their work has not been conclud ed
L ast ly, Mr President, the basic problems jus tif ying this amendment of the directive have been point ed out . We have refer red to the delay by the C E N , the amendment of certain provision s, the cons ist ency between the text of the directive and the cont ent of the ann e x es and the need to for it to be more specific
The Commission accept s all of the contribution s of the parliament ary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Ko ch , which are contain ed in the various amendment s, specifically four
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m
Structural Funds - C o hesion Fund coordin ation
The next item is the report (A5- 01 0 8 /1999 ) by Mrs Sch ro ed ter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordin ation with the C o hesion Fund : guidelines for programmes in the period 2000 - 2 00 6 [ CO M ( 1999 ) 3 4 4 - C 5- 01 2 2 /1999 - 1999 /2 1 2 7 ( CO S ) ]
Mr President, it is particularly ple as ing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regard ed as the most important issue within that part of the United K ing d om that I represent in this Parliament, namely W al es
A major part of W al es, as you know , has been grant ed Objective 1 stat us under the Structural Funds programme
It is quite clear that many people within W al es are look ing to the European Structural Funds programme to al le v i ate some of the great difficulties that we u nd ou b ted ly face
We have seen po ver ty grow ing in W al es ; and grow ing still further since 1997
We have seen the g ap between r ich and po or w id en
We are look ing, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industri al rest ruct uring but also to see a w ider improve ment in the whole of the economic b ase within the P r incip ality
What is, however, de ep ly dam ag ing for us is the belie f that in some way the gr an ting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government
It is s ad ly only a recogn ition of the very great difficulties that W al es fa ces
That is why I want to high light some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the fore f ron t
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to addition ality
We are dis s a tis f ied with the fact that those f ig ures seem to have been in some way h id den within U K f ig ures
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is mat ch ed funding for projects
We look to it to challenge the U K Government , to ensure that the priv ate sector , which sure ly must be provid ing the major im pe t us for Structural Funds exp end it ure , is involved in the planning stage
Finally, we ask that the Commission ens ures that Structural Fund mon ies are sp ent in a way which is transpar ent
To o much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transpar ent
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great f ri end to W al es
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differ ently and, to start , I will speak from the point of view of research
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusion s, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee ' s proposal that the C o hesion Fund countries should broad en the research inf ra st ruct ure by loc ating un i ver si ties and colle g es in such a way that they would s erve those who live in u nd e velop ed regions better than now and make it e a si er for e du c ated people to remain in their home dist ric ts
This will be possible with action on the part of government s, and such dec entral isation of high er e du c ation will be an un ques tion ably use ful policy in even ing out development
A not her matter we would like to add res s, specifically from the point of view of industri al policy, is that we would have li k ed the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of servic es, elect ron ic comm er ce and the grow ing use of the Intern et , when they were planning the coordin ation of Structural Funds and C o hesion Funds
P over ty and we alth used to dep end more on means of live li ho od
The r ich areas were those where there were jobs in industry , but today those areas might have become a b ur den , and they may well be po or , mean ing we also have to invest in new sect ors of industry such as elect ron ic produ ction , as I might call it, and the produ ction of servic es, because they are the industri es of the future
In my opinion the committee dra f ting the report has not taken su fficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Ind ustry , E x tern al T ra de , R es earch and En erg y, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue
Finally, as the committee rep res en ting energ y, we would have li k ed the issue of support for renew able energy resources from C o hesion and Regional De velop ment funds to have been emphas ised still more , th u s, through a process of coordin ation, increasing the use of renew abl es so that the sc ant funding resources in the energy programme might have been comp ens ated by means of these more substan ti al su ms
Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Sch ro ed ter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am spe aking for my colleag ue , Mrs F la ut re , who follow ed this for the Committee on E mployment and Social Affairs but who is unfortun ately i ll
I would like to draw people 's attention to Amend ments N os 1 and 2 which were ag reed by the Committee on E mployment and Social Affairs but not ac cep ted by the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support finan cially local sch em es to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion
In the past , this Parliament has view ed the social economy as an important potential provid er of employment
These amendments also f it in with this Parliament 's view that social exc lusion is a serious issue need ing con stru ctive action
We hope that those consider ing re jec tion of these amendments have very power ful reason s to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seek ing employment
In her report, Mrs F la ut re also d re w attention to an area where coordin ation is s ore ly lack ing, yet des per ately needed
The Commission proposals refer to the four p ill ar s of employment strategy and the five field s of action of the European Social Fund
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regret t ed, as the idea of link ing Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2 00 6 programme
It could be said that the o m ission gi ves the imp ression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide m ax imum coordin ation between European Social Fund assist ance, which is subject to review after three and a h alf years, and the Member States ' ann ual national plans for employment
We hope that the Commission can reas s ure us that this was an over si ght which is now being deal t with con stru ctive ly
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its m and ate, is a reason able st ar ting point for the Committee on Ag ric ulture and R ural De velop ment
I would like to point out , however, that this st ar ting point indic ates to us the chall eng es which face us : maintain ing a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all ty p es of economic activ ity o w ing to agric ulture ' s increasing lack of importance among st the various sour ces of inc ome for rural soci ety
This , as well as the de fic i en ci es in the net wor ks of inf ra st ruct ures and services and a gener ally very low level of employment , which further more is se as on al and lack s di vers ity , ex ac er b ates the ex od us from rural areas
The consequ ences do not ins p ire hope
It is the y oun g people who are dis ap pe ar ing, who are get ting an e du c ation and find ing work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an un f av oura ble effect on those areas
This lack of inf ra st ruct ure is also an ob st ac le to the establish ment of companies and the cre ation of jobs
We have to re me mber that rural areas represent al most four f if th s of the ter rit ory of the European Union
Ag ric ulture only provid es 5 . 5 % of employment in the Union
F urther more, three qu arter s of our farm work ers are part - ti me and require supp le ments to their inc om es
For this reason , one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agric ult ural sector , in sect ors such as rural to ur ism, sp ort , culture , her it age cons erv ation, the con ver sion of business es, new techn olog ies, servic es, e t c . However, even though the role of agric ulture is not exc lu sive , it is still essential , not only to prevent economic and social dis int eg ration and the cre ation of g h ost to wn s, but also because farm ers play a fundamental role in man ag ing the l and , in pres er ving b i od i vers ity and in prot ec ting the environment
Therefore , we support the establish ment of an agric ult ural and rural development policy which is cons ist ent with the objectives we have set . We want rural areas, at the d a wn of the 2 1 st cent ur y, to be competi tive and mul ti -f unction al , both with regard to agric ulture and with regard to open ing up to the di vers ity of non- ag ric ult ural activities
It is important to prior iti se general criteria for l and planning and dem o graph ic equ ili b ri um , and to bear in mind the conclusion s of the Committee on Ag ric ulture and R ural De velop ment on the five fundamental issues , which have been only part ly taken up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Polic y and T our ism in its points 1 6 and 1 7
In conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusion s on the four p ill ar s because I believe that, for the European Union, maintain ing the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thank ing Mrs Sch ro ed ter , the rapporteur, for her work
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well
I would also like to thank her for her will ing ness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when comprom ise form ul as have needed to be reached in the face of this av al an ch e of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expect ed - but which g en u ine ly ref lect the importance of the report we are now discuss ing
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusion s adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a u sel ess ex erc ise , and nothing but h ot a ir
The tr uth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also sh own in the way the conclusion s have been dra f ted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an inter im re vision of these dire ctives
In our amendment s, we have st ated the importance of the necessary sy n erg ies being produ ced between the Structural Fund s, the C o hesion Fund and Community initiatives , so that their application should be ref lect ed, in the best and most pro fit able way , by the g ra du al e li mination of disp ar ities between regions and by the cre ation of jobs which are , when all is said and done , the two central purp os es of the funds we are discuss ing
In order to achieve a more r ap id and effic ient bo ost for at tain ing these objectives , we think that those who gener ate employment , the real ent re pr ene urs and those who really guarantee new sour ces of employment , that is, business pe ople , must particip ate in this initiative
S m all and medium -si zed business es, above all, need to take part in the dist rib ution of these funds
If they do not, if business pe ople feel mar gin al is ed, if ent re pr ene urs cannot take part , not only in man ag ing but also in recei ving these fund s, we will have mis s ed an opportunity to at tain our objectives more r ap id ly
Al so , in order to at tain our objectives , to over come the disp ar ities between regions and to seek out sour ces of employment , it is crucial to give our complete support to new techn olog ies, to transport and communic ations net wor ks and to renew able energ ies
All of this must be done - I repe at - with the participation of priv ate bus ines s, which, by un iting its efforts with those of public administration s, but comp lementing them , never ob stru c ting or exc lud ing them , will lead to the cre ation of we alth in soci ety and of jobs
Mr President, it is inc um b ent upon me to remind my colleag ue , Mr E v an s, of why W al es actually achie ved Objective 1 stat us
It was because of the disc red ited policies of his own Con s erv ative Party
Let me also remind him that when his party lead er, Mr H ag ue , was Sec ret ary of State for W al es, he bro ke every r ule in the bo ok on addition ality which l ed to a st ern let ter from Commissioner W ul f- M ath ies regarding regul atory requirements
I can tell you that the B ri tis h Government is aware of its regul atory requirements on Objective 1 addition ality
I suggest Mr E v ans goes back and read s the regulation
My Group has made ext ensive amendments to both report s up for debate today
I want to focus our mind s on the essential role of the guidelines
The objective is to provide a framework and to ol to support and en h ance economic reg ener ation, to get the most effective use of resources in the w id est partnership and to put these regions back on the road to rec over y and sustainable development so that event ually they come off the regional life -s u pport m ach ine
It is important to i d enti f y the s k ill s and potential of our regions in the h i - t ech sector
It is particularly important in the light of report s in the medi a that Europe is r ap id ly l os ing ground to the U S in the h i - t ech grow th industri es of the future
The oper ation of the previous r ound of programmes is also very instru ctive in tell ing us what guidelines should not be about
They should not be about creating addition al l ay ers of bureauc ra cy and red t a pe
They should not be about sh if ting prior ities and policies h alf way through project development, res ul ting in in e v it able delay s and u nd ers p end s, particularly in the light of the new budget ary require ment
The implementation and oper ation of the guidelines cannot be left to the person al inter p ret ation of one or other des k offic er, either in the Commission or in the civil service
There must be an internal co her ence in the Commission direct or ate, while res pe c ting the specific local and regional aspect s of Commission programmes
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indic ative and flex ible to assist our programme man ag ers and fund - us ers and to get the m ax imum potential out of our new field s of reg ener ation
If we can in ject a spirit of ent re pr ene ur ial activ ity into our po or and struct ur ally weak regions we will event ually get them back on t o the road of att rac ting substan ti al invest or confidence , which will be the key to future success
This is how we are going to jud ge the success of these guidelines : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , en abl ing guidel ine , can open up new opportunities and allow our po or and struct ur ally weak regions to play their full part in contrib u ting to the grow th and pro s per ity of the EU
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Sch ro ed ter for an excellent report
S he has g one into the issue in some dep th and in the committee debate she to ok account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report
The rapporteur has also quite right ly st ated that Parliament was not he ard in time regarding the guidelines
We are b ad ly behind now in this matter
H ope ful ly, the stand s Parliament has taken will help , however, in the m id -term app ra is al of the programmes and in their practical implementation
For the time, the report gre w too large when it was being deb at ed. It contain ed detail s and issues that had already been raised in previous report s
At this stage it is more important to concentr ate on assess ing how we can use this process to st e er Union regional policy, bear ing in mind that the aim is to redu ce regional in equ ality
Our Group emphas ises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of Member States and the role of local play ers in dra f ting and implementing programm es. It is especially important to get S M E s involved in the planning and implementation of programmes
Our Group also con sid ers it important to take greater account of rem ote and peri p her al areas and wishes to increase inter action between to wn s and rural areas
We opp ose the ex ces sive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States ex erc ises and we are call ing for a redu ction in the bureauc ra cy that has taken ro ot in the dra f ting and implementation of programmes
Pro ject s implemented with support from the Union have had their effect water ed down all too often by s low decision making and comp lic ated administ ra tive process es
Funds have often been grant ed for projects which have had no l as ting benefit for the area concern ed. Pro ject s have to be carried out more effic ient ly, more flex ib ly and they have to be made more produ ctive
Wh ile the report was being prepared , it was inter es ting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general
For us new member s, it was the first time, and this was a very inter es ting process
This report is very good and our Group support s it
Mr President, Commissioner, as pro o f that this Parliament has not yet over come its role as a consult ative and sub ordin ate institution , the excellent report by a fe llow member of my Group , E l is ab eth Sch ro ed ter , has not been able to reach pl en ary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 - 2 00 6 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offic es for several months
B ear ing this in mind , this House should , in any event , demand that, before the Community support frame wor ks for the period in question are appro v ed, they be stud ied and sub mitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today . This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the po ore st and least - de velop ed regions and we would th us contrib ute to re vers ing the harm ful tr end s towards in equ ality that exist in European soci ety and to the move towards a fa ir er Europe
Mr President, we should not for get that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and C o hesion Funds and of their coordin ation is to achieve economic and social cohesion
We are oblig ed to particip ate in dra f ting dire ctives and also in assess ing their results
We are oblig ed to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of C itiz ens and not just in a Europe of States and of Reg ion s
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but ins u fficient condition for achie ving economic and social cohesion
We might be m ist ak en in using the g ross d om es tic product per in h ab it ant as the so le indic ator
S ome speak ers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population
We will have to stud y several indic ator s, which will en able us to see the current state of regional soci e ties that are in a wor se situation than other s, and how they are e v ol ving
It is clear from some of the report s that have been presented to Parliament' s pl en ary sitting today that Europe ' s 2 5 most pro sp erous regions en j o y a level of unemployment which is five tim es low er than in the 2 5 least pro sp erous regions
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act dec is ive ly and strategic ally
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliament ary term - to discuss the dire ctives
I do not think , however, that this report has come too l ate
We need to consider it together , so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been dra f ted before the dire ctives come into force , can be sub mitted for re vision and proper assess ment
We all agree that we should ask that, h alf way through these programm es, when the assess ment of the dire ctives is made , Parliament should be given an equ ally inf lu ential role on the ground s that we are the citizens ' representatives
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureauc ra tic
They need to see the political di men sion work ing, to see that official s accept their respon sib ili ties and that there is communication with the citizens
This is what we are today ask ing the Commissioner for
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indic ator s, and a strateg y, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just produ c tiv ity
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the C o hesion Fund for the period 2000 - 2 00 6 and the main recommend ations of the report which include the following : there must always be an integr ated approach to the sp ending of EU Structural and C o hesion Funds
This means that there must be a compreh ensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be sp ent
Member States are urg ed to att ach greater importance to integr ated strateg ies for rev ital ising relations between to wn s and rural areas. This l at ter point is of particular importance
Wh ile urban renew al in our c ities is very important we must always st ri ke a bal ance in our policies between prom oting rural development and impro ving the li ves of c ity d w e ll ers
We do not want to build a Europe of c ities al one
The Structural Funds have play ed a key role in the development both of urban and rural part s of peri p her al countries, main ly through the up gra d ing of road s, water treat ment and rel ated transport net wor ks
This process will continue in accordance with the financial sp ending guidelines la id down by the EU lead ers at their B er lin S um mit last year , which were support ed by Parliament at its last M ay pl en ary part -s ession
K ey EU programmes between 1 9 8 9 , 199 3 , 199 4 and 1999 have certainly help ed to improve the economic competi tiveness of peri p her al countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe
The key now is to con so lid ate and make per man ent the progress made to d ate
This would ensure that the peri p her al countries and the u l t ra p eri p her al regions, the po or er regions in Europe, are in a position to oper ate successful ly within the new e uro currency z one , as well as within an ever - e x p and ing internal market where the free movement of good s, person s, services and capital exist
In conclusion , while key inf ra st ruct ure projects have been support ed by the European Regional De velop ment Fund and the C o hesion Fund , we should re me mber that the European Social Fund has play ed a very important role in help ing the less well -o ff in our soci ety
The Social Fund has certainly impro ved our third - le vel institution s, finan ced our post - le a ving c er ti fic ate programmes and put in place compreh ensive sch em es to help combat you th and long -term unemployment , assist ear ly sch o ol le a vers and promote high er standards of ad ult l iter ac y
Mr President, on num erous occasion s in the past I have dis ag reed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues . This time, however, I actually agree with her
Wh ether or not this will encoura ge her to continue al ong the same p ath , I cannot say . N ever thel ess, I would like to comm end her on her work
The second point I would like to make is that we would have pre fer red it if the guidelines had been add ed to the regulation in the form of an ann e x , as we and Mrs M c C ar th y, as rapporteur s for the general regul ation, had asked
Un fortun ately, this did not happen . Mr B ern i é is not to b la me for this as it was a matter for the previous committee
I am ra ising the issue just to re iter ate Parliament' s position
Th ird ly, we broad ly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not dev i ate from the comments we have made so far
They are particularly bene fic ial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphas is the Commission has pla ced on the issues of sustainable development, job cre ation and, more particular ly, on equal opportunities and transport issues
P ers on ally, I at least am tot ally in favour of the guidelines
As an is la nder , however, I would like to express my dis s a tis f action at the lack of recogn ition of is land development
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it des er ves . This has been an on go ing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again
Commissioner, we shall continue to ra ise the issue , as Article 15 8 , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provid es for an integr ated policy for is land s
Therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all
The time has come to implement the programm es, and so Member States should also ass u me their respon sib ili ties and do their jobs proper ly
As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the cod e of con du ct between the Commission and Parliament which was sign ed in M ay
I am absolutely certain that this cod e will be obs er ved and that Parliament will keep ab re ast of all the develop ments and detail s concerning the implementation of the programmes
Mr President, Commissioner, in this min ute and a h alf I should like , first of all, to congratulate Mrs Sch ro ed ter
I know many have already done so , but she has indeed ear n ed our p ra ise for being particularly open and att en tive to proposals from all s id es, and I think it is this open ness which has given her report the quality we see today
I share the reg re ts she express ed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather l ate in the day as regards these guidel in es, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far adv an ced that I cannot see this report having any s ort of immedi ate effect , which in my view is a p ity
Con sequ ent ly, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the m id -term review in 200 3 , and th us have an inf lu ence on the second ph ase of programm ing set to follow 200 3
In brief , I would like to say that we are enter ing the period when we are call ed upon to manage the programm ing for 2000 - 2 00 6 , which must be no r ou tin e period for the good reason that we have two major chall eng es to face
The first is the harmon isation of national development policies and regional development policies
S ub sid ies are not enough to ensure development when inf ra st ruct ure and public services are lack ing
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that Union policy inter f ac es with the subsidi ary national policies for regional development ?
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course, have a consider able imp act , both in budget ary and g e o graph ical terms
These are two areas of action which I inv ite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us
Finally, in this time of nat ural disast ers, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds
As you know , it is up to each State to red ist rib ute part of the total appropri ation
Europe should not be completely abs ent, as the states t end to want
Public opinion and the press now ad ay s acc use us of being un av ail able to give a response , even though we are going to be funding a large prop or tion of the national oper ations
I think we should be cap able of saying this l ou d and clear
I also think we should ensure , or ask Member States to ensure , that there is some public ity given to European aid when ever it is used to rep air damage caus ed by nat ural disast ers or ac cid ents
Mr President, the priority given to financial and mon etary criteria re in for ces the increase in in equ al ities of every sh a pe and form
As far as French planning exper ts are concerned, for example, the most prob able sc en ar i o today is that of the ent r ench ment of regional disp ar ities within each country
We ll , the Structural Funds have help ed to apply a b ra ke to this process
Our project of a Europe that aim s to satis f y social needs env is ag es the con ver g ence of living conditions towards the high est common d en om in ator
It s implementation would certainly require ext ending the scope of red ist rib ution instru ments such as the Structural Funds
What we are propos ing specifically is a un if ied capital tax , which would make it possible to bo ost the funds used to support the harmon isation of social protection system s and the redu ction of working h our s at European level
The Commission, however, though b ound to issue guidel in es, does so only re lu ct ant ly and in a v ag ue man ner
The report put forward today re - est ablish es its place in the political sp h ere
It is one of the step s towards a policy of employment and sustainable development
This is what pers u ad es us to vote in favour of it
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work
O ver the coming years, fa ced with the chall eng es of global isation and e ast ward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detail ed guid ance on how to plan and rev ital ise its economy
To this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individ u ally, will have to make op tim um use of all available resources and cap a ci ti es, including the Structural Funds
For this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission are not just good intention s, but clear er guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States
For example, in recent years It aly has had problems in u til ising the Structural Fund s, main ly because of ex ces sive bureauc ra cy , ins u fficient information and a lack of involve ment of economic and social oper at ors at local level
Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consult ation as a means of ens uring proper coordin ation and participation by all local and regional oper at ors in decision -m aking , precisely so that im bal an ces and in equ al ities can be avoid ed. Secondly, a g en u ine effort is required to make administ ra tive proced ures simp ler and more transpar ent, since , they are all too often un n ecess arily l ength y and comp lic at ed, to the point of h in der ing access to the Funds
I will conclud e, Mr President, by saying that the fail ure of the Commission' s communication to focus on terr itor ial p act s and, espe ci ally, m eth od s of comb ating unemployment among women and y oun g people , is cause for serious concern
Mr President, like my colleag ue Mr E v an s, it is a particular ple as ure to r ise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United K ing d om , the W est M id land s, which has h ither t o bene f ited from Objective 2 funding in particular
But the report before the House t on ight is a pri me example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produ ce very g rand i ose -s ound ing ide as that lack the sub st ance to make them rele vant to the people who benefit direct ly from them
The report itself is well - int ention ed but, as so often when we deal with these issues , lack s cl arity of purp ose and a s ound basis for oper ability
That is why I and my Group are propos ing three key amendments and ad ditions to the text , not to take any thing away from the proposal , but to make it more rele vant to those wh om it is there to guid e
I would like to explain our think ing here
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and C o hesion Funds
P ast experience d ict ates that, as the elect ed representatives of the European tax p ay er, we should , and indeed must , demand financial prob ity and transparency in the dis b ur se ment and a ud iting of this mone y, h ence our amendments and ad ditions rel ate to achie ving what are know n as " val ue for money " indic at ors in the grant - g i ving process
N ext , we all too often see v ast su ms of money being sp ent on projects whose out com es will necess arily be un c lear at the start of the programme period
But at the m id - way point or end of that period there is no effective way of ter min ating the project if it has not pro ved successful
Our ad ditions therefore call for the provision of practical en for ce able ex it strateg ies so that not only can we have the requ is ite ins ur ance against on go ing costs which are often lo ad ed on t o the tax p ay er, but we also avoid the well - reh ear s ed sy nd ro me of th row ing good money after b ad
Finally, we call for a change to the bal ance and m eth od by which the funds are dis b urs ed
There should be greater involve ment of the priv ate sector which will introdu ce financial reality as a pers pe ctive within the funding equ ation
Al so the type of project fund ed needs to be sh if ted away from small -s c al e re ven ue -b ased project s, which are hard to monitor , towards capital sch em es where , in the majority of cas es, the benefit s are there for all to see
That way the much - t r um pe ted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the te mp t ation to draw un n ecess arily in the longer term on the local tax b ase in areas where such projects are loc ated will be di min ish ed and the European Parliament will show how serious ly it takes the need for such reform
If these changes to the report are support ed by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next ph ase of achie ving the hist or ic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a finan cially sustainable man ner - those de pri ved areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a dec ent standard of living , not by gi ving a hand - out but by gi ving a " h and - up "
I urge the House to support these changes
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to comm end the rapporteur on her report, which is a me tic ul ous and substan tive p ie ce of work
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are , without doubt , essential to ol s for creating the right conditions with a view to t ack ling and redu cing the level s of economic and social disp arity between the regions
D es pite the step s taken th us far , these level s are still very high , and are unaccept ably high as regards unemployment
These policy objectives can only be achie ved through their careful coordin ation and organ isation on the basis of well thought - out and sen sible guidelines
Let us not for get that when these policies are effective , they also benefit European citizens by direct ly impro ving their quality of life
Let us not for get either that greater consideration should be given to the is land s and rem ote regions of the European Union because their g e o graph ical loc ation is a h ind r ance to their economic and social development, un less of course the Commission is intend ing to build bri d g es or under w ater t un n els link ing them to the European main land
In clos ing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flex ibility so that they can ad ap t to chang ing circ um stan ces and there b y respon d to the new chall eng es and opportunities of the new m ill en n ium , for which we all hope for the best
Mr President, Mrs Sch ro ed ter ' s report u nd ou b ted ly contain s several important obs erv ations, and I would like to congratulate her on that
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the act ual dire ction and out come of the Community ' s regional policy
Q u ite brief ly, structural policy does not e ase the problem of m ass unemployment in any way , rather it ag gra v ates it
The agric ult ural economy and agric ult ural regions have been ir re p ar ably dam aged by the existing regional policy, which has had dra m atic consequ ences on employment level s in rural areas and on the living conditions of farm ers, particularly in the S ou th
Regional disp ar ities are bec om ing much more mark ed within the Member States
If we exam ine the d at a presented in the six th period ic report, we will see that the last dec ade has w it ness ed a pro li fer ation of regional disp ar ities
L ittle consider ation, if any at all, has been given to the great problems fa cing the is land regions of the Union whose short com ings as regards inf ra stru c ut res structure , transport , communication and energy has result ed in their g ra du al dep op ul ation
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to b la me for that as its regional policy
A large sec tion of the Union' s population has strong ly con d em n ed this policy for being dangerous and anti gr ass - ro ot s
Un fortun ately, the new guidelines seem to be he ad ing in the same dire ction and there are no sign s that things will change once they have been implemented
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to high light two points made in these report s which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union
The first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion
We are concerned to hear new s that the Commission is taking this objective less serious ly
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives
Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the is land s and I would also like to bring the out er most regions to your attention
In future , we would like to see greater amb ition appli ed to the subject of the out er most regions such as , in my country , the is land s of the A z ore s and M ade i ra
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to en light en us on the reason s for the delay in the Commission' s report on the out er most regions, which has been long aw a ited by Parliament ?
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being will ing to include in the report the sugg es tions we made
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intend ed to help st e er the Member States towards achie ving the reform objectives contain ed in the programmes
However, cont r ary to their cla im to provide guid ance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are remin is c ent to a far greater extent of a c at alogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas
N on eth el ess, their true purp ose is to give dire ction and to set prior ities
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortun ately the Commission document contain s too little in the way of recommend ations to the Member States on simp li f ying administ r ation, and I support the call s for negotiations to concentr ate on prom oting a fa v oura ble c li m ate for l ab our - int ensive , small and medium -si zed enter p ris es, on set ting clear objectives for al tern ative sour ces of finan cing including provision s for risk capital and priv ate finan c ing, and on start - up help for companies including new information techn olog ies and invest ment in innov ative field s
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 1 0 , to ensure an appropriate level of priv ate sector involve ment in the planning and implementation of the projects
I should be very gr ate ful , Mrs Sch ro ed ter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deli ber ations
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on E mployment and Social Affair s, we up he ld un an im ous ly the crit er ion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the inter ven tions of the Structural and C o hesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the une mploy ed and for equ ality between m en and women
Un fortun ately, the excellent Sch ro ed ter report did not take account of this crit er ion , despite the fact that there is consider able e vid ence to show - as we shall see l ater in the B er end report - how , in fact, these funds are provid ing sp l end id assistance to the most back ward regions in order to bri d ge the g ul f that s ep ar ates them from Europe ' s most high ly - de velop ed regions
They are grow ing, but only in terms of G D P
They are increasing in competi tiveness but they are not all experi en cing an increase in we alth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differ ences in employment opportunities between regions
Commissioner, ple ase read the opinion of the Committee on E mployment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is our citizens ' gre ates t problem
P le ase take account , in strategic term s, in the re vision and in the alloc ation of res er ves , of employment need s, because this, fund ament ally is what the Structural Funds and the C o hesion Funds require
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines he ad in the right dire ction and that they guarantee the effec tiveness of the programmes of the crucial se ven - y ear period 2000 - 2 00 6 so as to ensure sustainable development and job cre ation, particularly for women and y oun g people , and ensure a bal ance is st ru ck between economic and social policy and regional policy
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agric ult ural regions and equal development opportunities for the is land s of the European Union and for the G ree k is land s which, of course, comp r ise h alf of the is land s of the Union, as sti pul ated in Article 15 8 of the Treaty
C o hesion policy needs to be strengthen ed further because a Europe which tot ally dis reg ard s the standard of living in its regions can ne ither be re li able or vi able
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in list ening careful ly to the comment s, occasion al critic is ms and sugg es tions that some of you have just made in your speech es with reference to Mrs Sch ro ed ter ' s report
E ver y one understand s, Mrs Sch ro ed ter , ladies and gentlemen, the reason s and the time limit s involved - and I shall come back to this point present ly - and wh ate ver the time limit s or delay s, since we are discuss ing this report right now , as the represent ative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been iss u ed at an opportun e moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000 - 2 00 6 as it is now that we are st ar ting the new regional programm ing
Mrs Sch ro ed ter , you quite right ly point ed out that while it is ch ie f ly up to the Member States and the regions to def ine their own prior ities in development matter s, European Union co f in an cing of the programmes require s, and is the jus ti fication for , a situation where Community prior ities as deb ated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you force ful ly point ed out
So , ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to ret urn to the role and structure of the guidelines before mention ing the princip al comments and critic is ms that you, Mrs Sch ro ed ter , and the various Members of this House , have made
Reg ard ing the role and structure of these guidel in es, Mr H at z id ak is , Mrs Sch ro ed ter and Mrs M c C ar th y mentioned that the purp ose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in prepar ing their programm ing strategy for each of Structural Fund Objec tives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their link s with the C o hesion Funds
This means put ting forward the Commission' s prior ities, based on past experience in implementing the programm es, as well as current Community policies relating to structural oper ations
The objective is that these prior ities should contrib ute to the better use , to the op tim um and effic ient use , as some of you have wish ed, of Community involve ment , includ ing, Mr B ra d bour n , us ing, if necessary , the perf orm ance res erve which is specifically intend ed to encoura ge the op tim um and effic ient use of European public mon ies
When I speak of op tim um u til is ation, I am refer ring both to the national and regional level s. And so , Mr S e pp ä n en, I shall also mention at this point , spe aking of the national level , the link with the C o hesion Fund
This is the purp ose of these guidelines
Reg ard ing their cont ent, as you know , ladies and gentlemen of this House , they are focus ed on three strategic prior ities that your rapporteur point ed out very clearly but, at the same time, very p as sion ately, as I under st o od her present ation just now
The first priority is to improve the competi tiveness of regional econom ies in order to create , in all sector s, but especially in the priv ate sector , as Mr B er end said, the m ax imum number of seri ou s, worth wh ile and per man ent job s, the competi tiveness of regional econom ies, all regional econom ies, and in particular , Mr E v an s, that of W al es, but not only of W al es
And , because there are a number of you who have just point ed out what appe ared to you to be an o m ission , let me also add the regional econom ies of the European regions hand ic app ed by their dist ance from the cent re , be they rem ote regions, is land regions or , of course, the most rem ote regions which are , nat ur ally, the most dist ant
P er haps I may inform Mr R ib e i ro e C ast ro , who asked me about this, that, as I w ro te to the presid ents of each of these most rem ote regions, the Commission did indeed request an ext ension of several wee ks before p ub lish ing its anti cip ated report
Con c ern ing the most rem ote regions, it was only quite be l ated ly that we received the m em or and um s from the various government s, but this is not necess arily an ex cu se , just an expl an ation
We must therefore take these m em or and um s into consideration and produ ce an extremely th or ough p ie ce of work
I myself to ok part in a meeting of the most rem ote regions on 2 3 No ve mber and, within the C ol le ge , we considered that we would need several more wee ks before being able to produ ce a report that deal t appropri ately with the extremely serious problems and li ved up to the expect ations of these most rem ote region s. I would thank you for your understand ing in this matter
So that is the first priority , the competi tiveness of regional econom ies
The second priority , which several of you have stress ed, Mr P u er t a in particular , but there were other s, not that I am mention ing them in any order of priority , is the strengthen ing of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by ra ising the prof ile of human resources far more so than in the past
L adies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disp ar ities between countries are obs er ved to be less great , pro ving the effec tiveness and worth of the C o hesion Fund , but where , at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you w ro te , Mrs Sch ro ed ter - an increasing g ap ex ists between the 15 or 2 0 r ich est regions and the 15 or 2 0 po ore st or most dis ad vant aged region s. This is a situation which is, as it should be , un j us tif i able and int ol er able
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own con cept of the con struction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention , as far as possible , with your support , of d ed ic ating all the appropri ations for which I am responsible to this impro ved social , human and terr itor ial cohesion , particularly in order to prevent what I once call ed in this House a two -s pe ed Europe, a Europe of we alth y dist ric ts but, at the same time, a Europe of imp over ish ed areas
In fact, the guidelines take two h or i z on t al principles into account . The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Sch ro ed ter , that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue I have been involved in person ally for a long time
I particularly re me mber the time when I was Minister for the En v ironment in my own country . The second principle is that of equal opportun ities, particularly for m en and women , as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and mon etary Union
Finally, and in order to respon d to the concerns which you have expressed in this House , particularly your self , Mrs Sch ro ed ter , in these guidelines we rec all the importance and the defin ition of integr ated strateg ies, for development or red e velop ment , which, of all the prior ities, offer the m ax imum opportunity to sy n erg y, to the measures undert ak en and to the establish ment of a dec entral ised partnership
You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there is a clear reference to it on p age 5 of the guidelines
However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I sp ent long enough as a regional administ rat or within my own country to be able to say this most s in c ere ly - is a to ol , one used to involve local b ra in p ow er, be it in the public sector , in the form of elect ed representatives , the social and e du c ational sector s, as soci ations, or in the priv ate sector ; a dec entral ised partnership , and let me mention in this connection , in response to Mrs An ge li ll i , the terr itor ial p act s, which are one of the means available to this dec entral ised partnership
These are the reason s why the guidelines are presented according to them atic prior ities, since they must be taken into consider ation, under each of the objectives , to different ext ents in accordance with the specific situ ations of each of the Member States and regions
I should now like to respon d brief ly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen, and first ly on procedure
It is true that consult ation with Parliament has only come about at a l ate d ate
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in F e b ru ary 1999 , in line with a new procedure intend ed to make it e a si er to present comments on this text , my pre d ecess or , Mrs W ul f- M ath ies, presented them to Parliament immedi ately
D ue to the ele ctions to the European Parliament taking place a round this time, however, Parliament was not able to undert ake its exam in ation of these guidelines until after the text had been defin i tive ly adopt ed, in J u ly 1999
H ere in this Ch am ber , ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to ass ure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just begin ning - Mr H at z id ak is asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your obs erv ations will certainly be taken into consideration
And let me ass ure you, further more, that when the Commission adop ts the guidelines with what we call the m id -term review in mind , in line with the regul ations, then the point of view of this House , as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account
N ow to the form
On the subject of the role of the guidel in es, Mrs Sch ro ed ter , you point ed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives , often very precise on es, should be provided
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing inter se ct or al polic ies, increasing efficiency in the use of public fund s, ass isting the various partners in draw ing up regional or national programm ing together , e t c . The Commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are rel ated more to other document s, such as the G u ide to the R ef orm of the Structural Funds or the m eth od ological working document
D ra w ing to a close , I should like to focus on a number of chall eng es which you re iter at ed, Mrs Sch ro ed ter
I am think ing, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommend ations
This cla im that your report makes must be seen in the context of last sp ring ' s negotiations
The Commission k ep t to the act ual text of Article 1 0 of the Structural Funds regul ations, which sti pul ates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad , indic ative guidelines on rele vant and ag reed Community policies
I actually qu oted the text itself , in qu ot ation mark s
M ore over , the guidelines may not sub s tit ute for the programm ing or the ex an te assess ments which must be the to ol used to speci f y prior ities and the effec tiveness of these programmes
You then mention ed, Mrs Sch ro ed ter , the sec tion of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, po in ting out that urban development was not su ffic i ently taken into consideration
I find the opp os ite the case
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission att ach es, and shall att ach , to the urban di men sion of our cohesion policy
Inde ed, I had occasion rec ently to say as much to all the min ister s responsible for urban policy at a meeting in T amp ere
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up , particularly Mrs R ed ond o J im é ne z , the guidelines are in line with the two f o ld objective mentioned by your rapporteur : a strong agric ult ural sector link ed with increased competi tiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe ' s rural her it age
It must , however, be stress ed that the guidelines under discussion are rel ated only to the Structural Fund s, whose Objec tives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the di ver si fication of rural soci ety as a priority
And inde ed, on the subject of the bal ance of rural soci et y, let us not for get that there is also the new rural development policy co f in an ced by the E A G G F G u arant ee S ection , aim ed at prom oting reform in European agric ulture and supp or ting the mul tif unction al aspect of agric ulture
At this stage , I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integr ated into the programm ing for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the E A G G F G u id ance S ection is for Objective 1 regions
In any event , I app re ci ate the v ig il ance of your Committee on Ag ric ulture and R ural De velop ment in this matter
B e fore conclud ing, I should like to tell Mr S av ary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequ ences of the st orm s which have st ru ck Fr ance, Austria and German y, in particular , in the last few week s, and at the same time we shall once again be discuss ing, together with my fe llow Commissioner, Mrs de Pal a ci o, what less ons we might draw in the matter of the oil sp ill age which has also affect ed the co ast s of France
I shall therefore res erve the right , if you per mit , s ir , to give you my own opinion, which, to a great ext ent, mat ch es your own recommend ation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil sp ill age using Objective 2
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be appro ving the Objective 2 z on ing plans for Fr ance, S w ed en, Austria and L u x em bour g tomorrow
We shall then have an appropriate to ol for work ing, particularly in the majority of the regions affect ed by the st orm s
Inde ed, this is my reason for pay ing a person al vis it the day after tomorrow to two of the French dep art ments which have been sever e ly dis abled by the st orm s
In conclusion , with than ks for your understand ing, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Sch ro ed ter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that I am very ple as ed, ap art from a few differ ences in our assess ments of the role of the guidelines
We have discuss ed this and I have attemp ted to cl ar if y my point of view . I am very pleased with the level of support offer ed by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidel in es, which have been sub mitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes
This can only re in for ce the con cept based on a number of ele ments of good practice dra wn from our experience of the current 199 4 - 1999 programmes
I feel this a ug urs well for effective cooperation between our two institution s, at this time when programm ing for the period 2000 - 2 00 6 is being undert ak en, good joint working practice , which is, Mr H at z id ak is , back ed up by something I am very att en tive to : obs erv ance of the cod e of con du ct which link s our two institutions
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union
The next item is the debate on the report (A5- 01 0 7 /1999 ) by Mr B er end , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, on the six th period ic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [ S E C ( 99 ) 00 6 6 - C 5- 01 2 0 / 99 - 1999 /2 1 2 3 ( CO S ) ]
Mr President, Commissioner, this six th period ic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constit utes a m il est one in the analysis of regional d at a and high light s the progress made in this area since the issue of the f if th period ic report
I consider , however, that the mention of any real con ver g ence of a ver age regional development level s in Europe off ers a some wh at over -si mp li f ied view of the situation and, unfortun ately, this is often the m ess age taken up in the press and in some speech es
The Commission report gener ally re la tiv ises this obs erv ation, particularly when it ref ers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest , by which I mean the French over se as dep art ments and, more gener ally, the most rem ote regions
In this respect , I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism has adopted one of my amendments call ing on the Commission to dev ote a specific ch ap ter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most rem ote regions and, more specific ally, to consideration of the imp act of the measures short ly to be adopted under new Article 2 99 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam
Finally, in my view, this six th period ic report present s inter es ting argu ments from the view p oint of a real project for the bal an ced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it out l ines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more rem ote regions
E ven if the Commission is still re lu ct ant to say so in too exp lic it a f as h ion , its period ic report demonstr ates the urg ent need to promote po ly c entr ic development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initi ated by the S E C
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Social ists in this Parliament ag re es with the report that Mr B er end has just presented and congratul ates the author , both on the quality of his conclusion s and on his flex ibility , which ensure d that the different groups were able to incorpor ate amendments in committee
It must be re me mber ed that, current ly, the European Union' s over all competi tiveness is, in general term s, 8 1 % of that of the United States of Am er ic a and that this f ig ure will only improve if the f ig ure for our competi tive un it s, that is the regions, also impro ves . F urther more, this is at a time when techn ological development, economic global isation and our problem s, which are enlargement and the single currency , demand that the regions, as well as business es and individual s, make more of an effort to be competi tive
The European Commission' s six th report present s very val u able conclusion s
I shall su m m ar ise two of those high light ed by the rapporteur, one positive and one ne g ative
The first is that important adv an ces have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major , although not dec is ive , fact or in redu cing regional in equ al ities
The ne g ative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more effic ient in harmon ising the European regions ' G D P and produ c tiv ity than in harmon ising its level s of unemployment
It is therefore necessary to link structural finan cing more close ly to job cre ation
This , Commissioner, is the first comm and ment for the coming period
Th u s, Mr President, I ask my fe llow Members to appro ve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speak ers have done , to take good note of the conclusion s of their six th period ic report when they address the programm ing for the period 2000 - 2 00 6
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was deb ating it
The six th period ical report gi ves a basis for assess ing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aim s. The report show s that grow th has been une ven , despite all our efforts
V er y r ap id grow th is continu ing in C entral Europe. The strong est regional cent res also continue to grow fa ster than the general European a ver age , where as many s ou ther n European and n ort her n areas are develop ing consider ably more s low ly
We now require an in - d ep th analysis of why regional policy is not produ cing the des ire d result in all areas
Is the reason bureauc ra cy or is it because ins u fficient no tice has been taken of inter reg ional differ en ces, long dist an ces, c li m ates that are too co ld or too h ot , sp ar se popul ations and a ust ere conditions ?
How can the Union respon d to the chall eng es of global development in a way that the less develop ed areas can remain a part of that development ?
It is also important to disc over what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more rem ote areas
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility
S ome Member States have been in b re ach of the principle of subsidiarity and c ut national regional funds when regional aid coming v ia the Union has been increased
This has ch i pp ed away at the results that regional policy has produ ced
In the future , we must also develop indic at ors so that measures can be t ar get ed at the right time at the right place
For example, un con t ro ll ed m ig ration has not been given su fficient consideration
In this connection , too , we ight has to be given to the dec is ive importance of S M E s as employ ers and for ces behind regional development
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas develop ing more s low ly adopt the l ates t techn olog y and know - h ow
Our Group is in favour of adop ting this report
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has , until now , not been able to inter p ret , in any significant way , the existing differ ences in our in h ab it ants ' inc om es
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a g en u ine link between unemployment and po ver t y, as demonstr ated by the very wor ry ing fact that unemployment has reach ed, on a ver age , 2 3 . 7 % in the regions wor st affect ed, regions which also happen to be po or areas, wh il st in the 2 5 regions with the low est unemployment , cor res pon d ing to the r ich er areas, unemployment stand s at just 4 %
G i ven this situ ation, the report approved by Parliament must high light the need for measures that aim une qu iv oc ally to fight re lative po ver ty and unemployment : measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purp os es, which are often mis sp ent, with central ised state policies and the modern isation of te le c omm un ic ation and communication system s, with the particular aim of int e gra ting the least develop ed regions into the Trans - E uro pe an ra il N et work s, which are due in 200 7
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and cap ab ili ties of these countries ' agric ulture and fish eri es, which are often harm ed by the European Union' s own ins en si tive polic ies, as well as the prom o tion of active policies to create job s, particularly for women and y oun g people . On ly through the dec is ive application of this kind of measure will we be able to over come social and regional in equ ality , which is not the hist or ical product of in her ent def ect s but of mar gin al isation and economic policies which have had harm ful effects
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr B er end ' s report is precisely in line with the strategy deter min ed by the European Commission in as m uch as the question of increasing competi tiveness is brought right to the fore
The over ar ch ing objectives of the structural funds such as job cre ation, bo os ting equ ality of opportunity , increasing the sustain ability of employment and development, are only mentioned in pass ing
This at tit ud e appe ar s to me to be un j us tif i ed. I would also ask that a great deal more emphas is be pla ced on these points in the se vent h period ic report
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competi tiven ess, particularly as I myself am an ent re pr ene ur in an Objective 1 Reg ion , that is in B rand en b ur g in the F eder al Rep ublic of German y, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium -si zed enter p ris es
It is absolutely crucial that par al le l te mp or ary measures be introdu ced in the Objective 1 Reg ion s, that is to say job cre ation measure s, special programmes for supp or ting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business
They are support ed by appropriate European Union structural fund activities
S u pp or ting only the competi tiveness of companies will never be able to comp ens ate for the env is aged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a s el f- s u pp or ting up t urn in these Objective 1 Reg ion s
A fter all, the know ledge that economic development al one does not help to combat unemployment substan ti ates the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in g ross d om es tic product is needed to create any addition al jobs at all
Con c ent ra ting to the exc lusion of all else on supp ly and demand - or ient ated economic policy is not the answer
And those that do purs ue such a policy must invest in exp an sion for the most part and, to a less er ext ent, in r ational isation
It is imp er ative for this to go hand in hand with a demand - or ient ated economic policy if we are to have any ch ance at all of impro ving the social situation in these areas
The situation var ies to an en orm ous de g ree throughout the regions
In other words, what is needed is a number of acc om p an ying measures if any thing at all is to be acc om p lish ed there
For example, these would be measures for v oc ational tra in ing, for further e du c ation, for re - int e gra ting people who have already been exc lud ed from the produ ction proces s, for the flex ib il isation of working time and working time ar r ange ment s, in order to bring about a defin ite improve ment in the integration of person al and social aspect s and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again
Mr President, my comp li ments to the rapporteur for his in - d ep th report
The key go al of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union
B y sti m ul ating a di vers ity of invest ment s, the European Union is end e a vour ing to increase the G D P per cap it a and to bo ost employment
F rom the six th period ic report on the regions, one can draw the h es it ant conclusion that these inc en tives do not always have the des ire d effect
The efforts made in order to d ri ve up the G D P per cap it a in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase , not really a satis f ying result over a period during which, certainly over the past c ou p le of years, there has been economic grow th
As indic ated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measure s, on the other hand, are min im al as far as employment is concerned
S ome res erv ation about the effec tiveness of Community aid is therefore call ed for
Al so , the obs erv ation that the disp ar ities between regions within Member States some tim es even become more pr on oun ced ra ises serious questions
Mr President, it therefore seems worth wh ile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional author ities, especially in connection with bo os ting employment
It is, after all, they who have most know ledge about the regions which fall under their re mit
B y allow ing them to develop t ail or -m ade plans for the rele vant regions and, if necessary , t ying this in with financial aid , a high er ret urn can be achie ved
S ure ly this must be the u l tim ate go al
I am therefore in favour of the Commission de leg ating the practical detail s and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions
F o llow ing on from this, it is prob ably also more mean ing ful , with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say any way
B y sh if ting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems l ater on
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the C entral and East ern European countries
The report show s that, in general , they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of G D P per cap it a
With the plan n ed ac ces sion of a large number of these countries in the fore se e able future , it is a matter of urg ency to review the current structural policy
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to sub mit proposals for reform soon er rather than l ater
Mr President, Commissioner, following close sc ru tin y of this report one cannot es c a pe the conclusion that it was possible to fulf il the st ated objective of the structural policy only in part
For example, wh il st the disp ar ities between the regions have increased rather than dec re as ed, there has been a certain amount of con ver g ence between the Member States themselves in this respect
E qu ally, unemployment level s in the wor st affect ed regions b are ly fe ll at all, indeed they r ose in some cases
I w on der why it is that the structural funds are not employ ed more effici ently
E ven the acc um ul ation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has fail ed to have the des ire d effect in all regions and countries
S ince it is the dec la red aim of all poli ti ci ans throughout Europe to redu ce unemployment , then one must po se the cri tical question as to whether the policy employ ed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to bo ost the competi tiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improve ments in inf ra st ruct ure and ra ising the level of training
G en u ine structural reform s and a competition -f ri end ly tax ation policy are the cor ner st on es of a successful economic b ase
If we do not wish to stand acc us ed of purs u ing a cost - int ensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures dra wn up so far must be analys ed
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a su fficient number of jobs and when there is a significant redu ction in the unemployment r ate
Mr President, Commissioner, my than ks go to the rapporteur for hand ling this very important report, because develop ments in the social and economic situation will dec ide to what extent the citizens of Europe will jud ge that we have been successful in our work
This issue , which has an imp act on their every day life , is a key issue as regards EU cre di bility
It has to be conc ed ed that the EU has already aid ed, I would say quite m ag n ific ent ly, the development of po or countries
I re me mber what Portug al and G ree ce used to be like when I d ro ve through those countries for the first time tw ent y -f ive years ag o
In this connection , French speak ers would speak of a " c ou p de ch a pe au " : in other words, I take my h at off to the EU
The EU really des er ves such a g est ure , but differ ences between r ich and po or areas within countries are still too great
What is the result ?
Pe ople re act by voting with their fe et and go where they can ear n a c r ust
Con sequ ent ly, we have to build sch o ol s, h os p ital s, and the whole inf ra st ruct ure for the same people in the same country many tim es over
This is very cost ly and it also caus es very great social problems
M ost people , however, would like to live in the area in which they were b or n and ra is ed, if they were given the ch ance to , in other words, if there was work there
We must give them this opportunity
This is a mor al oblig ation the EU and all of us have
The solution , as I see it, li es in clearly encoura g ing ent re pr ene urs hip
B y ent re pr ene urs hip I do not simply mean the own ers hip of bus ines s, but creating will
I mean the at tit ud e where a person want s to get on in life , whether he or she is an employ ee , the own er of a business or an official
What is a fa ir soci ety ?
One in which some one from a mod est back g round can get on in life so as to make life a little e a si er for his or her ch ild r en
In this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the ch ance
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should le arn a less on from Am er ic a, where hard work is still in f as h ion and success is an indic ation of ab ility and not the ob ject of env y, as it often is here in Europe
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limit ed, I shall get st ra ight to the point
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact : the f ru it s of grow th are not dist rib ut ed equ it ably within the Union
The most rem ote regions, still hard h it by c at ast ro ph ic unemployment r ates , offer one example of this
In R e un ion , for example, the r ate is 3 7 %
This is not a situation rel ated to the economic c li m ate, how ever ; rather it is a structural problem , creat ed by our rem ot en ess, our ins ular ity , in short , our own specific person ality
The principle of specific , excep tion al treat ment was env is aged in Article 2 99 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases
It only remain s to put this principle into practice
The Commission document expect ed to be read y in De ce mber 1999 was delay ed until J an u ary , then F e b ru ary , and the initi al think ing does not f ill me with much op tim ism
I therefore appe al form ally to the Council and the Commission
As regards tax ation, state aid , the Structural Funds and def ending our tra dition al product s, practical measures ch ar ac ter ised by d ar ing and amb ition must be plan n ed as a matter of urg ency
If these do not materi al ise , then , unfortun ately, con ver g ence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be fe ared that the structural policy undert ak en in our regions, despite the si z e of the amount s comm itt ed, will end in fail ure
Thank you very much , Commissioner
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m
( T he sitting was cl osed at 8 . 2 5 p . m. )
A d op tion of the Min utes of the previous sitting
The Min utes of yesterday ' s sitting have been dist rib ut ed
A re there any comments ?
Mr President, I respon d to an inv it ation yesterday after n o on by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter refer red to in the Min utes
I refer to item 1 1 on the order of business
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Social ist Group yesterday about the re in st ate ment of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five - y ear strategic programme was su ffic i ently important for other speak ers who wish ed to comment brief ly on that matter to have been acc omm od ated
I wish to express that view even if I respect ful ly dis ag reed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Social ist Group
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wish ed to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speak ers rem ark ed yesterday , can only really have an effect if it work s in close cooperation and sy n erg y with the European Commission
We should also have the h um ility to recogn ise that, if we want ed to have a strategic debate acc om p an ied not just by a present ation and e lu cid ation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five - y ear programme, we should have the m ech an is ms in place more than just a week in adv ance of the debate in this House , so as to be able to discuss and con ve y in due time to the Commission what our wishes were
There is one basic less on I would like us to le arn from this
When there are major set - p ie ce deb ates sch ed ul ed between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our l ines on what are our m ut ual expect ations at least one full working month in adv ance
There needs first ly to be cl arity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission
We should not find ourselves l ate in the day in the unfortun ate position where the one or other institution cre ates an un n ecess ary fra ct ure in institution al relations hip s
L o ok ing at some of the press report s of last F ri day , I believe that the Commission and its President ex erc ised comm end able s el f- re st ra int in the way they comment ed public ly
That is something for which I have a de ep app re ci ation
I hope that we will le arn the less ons and not repe at this un n ecess ary ex erc ise which I believe was found ed on a mis app reh ension as to what was expect ed rather than any b ad fa ith on the part of either of the two institutions
It should not be dra m a tis ed into something more than that
Thank you very much , Mr C o x
I understand what you are saying
We have taken note of this
Mr President, concerning item 1 1 of the Min utes on the order of bus ines s, we ag reed yesterday to have the B our l ang es report on today 's agenda
However, it was with d ra wn from the Committee on B udget s last n ight without being discuss ed or voted on
It therefore needs to be with d ra wn from today 's agenda
Mr W y n n , that makes sense
The report is here b y with d ra wn from the agenda
Mr President, regarding Mrs L y n ne 's comments yesterday about health and safety in this build ing, I pres u me she was talking about the dra in s because there is a d read ful s me ll of dra in s on the f if th f lo or in the T ow er
This needs to be look ed into because it is clearly an indic ation that something is serious ly wr ong
I do not want to dra g up the issue of this build ing end less ly, but this is a serious problem
Mrs A her n , we have taken note of this
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the v enti l at ors on a particular f lo or , to the attention of the Q u a est or s, who are , in fact, responsible for the matter
We will also pass this on to our servic es, how ever
Thank you very much

R ef orm of European competition policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following report s :
A 5- 00 6 9 /1999 by Mr v on W og au , on behalf of the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affair s, on the Commission White Paper on modern isation of the rules implementing Artic les 8 5 and 8 6 of the E C Treaty [ CO M ( 1999 ) 1 01 - C 5- 01 0 5 /1999 - 1999 /2 1 0 8 ( CO S ) ] ;
A 5- 00 7 8 /1999 by Mr R ap k ay , on behalf of the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affair s, on the European Commission' s X X V I I I th Report on C om pe ti tion Polic y 1998 [ S E K ( 1999 ) 7 4 3 - C 5- 01 2 1 /1999 - 1999 /2 1 2 4 ( CO S ) ] ;
A 5- 00 8 7 /1999 by Mr J on ck he er, on behalf of the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affair s, on the se vent h sur ve y on state aid in the European Union in the manufact uring and certain other sector s. [ CO M ( 1999 ) 1 4 8 - C 5- 01 0 7 /1999 - 1999 /2 1 1 0 ( CO S ) ] ( R ep ort 199 5- 199 7 ) ;
A 5- 00 7 3 /1999 by Mr L ang en, on behalf of the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affair s, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission D ec ision No . 2 4 9 6 / 9 6 / E C S C of 1 8 De ce mber 199 6 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry ( S t eel A id C od e ) . [ CO M ( 1999 ) 9 4 - C 5- 01 0 4 /1999 - 1999 /2 1 0 7 ( CO S ) ]
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are en g aged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy
We are deb ating a high ly cont ro ver si al modern isation proposal for European mon op o lies law , that is Mr v on W og au ' s report, and it is far more cont ro ver si al than the vote in the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affairs may have given us reason to believe
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I person ally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wr ong and feel that it remain s to be seen as to whether we are t ru ly jus tif ied in using the term " m od ern isation " to des c rib e the cont ent of Artic les 8 1 and 8 2 of the White P ap er, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the exp ression " ret ro gra de step "
However, we are also discuss ing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate rel ates to the l at ter
But , of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper
It is all about the need for modern isation and the future vi ability of the European competition policy
On read ing both Commission document s, one le arn s that 1998 was the year in which the modern isation proposals introdu ced in 1997 were purs u ed and even parti ally comple t ed, which is something our own on go ing parliament ary work has t au ght us
A llow me to make two fundamental comments at this j un ct ure . As the compe t ent authority , the Commission, with its l og ic ally cons ist ent approach , has again and again s er ved the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the de light of the Member States or enter p ris es concerned
It should continue al ong this p ath
But , Commissioner, n one of this is to become less comp lic ated in future - one only has to think of the chall eng es pos ed by the enlargement of the Union, the de ep ening of the internal market , techn ological prog res s, global isation
Inde ed, it is not just about modern isation of Community law , more than any thing it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cas es, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decision s, for the European competition policy will be dep end ent on the population ' s accept ance, together with that of the political bod ies and enter p ris es concerned
On ly, without transparency there will be no accept ance, indeed there can be no modern isation without transparency
The competition report 1998 is not a b ad found ation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further impro ved upon
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now . Trans p ar ency and account ability be l ong together
I do not wish to call the dist rib ution of compe ten ces between the Commission and Parliament into question
The Commission is the ex ec u tive and Parliament o u ght to have no des ire what so ever to take on this role , for the s ake of its own independ ence ; but Parliament is a superv is ory bod y, and what better for um could there be in which to exp ound the reason ing behind one ' s decisions than a democratic ally - e lect ed Parliament, indeed an on go ing parliament ary discussion ?
H ere too we should continue al ong the p ath we have ch os en, strengthen ing and int en si f ying it
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though . Parliament is a legislative bod y, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consult ation in matters of competition law , of all thing s, is t ru ly sc and al ous
Therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introdu ce the cod ec ision procedure into legislation in this area
I expect the Commission to exp lo it every available opportunity for parliament ary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubt ful cas es, even given the Treaty stat us qu o
I also expect the Commission to be pro - ac tive in supp or ting us in our call for cod ec ision in legislative proced ures
This will be a good t est as to whether there is reason able cooperation between the two institutions
With all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not, however, an end in itself
C om pe ti tion is an instrument and does not always produ ce ide al solution s
At the end of the day , one of the fundamental t en et s of economic the ory is that the market is fail ing in many respect s and any one who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ide olog ue
C om pe ti tion should bring about bal ance in supp ly and demand and should provide for the op tim um dist rib ution of economic resources and fact s
But op tim um efficiency does not necess arily come about of its own accord
F ra me work conditions are ind is p ens able when it comes to pre ven ting ab us es, mon op o lies law being one example
But on the whole , this only s er ves to prevent ab us es ; framework conditions al one cannot achieve so cially leg iti m ate go als in is ol ation
C om pe ti tion y es, restric tions in state aid where necessary and where possible
However, since state aid for ms the l ion ' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like , regard less of Mr J on ck he er ' s report, to say one more thing about it. It is certainly possible , indeed it must be fe a sible for state aid to be given to small and medium -si zed enter p ris es involved in research and development for the purp ose of e du c ating them in regional and environmental policy
Inde ed it must be per m is sible for state aid to be provided for such purp os es, provided it does not lead to unacceptable dist or tion of competition
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in mon op o lies and m erg ers law for decisions to be compreh en sible
It is not just that we should p ill ory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of draw ing dis tin ctions and we must assess the different ty p es of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above -m ention ed objectives
My last comment was intend ed not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Party
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s An n ual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is author ised under Artic les 8 7 , 8 8 and 8 9 of the Trea ties
The Commission report is ess enti ally a des c ri p tive report detail ing the development of state aid in the manufact uring sector and certain other sector s, according to various ty p olog ies, such as the m eth od of finan cing and the objectives purs u ed
Let me refer you to the expl an atory statement for the qu an tit ative aspect s of the report and simply mention at this point that the ann ual level of state aid , on a ver age , for the period under review , is in the order of EUR 9 5 b illion , cor res pon d ing to a redu ction in the order of 1 3 % in relation to the period 199 3 - 199 5 , a redu ction which is ess enti ally due to a redu ction in aid in the F eder al Rep ublic of German y
To put it pl ain ly, the level of state aid dec la red , r ough ly spe aking , is gener ally st able during the period under discussion and comes to appro x im ately 1 . 2 % of Community G D P or more or less the equ i val ent, co in cid ent ally, of the Community budget for one year
This being the case, there are consider able disp ar ities between states , which may be measure d in various way s, such as , for example, as a per c ent age of add ed value and per w age ear ner
I think it is also inter es ting to add state aid and Community aid , which may be as si m il ated in some way into state aid
This clearly show s that it is the four countries which benefit from the C o hesion Fund , among other thing s, which come at the top of the list
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report
We not e, first of all, that the committee con sid ers the d at a, as presented in the Commission' s ann ual report, to be in too ag g reg ated a form to en able an in - d ep th e val u ation of state aid policy which is sim ult an e ous ly leg iti m ate, sen si tive to national interests and ext ensive in terms of comp li ance with the rules of competition , purs u ant to the act ual terms of the Treaty
The Commission can only co ll ate and analy se the d at a provided by the Member States
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the d at a provid ed, and our committee con sid ers that addition al efforts must be made in this respect
It is in this spirit that our parliament ary committee for example, has ch amp ion ed the long stand ing idea of a public reg ister of state aid , ac ces sible v ia the Intern et
Ha ving better , more detail ed information available , particularly with regard to the objectives purs u ed and the results rec ord ed, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to comm ission in a reg ular man ner stud ies of the social and economic e val u ation of national and regional state aid policies
And in so f ar as such stud ies already exist , to p ub lish more open ly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Trea ti es, which are not only to ensure the competi tiv ity of the European econom y, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion
B y stress ing, pri m ar i ly, the quality of the information provid ed, our debate in committee , and h ence the report which it is my hon our to present to you, avoid ed a simp l istic response in the form of an a prior i statement that the level of state aid was , in absolute term s, either too high or not high enough
M ost committee members have s ought rather to find a bal ance between , on the one hand, the need to see that both states and business es comp ly with the competition rules and, on the other hand, ac know ledge ment of the value of such aid with a view to contrib u ting to the objectives of the Treat y, particular ly, as I have said alread y, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion
This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur ' s initi al draft report were adopted in committee , particularly high li gh ting the need for effective re im b ur se ment of aid found to be i l leg al as well as the establish ment of a le ag ue t able of results
S e ven amendments have been ret abled for this pl en ary sitting
M ost of them are an exp ression of the political differ ences among ourselves regarding the appropri at en ess and effec tiveness of state aid , in view of the in ade qu a ci es, ac know led ged or not, of priv ate invest ment al one , the market fail ures or in ade qu a ci es of the market
There is in particular one amendment , let me point out , concerning the energy sector , which, in my cap ac ity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important
I should like to conclud e this present ation, Commissioner, by stress ing two things : first ly, a concern of the members of the committee and, second ly, a demand of our committee
The concern invol ves the pre - ac ces sion process for the countries of C entral and East ern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid
This is u nd ou b ted ly a comple x issue , and one where we should like to see the Commission inform ing us of the l ates t development in the matter , particularly in terms of the cap ac ity of the econom ies involved in the ac ces sion process to comp ly with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need , in all prob ability , to have specific rules on state aid used to assist rest ruct uring of their sect ors
And fin ally, in conclusion , our demand regarding the future respon sib ili ties of the European Parliament in the matters we are discuss ing, competition policy and state aid , in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference
As you know , Commissioner, our report ar g ues that the cod ec ision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid
Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today ' s debate concerns the steel aid cod e, that is the state aid in Europe grant ed in accordance with this cod e and which was assess ed by the Commission
There were a total of 2 7 cases in 1998 and the Commission sub mitted its own report on these
The E C S C Treaty is due to exp ire short ly
H ence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be man aged in future
The European Commission' s decision s, which fe at ure in the report, are wel com ed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cas es, th us apply ing Article 8 8 of the E C S C Treaty
The competi tiveness of the European steel industry also for ms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communic ation, which we have not yet deb ated in Parliament
As in other sector s, the general ban on state aid according to Article 8 7 ( 1 ) of the E C Treaty also appli es to the i ron and steel industry
A cc ord ing to this ar tic le , state aid is ir re con ci la ble with the common market , in principle
E x emp tions are only per mitted in precisely def ined cases
U nder Article 8 8 , the Commission is oblig ed to superv ise state aid
In 1998 , the l ar g est case concerned the supp ly of compan y capital tot all ing EUR 5 4 0 million to the P RE U S S A G in German y
F urther more, the Member States must give the Commission adv ance w ar ning with regard to their int en tions concerning state aid
The rules p ertain ing to the steel industry were dra wn up on 1 8 De ce mber 199 6
These sti pul ate that state aid can only be a ward ed to the steel industry in particular , precisely - de f ined cases i.e. those invol ving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection , social security to e ase the clos ure of steel wor ks and aid to help non- com pe ti tive enter p ris es c e ase tra d ing al t og ether
In addition , there is a special provision of up to EUR 5 0 million for G ree ce
However, there were obvious ly problems with the practical administration of the steel aid cod e over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to w ast e no time in get ting down to a debate on the regulations that are to suc ceed this state aid cod e once it has exp ire d
There must be no water ing - d own of the existing principles under ly ing the steel aid cod e
No one want s an un i mp ed ed subsid y competition in Europe
This would be to the consider able dis ad vant age of the internal market , regard less of the fact that the steel industry has under g one con so lid ation in the past few years
Con sequ ent ly, Parliament belie ves it is necessary for the steel aid cod e to be amend ed in the light of the industry ' s cla im s about une qu al treat ment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow - up regulations
We all know that so far the Council has dra gg ed its fe et with regard to follow - up regulations of this kind
The reason for this is that people are under the imp ression that once the steel aid cod e exp ire s, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inc on ven i ence of the European Commission' s superv ision
We therefore demand that once the Treaty exp ire s, steel aid must be regul ated by a Council regulation according to Article 9 4 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal val id ity and cl arity
This is the only way to en for ce the str ict ban on all aid not cover ed by the cod e
A Council regulation that is direct ly applic able law must also be obs er ved by the regional governments
What we need to avoid doing in the future is comprom ising competition conditions and dist ur b ing the bal ance in the market s
We also need to critic ise the Commission' s practice of appro ving mul ti p le aid p ack ag es for steel enter p ris es which in their view, do not fall within the c ateg or ies of the cod e, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this une qu al treat ment where certain individual decisions were concerned
The Commission will be call ed upon , in a report that has yet to be comp il ed for the year 1999 , to give a detail ed expl an ation of its active role in the e la b or ation of rest ruct uring plans and approved ex emp tion s, th us en abl ing a proper assess ment of the over all situation to be made
On ce the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affairs has adopted the draft report un an im ous ly with two ab st ention s, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves creat ed, in pl en ary sitting
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete
S ub sid ies, mon op o lies and b ar ri ers to competition are still imp ed ing market s and development a li ke
N ational governments provide subsid ies and prom ise that this is the last time, but then it happ ens again
S ub sid ies dist ort alloc ations, both within and between countries
A suc ces sive p has ing out of State aid is required , and more and more market s must be open ed up to competition . This appli es to those which have been turn ed into mon op o li es, both priv ate and public
Public mon op o lies are , more often than not, p has ed out re lu ct ant ly
In c re ased competition and new ly established organ is ations should be able to provide significant benefit s in terms of wel f are , including within the sp her es of e du c ation, health care and social services
Public mon op o lies must be rep la ced by competi tive struct ures
Europe must be modern is ed, made more ent re pr ene ur ial in spirit and ad ap ted in such a way that it bec om es a more competi tive environment for consum ers and companies
E ff ec tive competition p us hes pr ic es down and ra ises standards of living
It is precisely upon pr ice level s that consum er policy has fail ed to focus su ffic i ently . In fact, competition policy and consum er policy be l ong together
The internal market is the basis for our work
It s legislation is to apply equ ally to all, to large and small countries a li ke
A system atic sur ve y of the various national regulations is needed if b ar ri ers to competition are to be dis m ant l ed. The EU ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analys ed
The new mod el now being t est ed by the Commission o u ght not to lead to a process of national isation p ure and simp le which would under min e the established competition policy
In order to be effective , it must be well an ch ore d in the Member States ' national authorities
In six months ' time, it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the out come and also to look more close ly at the new situation ' s effects upon the Commission' s role
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been s ol ved through the idea of hold ing an inter -in s titutional cong ress which will open up an un b i ased debate adop ting a broad pers pe ctive and invol ving representatives of different interests
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to ret urn to the more r ad ical changes which have been discuss ed. There will also be the opportunity to find new common solution s and to analy se amendments from the committee debate
The law must be correct ly appli ed in matters of competition
W r ong ly appli ed competition policy may cause l os s es in the legal sp h ere and inter f ere with the right of own ers hip , which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for
We have a quite ex ci ting debate in f ron t of us
A con ference where the issues are proper ly deb ated will make it possible to st ra ight en out mis u nder stand ing s, at the same time as perhaps impro ving upon certain points
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens
In fact, in my own constit u ency of St ock h ol m , we have many good local examp les of increased supp ly and impro ved quality which have ar is en precisely because of exp os ure to competition in areas which were previous ly total mon op o lies
We would encoura ge a continu ation of the open debate which has been strengthen ed in the course of consideration of the report s by Mr v on W og au and Mr R ap k ay
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accord ed the importance which is only reason able in a state based on the r ule of law
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my m a id en speech here today, even though there has been a delay
I would like to begin by thank ing the rapporteur s Mr v on W og au , Mr L ang en, Mr R ap k ay and Mr J on ck he er, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation
C om pe ti tion is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success st ory ; take the energy and te le c omm un ic ations sector s, where there has been a demonst ra ble low er ing of pr ic es and improve ment in quality of service
All this is to the good of the consum er
But we have now ar ri ved at a point where we need to develop competition policy further
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this contain ing two key points : d ro pp ing the oblig ation to no tif y and ret ro d is p la ce ment of law en for ce ment
D ro pp ing the oblig ation to no tif y will mean less red t a pe and administration cost s, at any r ate
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more on us being pla ced on the individual in the business world , of course
It will no longer simply be a case of sub mit ting p ap ers and having them approved ; for one th ing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that is prob ably why there is une ase about this in other qu arter s
How ever I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a mark er for less red t a pe
The second point rel ates to the ret ro d is p la ce ment of law en for ce ment
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be appli ed not only by the Commission, by central bod ies, but also by national author ities, by national cour ts
We are not discuss ing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decid ed on c entr ally, it is precisely the ad ap t ation ph ase where we will experience a lack of legal certain ty
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anti cip ated legislative procedure that will en able enter p ris es to en j o y legal certain ty and to have rec our se to the Commission in this matter
The way to a European mon op o lies comm ission must be k ep t clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy
Parliament must have more involve ment and I also believe that if we were to introdu ce a reg ister in which we could as c ertain what state aid is being grant ed, then this would encoura ge the Member States to be more dis cip l ined
However, when it comes to what the future hold s for competition , there are two issues de ar to my hear t
One is subsidiarity
We all hold the view that competition is v ital to the economy and requ i res there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also per mit competition in the regions
C om pe ti tion between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weak en the European Union
I would c ite , by way of example, the issue of job cre ation sch em es, sa ving s ban ks and regional b ank s, and G ü t es ie ge l
H ere , a region has , by its own effort s, creat ed a means of mar ke ting its own product s
This own initiative must not be d est ro y ed by European inter vention
I believe there is also a need to ra ise the de min im is regulation
We should do every thing within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compe te with each other
My second point rel ates to discussion about competition and the social market econom y, although I am not going to talk about market fail ure just now
I have already refer red to the regional and sa ving s b ank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one hear s again and again in certain qu arter s
These day s, some one who li ves in an old people ' s home is acc omm od ated within the social field
However, I could also regard them as a c ust om er, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and time ly discussion on the way s in which the social field , that is e v ol ved structure s, sti f le competition
A p art from that, I could refer to any c ust om ers, any sector , as c ust om ers, and there b y have a high ly d est ru ctive effect on social field s
To conclud e, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . I believe it to be of v ital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to ra ise tax es, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to ac ross - the -b o ard regulation by Europe
Thank you very much , Mr R ad w an
I would like to congratulate you on what is refer red to in German parliament ary -s pe ak , in app ro pri ately in your case, as a m a id en speech
Mr President, Commissioner, I am spe aking on behalf of my fe llow Member , R o ber t Go e b b el s, who is un able to att end due to a political commitment
With in the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affair s, the J on ck he er report has given r ise to b it ter cont ro vers y on the subject of the oper ation of the market
A s li m right - w ing majority suc ceed ed in rem o ving any reference to market fail ures
E ven if the majority in this House were to ad h ere to this u l t r al i beral idea of a supp osed ly perf ect market , it would not make any differ ence to the real world
E conom ic relations hip s in the real world ad equ ately demonstr ate that e li min ating all public inter vention in the market does not in any way bring about perf ect competition and the op tim um dist rib ution of resources
Wh ile , since the d a wn of time, the market has been the key for um for human inter ch ange , it has never been perf ect
The market favour s the short term and immedi ate pro fit s
On the market , the bal ance of power between supp ly and demand are gener ally to the det ri ment of the weak est parti es, consum ers and work ers
In order to function , the market needs rules
The necessary and val u able spirit of initiative must be off se t by a sense of responsibility towards soci ety
We European Social ists are in favour of a market economy with a social purp ose
The market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic oper ator s, but public authorities must def ine the rules and objectives which en able the economy to develop in a sustainable f as h ion
Finally, aid can en able rest ruct uring , offer tra in ing, sa ve jobs and th us know - h ow
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to redu ce the over all level of aid
This aid must be a lig n ed with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research
The Commission must tra ck down the i l leg al aid and the aid which actually h ind ers the internal market
It would be a serious m ist ake to e li min ate all public aid
The Intern et is not a product of the market , but the result of research finan ced by the Am er ic an ar m y
The W or ld W ide We b , which has en abled the m et e or ic development of the information soci et y, was develop ed by C ER N in G ene v a, once again with public aid
The German Government ' s inter vention to sa ve the H ol z man n group was critic ised as an un j us tif i able con st ra int upon the market economy
President D u is en ber g even attemp ted to att rib ute the weak n ess, the entire ly re lative weak ness of the e uro in relation to the do ll ar to this state inter vention ism
I did not hear Mr D u is en ber g critic ising the inter vention of the Am er ic an mon etary authorities to sa ve the h ed ge fund , L T C M
W ish ing to sa ve 6 0 0 00 jobs is, app ar ent ly, a s in against the market , but sa ving capital does not seem to present any problem for the adv oc ates of the free market
Public mon ies are used in order to rep air the damage caus ed by international specul ation, as was the case in M e x ic o, A si a and B ra z il
H uman l ab our , on the other hand, is considered to be a simp le fact or in the equ ation
We Social ists reject the li ber als ' na ï ve op tim ism on this point
We want a true culture of competition in Europe
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regul ate the market and the Commission must act as jud ge
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thank ing Mr R ap k ay for a good report and con stru ctive cooperation
I want to thank you, Commissioner Mon ti , for your out stand ing cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new m ill en n ium , you have an especially important role . It is your job to t id y up the m ess left by national governments
These may well have g rand v ision s when it comes to competition policy, but their cap ac ity to w re ak ha v oc seems b ound less
Let me mention the l ates t examp les we have seen : H ol z man n , a compan y which recei ves consider able aid from the German Government ; sa w m ill s in form er East German y ; and, espe ci ally, aid to ship y ard s
These are three areas in which many D anish companies are experi en cing major problems and are being s qu ee zed out of their market s
I want to say to Mr P o os that I very much agree with Mr D u is en ber g that these examp les show that some EU Member States are not in a position to rest ruct ure their econom ies and, to that ext ent, are help ing to under min e the value of the e uro
The Group of the European Li beral , Dem ocrat and R ef orm Party has tabled 8 0 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and open n ess, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supp or ting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Li beral , Dem ocrat and R ef orm Party
As I say, our amendments concern transparency , and I should like to emphas ise the amendment which urg es the Commission to propose un if orm criteria and conditions for the type of state aid s we consider to be law ful , specifically in order to ensure that companies can pre d ict what their situation will be
A not her issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is dec la red un la w ful
How do we ensure that un la w ful state aid is pa id back ?
At present , there are no common rules in this area , and we v ig or ous ly urge the Commission to make a point of harmon ising the rules on rep ay ment
This is the way forward if we are to ensure un if orm conditions of competition
Finally, we propose keep ing both a reg ister , as mentioned by a number of my fe llow M E P s, and also a sc ore b o ard show ing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid
You have sh own us the way , Mr Mon ti , with the single market sc ore b o ard
It was this which ins p ire d us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Mon ti , will support these amendment s, and I look forward to your comments and to find ing out where you stand on this matter
To conclud e, I want to welcome the Commission' s X V I I I th Report on C om pe ti tion Polic y, on which, once again , a good deal of work has been done
But , as I have already mention ed, our over ri d ing objectives o u ght still to be those of transparency and open ness
There is still a need to t ight en up in the areas mention ed, and there is therefore good reason for continu ing to work res olute ly towards s ol ving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and open ness in the area of state aid
This is especially necessary in relation to the forth coming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr J on ck he er who , in his report, has considered very th or ough ly the problems as soci ated with enlargement and with ens uring that the applic ant countries are able to meet our criteri a, as well as with ens uring common conditions of competition
As Li ber als and G re en s, we clearly have different opinion s on how the world should look , but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives , and we shall tr y to find reason able solution s to our problems
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answer ed
A re state aid to business or inter - com p an y agreements leg iti m ate in a market econom y, and who must superv ise these excep tions to the absolute rules of the market economy ?
Reg ard ing the first point , we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has end ors ed, it is essential that, in some in stan ces, there is state aid to business es, be it in the form of tax ex emp tion s, special tax ation or even direct aid
It is also leg iti m ate for there to be inter - com p an y agreements and vol un t ary rest ra int agreement s, since all these agreements make it possible to redu ce the det ri ment al effects of competition on social or ec ological requirements
So our clear response is that, y es, such aid and such agreements are leg iti m ate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be express ly jus tif ied
The v on W og au report propos es refer ring superv ision of the leg iti m ac y of individual cases to national level
We feel this is re lative ly dang er ou s, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recogn ise that the Commission cannot do every thing
We demand that the gre ates t possible transparency should be in place and that greater po w ers of inves tig ation be grant ed to the Commission in order to chec k the leg iti m ac y of such excep tions after the fact
Mr President, once again we are deb ating the European Union' s competition policy
But let us st op to consider the circ um stan ces in which this debate is taking place and the conclusion s to which it should bring us
The over ri d ing fe at ures of today ' s economy are m as sive m erg ers and ac qu is i tions invol ving h uge companies with a market mon op o ly and the em erg ence of f ri ght ening ly power ful mul tin ational groups
S h ould we not be discuss ing this issue ?
We need a competition policy which can and will introdu ce control s on the activities of these priv ate - se ct or mon op o lies
C ertain sect ors of European industry , such as the ship b u ild ing industry , a ir transport and the steel industry , which have been hard h it by existing competition policy, have su ffer ed t re m end ous ly
They have lo st their stat u s, and a significant s lic e of the world market and h und red s of th ous and s of work ers have been made red und ant
When will we debate that ?
The sc and al ous concentr ation of power in sect ors of strategic importance is gi ving specul ative mul tin ational groups econom ies the si z e of entire states , and Member States of the Union at that
And yet , we keep on weak ening the public sector and we are read y and will ing to t ight en competition policy yet further by qu al if ying public pro c ure ment contra ct s pla ced with public - se ct or cor por ations as state aid
At the same time, unemployment is spir all ing as a result of the l os s of h und red s of th ous and s of jobs
W or k ers are fa cing a m as sive att ack on their employment and social rights
Con s um ers see their standard of living being e ro d ed, po ver ty sp read ing and the public sector and produ ction b ase in most countries in the Union being dis m ant led and dis s ol ved in the na me of un ad ul ter ated and c at ast ro ph ic competition , in the na me of the absolute market economy and the prom o tion of the mon op ol istic interests of b ig business
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are tot ally opp osed to it
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this p iv ot al year , prior to the change over to the single currency , the Commission has dep loy ed every effort to ensure the b ir th of the e uro in a fa v oura ble environment
The competition policy has , as far as these resources per m itt ed, contrib ut ed to this event
For our part , we remain sta un ch ly opp osed to the single currency which, far from bring ing us the adv ant ag es and flex ibility of a sh ared currency , imp ris ons us in an ar ti fic ial st ra it j ack et , which has been imp osed on the pe op les of Europe
Ha ving said that, govern ing means planning . It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been for ced upon us, competition law nat ur ally has an essential role to play
In this area , the Commission has given priority to a number of r out es of action : ac ting on the structure of market s by active ly comb ating anti - com pe ti tive prac tic es, by ref oc us ing its dep art ments ' superv is ory activities only upon matters with a man if est Community interest and by aff irm ing its intention to modern ise competition law
As regards state aid , it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more comple x , and the introdu ction of a public reg ister , where all aid would be rec ord ed, does not seem adv is able to us since this on erous commitment would quite nat ur ally run c oun ter to the attemp ts to simp li f y bureauc ra tic con st ra int s
Finally, on the subject of modern ising the implementation of Artic les 8 5 and 8 6 of the Treat y, we do not think that dec entral ised application would necess arily be going in the right dire ction
The Commission is, in fact, re tain ing not only the power to take matters out of the j ur is dic tion of national author ities, but clearly oblig ing the national j ur is dic tions to avoid disp u ting the decisions of the Commission at all
N ational states would th us become the sec ular ar m of the Commission regarding obs erv ance of the application of rules which they do not control
In conclusion , I would say that while some measures are he ad ing in the right dire ction , we shall of course remain v ig il ant in order to prevent the s now b all ing of F eder al ism which, if it were real is ed, would be to the det ri ment of Europe and the so ver e ign ty of the states
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basic ally positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition , particularly as regards the ab o li tion of the system of no ti fication and author is ation, but we are also p u z z led by several things
First of all, there is a risk that the dec entral isation of power s, though necessary in many way s, will cause an ab n orm al increase in competition - re l ated initiatives , and that some people will be te mp ted to use competition law , not as a means to be res ort ed to when all else fail s, of ens uring the sm o oth and pre d ict able function ing of the market s, but for the purp os es of as an instrument for economic and industri al policy, planning and inter ference with the nat ural work ings of the market s themselves , or even for protection ist purp os es
In this respect , we should he ed the words of v on E i ec k , and doubt less also those of the great It al ian li beral Br un o Le on i , who w arn ed precisely against the ris ks of an ab n orm al increase in anti - com pe ti tion policies
State inter ference in the economy is, even today, still to b la me for the most serious h ind r an ces pla ced in the way of the market , competition and freedom of ch o ice for European us ers and consum ers
There is State aid for business es - we have already discuss ed this, there is still a strong public pres ence in the economy - it is es tim ated that the It al ian T re as ur y control s 15 % of st ock exchange capital isation ; governments and central ban ks place ob st ac les in the way of m erg ers and ac qu is i tions ; and there has been much talk in recent wee ks about V od a f one ' s b id for M ann es man n and the b ail out of H ol z man n
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot for get that large sec tions of the economy are still firm ly in the hand s of the state , r ang ing from state te le vision , which is fund ed on a m and atory basis by the tax p ay er, and the P ost O ffic e, to some comp ul s ory ins ur ance sch em es, including health and social wel f are system s, which are man aged by in e fficient state mon op o lies which le ave no - one but the we alth y us er with any other op tion
Commissioner, I am quite fam ili ar with the con st ra int s imp osed by the Trea ti es, but I believe that, it must be emphas ised once again that the European economy is find ing it hard to compe te with the Am er ic an econom y, especially because of ins u ffic i ently open market s and a lack of g en u ine competition
What is being done may well be very important , but it is still not su fficient
Mr President, we are hold ing a special debate : on competition policy and state aid , the government ' s right and left hand, so to speak
Wh il st the E M U criteria are for cing Member States to c ur b exp end it ure , the high level of state aid to industry has so far remain ed in place
This is understand able , because it is high ly like ly that Member States which start to c ut back on state aid will cause companies to le ave , with ad ver se effects on employment
But , at the same time, this is not understand able because b ad management and non- v i able jobs should not be fund ed by tax p ay ers ' money
In principle , only h or i z on t al regulations are per m is sible because they do not dist ort , or hard ly dist ort , competition
The rapporteur ' s Amend ments N os 6 and 7 , therefore, des erve our support
Amend ments N os 1 and 5 make reference to the ph en omen on of market fail ure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ide al soci ety
V ul ner able people find themselves hard est h it
M ark et for ces must be employ ed in a s oph istic ated man ner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies
If this comes to nothing , then the government has to step in
The Commission' s White Paper on modern ising competition policy seems more like a discussion p aper
The ple a in favour of dec entral isation in order to light en the lo ad within the Dire ct or ate - G ener al on C om pe ti tion is a kind g est ure , but the way in which the Commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judic i ary being st ret ch ed
This would be at the exp en se of legal certain ty within industry
Do es the press ure of work within the Commission really dec re ase when national jud g es are required to report to the Commission ?
What is the Council ' s opinion on this and is the Commissioner prepared to completely recon sider these points ?
Mr President, a White P ap er, by defin ition , is not something you can take or le ave
It is there to gener ate re ac tions and the White Paper has certainly suc ceed ed in doing that
It for ms a s ound basis for discussion and is to be wel com ed in this sense
I understand where the auth ors are coming from and I share their views
I also ass u me that you, Commissioner, want to hon our the rep ut ation of , and the work put in by , your pre d ecess ors and that your offic es will purs ue the same objective
I cannot im ag ine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de - E uro pe an ise or re - n ational ise in a th or ough man n er, but I have my concerns and questions never thel ess
Firstly, these rel ate to the co her ence of the policy ' s application
In general , I am a great def ender of cultural di vers ity but not in terms of competi tiveness within the internal market
The internal market needs a un if orm competition policy, not only in terms of con cept , but also in terms of application
It is true , there are some European regulations and inter p ret ative state ments on the way
The Commission is also said to have the right of e v oc ation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities
But I still w on der if we do not run the risk of end ing up in a kind of E ch tern ach proces sion where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two step s forward
So , I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this un if orm application in practice and whether you your self consider the cour s es out l ined from point one h und red on wards in the White Paper to be fe a sible
Secondly, I understand the wor ry of industry regarding legal certain ty
M an y do s si ers are currently being f il ed with precisely this concern
This instrument will fall by the way side in future
In the White P ap er, you state that the Commission will still issue particular or d ers which can be used as guidel in es, but what will your criteria be for gr an ting such or d ers one day but not the next ?
Th ird ly, I would like to know whether the Commission has look ed into the effects its new approach will have on industri al strategy
I have particular concerns regarding the f ate of S M E s which will l ose part of their legal and financial protection , as is already the case, one has g ot to ad mit , within the new ver tical group ex emp tion for the dist rib ution sector
F our th ly, I would like to be inform ed of why the Commission does not ch o ose to apply the inv al id ity p en al ty in the case of e vid ent inf ring e ments of the competition rules
F if th ly, with the p ending enlargement , I w on der whether the c and id ate c oun ties will be able to play our g a me
They are still in tra in ing, as it were
What guarant ees do we have that they will grow into first -c l ass play ers in the le ag ue of the internal market ?
S i x th ly and last ly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on ver tical restric tion s, namely the legal priv ile ge of compan y law y ers
If the Commission imp le ments the White Paper objectives , it seems to me that discri mination within the internal market and between ex tern al and internal legal adv is ers will become more pr on oun ced and h ence even less accept able
Is the Commission consider ing taking any action to allow in - h ouse law y ers in all Member States legal priv ile ge ?
Commissioner, I am ask ing these questions as a def ender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense , we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain st eri le but can bear f ru it
Mr President, I would like , in begin ning my speech regarding the White P ap er, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr v on W og au
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Social ists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstr ated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure
We are , therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad out l ines of the White Paper
S ince the Treaty enter ed into force , Community law on competition has been one of the t en et s of Community policy
A fter al most for ty years of being in force , these rules were begin ning to show sign s of ex h a us tion
For this reason , modern isation was essential
That modern isation ca me to be particularly necessary for five reason s
Firstly, the author isation system ; second ly, dec entral ised application ; third ly, proced ural rules ; four th ly, judicial application ; and f if th ly and fin ally, ex ces sive red t a pe
The system of individual appro val s needed urg ent reform , as was un an im ous ly reques ted by special ised compan ies, ac ad em ic s and law y ers
I have not att end ed a single for um of special ists in competition law which has not reques ted a change to the system
A system , such as the current one , which is cap able of making so few decision s, be they appro val s or pro h ib ition s, is something less than a val id system
N ational competition authorities were able to apply Artic les 8 1 ( 1 ) and 8 2 for some time
However, they could not apply Article 8 1 ( 3 ) , which, to a certain ext ent, prevent ed the co her ent application of Article 8 1 ( 1 )
You will know that there are currently two pre li min ary issues before the Court of Justice , both brought by German cour t s, which question the fe a sibility of apply ing 8 1 ( 1 ) without being able to apply 8 1 ( 3 )
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary
The procedure in the field of competition is basic ally contain ed in Reg ul ation 1 7 6 2
The v o ic es in favour of its amendment were un an im ous
The fact that it did not establish a g en u ine procedure , that it did not establish time limit s, that it did not regul ate access for interest ed par ties to the f il es, or that the right to def ence was not proper ly recogn is ed, were fact ors which l ed to the un an im ous demand for reform
The Court of Justice ac cep ted some time ag o that Community competition law could be appli ed by the legal bod ies of the Member States and in 199 4 , the Commission p ub lish ed a communication on this subject
It was therefore necessary to fa cil it ate this approach
One of the most f re qu ent critic is ms of Community competition law is its ex ces sive red t a pe
As a consequ ence of the contin ent al legal tra dition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti - com pe ti tive or not dep end s more on an analysis of their cla us es than on their effects on the market
It was therefore necessary to introdu ce an economic analysis
The White Paper intend s to resol ve these problems and we therefore support these proposals
It is also true that we note certain de fic i en ci es which have come to light in the report
Am ong st these , first ly, is the fact that, despite tr ying to modern ise Artic les 8 1 and 8 2 , Article 8 1 and not Article 8 2 car ri es exc lu sive we ight . At the mom ent, with inter - com p an y agreements and the priv a tis ation of mon op o lies pres er ving d om in ant posi tions and even con so lid ating them , the comb ating of ab u sive con du ct is bec om ing particularly important
Secondly, Reg ul ation 1 7 6 2 must be repe al ed and rep la ced with a new regulation
For these reason s, we are going to vote in favour of the report
However, if some of the amendments are accept ed, particularly those presented by the P P E - D E Group , we would consider the report to be st ri pp ed of its value and to have become an inc ons ist ent document , lack ing in r ig our and, in that event , we would recon sider our support
Mr President, among st the various issues being deal t with in this joint debate , I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr B er eng u er, that is to say, the modern isation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper
Fr ank ly, I believe that this modern isation has been satis fact ory
Th rough his management , Commissioner Mon ti achie ves good result s, as did his pre d ecess or and, clear ly, he has established a guarantee which, in par al le l with the cre ation and development of the European internal market , has been cap able of establishing the cor res pon d ing cor re ctive measures so that the market economy within the Union may work ad equ ately, without the dist or tions which we econom ists know may ar ise when the market is enl ar g ed, as has happen ed in the European Union since 199 3
If it f un ctions well , if we are satis f i ed, if the Commission has basic ally act ed correct ly, why the need for the mod ific ation ?
V ar ious argu ments have been presented in its favour
Mr B er eng u er made a very acc ur ate analysis , jus tif ying the need and the rele vant reform s for impro ving the d y n am ic s of competition , but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be appli ed through the cor res pon d ing administ r ations in the Member States, are t ru ly i den tical in all regions
B ec ause , if this is not the case, we will be fa ced with the par ad o x that the Commission itself will introdu ce ele ments of un f air competition into the function ing of the European internal market
In that event we would not have mo ved forward , but rather back ward s, in the application of competition policy in the Union
Mr President, I would like first ly to express my app re ci ation to the Commission for the improve ment represent ed by the X X V I I I th report on competition policy in the Union, when comp ared to previous report s
I would also like to high light the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr R ap k ay , who has dis se ct ed this d en se and compreh ensive text in such a conc ise way
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the B as q ue C ount ry , which I represent - a mar gin for action , by v ir t ue of the principle of subsidiarity
N ever thel ess, I cannot for get the num erous critic ism s, both from Member States and from market oper ator s, which, given the broad mar gin for man o e u v re and disc re tion en j o y ed by the Commission in its e val u ation of specific cas es, maintain that they su ffer from legal in sec urity in the abs ence of clear rules allow ing interest ed par ties to anti cip ate the position of the authorities and there b y make fe a sible reques ts for aid aim ed at the prom o tion of economic activ ity and employment , the planning of compan y m erg ers e t c
The only guarantee has been to seek prior fa v oura ble appro val , through individual cas es, which will take more than six or e ight months to resol ve , an ex ces sive ly long period , which simply lead s to problems of a lack of flex ibility , aff ec ting the gener ation of we alth and employment
I therefore believe that something is mis s ing and I suggest that we establish more regul ations, l ay down clear rul es, which will benefit all of us : business pe ople , invest or s, work ers and the citizens in general
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an a ge of significant techn ological changes - just look at what is happen ing in the information techn olog y sector and other sect ors such as energy and transport - saf eg uard ing competition will be of fundamental importance for our future
F rom the point of view of economic grow th , and therefore of increasing employment and we alth , saf eg uard ing a competition policy in the Member States is bec om ing a crucial fact or , and one that is certainly very important for our future
This is why I give this report my full support
R ec ent ly, I have no tic ed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this princip al is respect ed in a proper and effective man n er, precisely in order to saf eg uard market flex ibility , both for product s and for services
I would emphas ise that this is going to be extremely important for our future , for Europe ' s econom y, and, above all, for the protection of our we alth and techn ological development in Europe in general
Mr President, for B ri tis h Con s erv atives the effic ient and un if orm application of European competition policy is at the c ore of achie ving an effective single market ac ross the whole of the European Union
It therefore follow s that any proposal which suggest s major reform of the m ach in er y for competition policy en for ce ment must be close ly and careful ly exam ined
The tr uth is that the single market is not yet complete
D uring my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become ac ute ly aware of the deter mination of many Members to d ri ve forward what is des c rib ed as the European project
We d a ily hear the need to promote a w ider and de ep er Europe
But all this, in effect , is so much r h et or ic when we look at the national , regional and local ob st ac les which continue to b l ock the oper ation of a true European single market
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission' s proposals
I should like to make it clear that we have the gre ates t confidence in and respect for Commissioner Mon ti
We look to him as the man to ro ot out car t els
But he would recogn ise that, as for every b od y else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to r ig or ous exam in ation
That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for E conom ic and Mon etary Affair s, Mr v on W og au
I want to congratulate him , s ad ly in his abs ence, for the th or ough and r ig or ous way in which he has undert ak en the prepar ation of his report - and also for put ting up with my being such a th or n in his s ide !
He mentioned ear li er that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support
So although I may not share his conclusion s, I believe he has i ll ust r ated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address
The first is the potential for r en ational isation of competition policy
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential ex ists
I remain wor ried about the cap ac ity of national cour ts and the cap ac ity of the national competition author ities. I remain wor ried about the whole oper ation of the judicial process
I asked Commissioner Mon ti the other day what happ ens if he pro ves to be wr ong and there is an effective r en ational isation
Mr v on W og au said we can look to the European Court
We ll , we in B rit ain are look ing to the European Court at the moment
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with inter im measures in a certain disp ute that we have with France at the mom ent, in which we have the support of the Commission
Un less any b od y think s that this is mere ly a national istic point , in the F act ort a me case, in which the B ri tis h Government was the def end ant , it to ok t en years for the European Court to give a rul ing
So , judic i ally, something needs to be done
I ask the Commission what can be done to spe ed up implementation in this particular area
In relation to legal certain t y, I end or se the point made by Mrs Th y s s en
It is important that business has legal certain ty
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Mon ti rec ently
He said we must not always be carried al ong by law y ers
I must dec la re an interest as a law y er but also as a form er competition min ister in the United K ing d om
We all have , as it were , our hist or ies to live with , but it is important that business has legal certain ty
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undert ak en of the imp lic ations of this change for business : a cost -b ene fit analysis of the s ort that is now bec om ing so much more European policy
I know there has been an analysis of the imp lic ations for the Commission of the change
We have been to ld how , current ly, people 's time is being w ast ed and that the chang es, therefore, could be bene fic ial
But I really feel that, in the circ um stan ces, we want to know what the imp lic ations would be for business
Finally, we , as B ri tis h Con s erv atives , are look ing for a change in dire ction , towards the development of an independent competition authority
I would like to hear what Commissioner Mon ti has to say about that
Mr President, the European Union' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration be gan
It is an integr al part of the t ension , in her ent in the very con cept of European integr ation, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more effic ient environment for the people and the econom y, and competition , which should provide inc en tives to improve the competi tiveness and future vi ability of the European Union as an en tit y
It is therefore with some jus ti fication that competition policy is one of the most important policies
We can be p rou d of a European competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality
We can be p rou d of mon op o lies and m erg ers superv ision
However, we must be v ig il ant in the face of global oper ator s, against wh om n ation - st ates are no longer able to imp ose limit s
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French w rit er V iv i en ne F ore s ti er, who des c rib ed the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s re ign of terr or
So ci ety is s urr ender ing itself to the economy
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union
We are aware that in this a ge of strategic all ian ces and m ill en n ium m erg ers - in 1998 U S D 2 4 00 b illion was pa id out in connection with take - over s - restric tive prac tic es are being held in chec k , not just by our own rules but also by b il ater al cooperation with the U S A or J ap an , or other s, until we get the international competition law we so b ad ly need
European competition policy, as we very often for get , is not just important for fa ir competition as such , but also for pr ic es, grow th and employment , and h ence for the public
In common with the other Member s, I call for Parliament to have cod ec ision rights where competition law is concerned
It is essential that this long over d ue step be taken
It is also important to under line the connection between competition policy and consum er protection
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Mon ti want s to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non- governmental organ isation s, consum er protection as soci ations and the public
G reat er transparency will also help to achieve public accept ance of decisions relating to competition policy
Th en it is possible to understand that, for example, low er elect ric ity and te le c omm un ic ations pr ic es are due to European competition policy, and Brus sels should not be p ill or ied when aid decisions are taken which are , of course, b ound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context
It is particularly important for there to be cl arity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement
E mp has is must also be pla ced on the fact that a state aid policy - and the J on ck he er report makes this very clear - must continue to aff ord each state the freedom to def ine and organ ise the tas ks of the public sector and own ers hip struct ures on an independent basis
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can s erve a use ful purp ose , with a view to off se t ting the de fic i en ci es of the market and further ing Community objectives
A word on the White Paper : the re vision of Artic les 8 1 and 8 2 represent s a change of dire ction in mon op o lies policy
I am opp osed to this, un li ke the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group , because I believe that, in competition policy term s, the direct ly applic able excep tion system is in every sense inf eri or to a system of pro h ib ition un less certain conditions are m et , and I believe there is a threat of r en ational isation
The system currently in force cre ates transparency , aff ord s enter p ris es legal certain ty and has , without a sh ad ow of a doubt , l ed to dis cip line and act ed as a deter r ent on account of the no ti fication require ment
The problem of over work high light ed by the Commission is not a su fficient reason for making r ad ical changes to the legal system
Inde ed, it is deb at able whether this could be carried through at all without amend ing the Treaty
Mr President, I am very g l ad that Mrs R and z i o - P l ath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speak er has done so
The ad vent of the e uro at the begin ning of last year un le as h ed en orm ous competi tive for ces within European business which are being m et by a m erg er w ave of quite un p re ced ent ed prop or tions
For example, the f ig ures for last year now show that the total value of m erg ers in the European area was EUR 1 . 4 t ri ll ion , which is se ven tim es the level of m erg er activ ity at the pe ak of the last European m erg er bo om in 199 0
This pos es en orm ous chall eng es for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those m erg ers are going to be design ed to prot ect pro fit mar gin s of the business es from competition rather than mere ly to en h ance produ c tiv ity and make those business es able to oper ate on a b ig g er sc al e
Commissioner Mon ti and his colleagues have a t re m end ous challenge a he ad of them and our wor ri es in the E L D R Group are that there should be no weak ening in the th r ust of competition policy either in the exam in ation of m erg ers or the monitoring of restric tive prac tic es
De leg ation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphas ise what Mr v on W og au said in his report on the need for reg ular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no s li pp age in the European e lement , and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reas s ure us that there would be r and om chec ks on that
Mr President, in the limited time I have , I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteur s and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here , in particular by Mr J on ck he er, who critic ised the ex ces sive g ather ing of information and the lack of transparency and soci o - ec on om ic bal ance in the gr an ting of aid
I also agree with the critic ism that no emphas is has been put on the implementation of Article 8 2 , especially when we are w it ness ing ab u sive con du ct in a context of market concentr ation
As a Member for the B as q ue C ount ry , I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fa ir competition in the market
I say this in case there is any doubt about the critic is ms which we have direct ed at the Commission in general , and Mr Mon ti , in particular , for its per sec ution of the inc en tives to B as q ue companies and the fact that it con sid ers them to be state aid
Our disc re p an cy st em s from the fact that the Commission contin ues to mis u nder stand the ch ar ac ter of the general system and the co - res pon sibility of our ar r ange ment which gi ves our B as q ue f is c al rules the same nature , found ation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are appli ed in a general way to all tax - p ay ers who , by v ir t ue of points which fall under an ex tern al system of law , are subject to those rules
Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exact ly what we need
We need competition if there is the least unemployment , for a sm o oth - r un ning health c are system , for social justice , for high social standard s, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve high est - qu ality product s, equal market access conditions for all enter p ris es, and environment ally -f ri end ly product s
In other words, we must suc ceed in link ing the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to man ag eri al economic s
I often have the imp ression , un li ke the country I come from - form er East German y - where economic competi tiveness is pri zed above all else and competi tiveness relating to man ag eri al economic s is dis reg ard ed, that very often the re ver se is the case ; soci ety think s al most exc lu sive ly in terms of man ag eri al economic s
I say that as an ent re pr ene ur who has a v est ed interest in this
But a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspect s go hand in hand
I will give you an example : the European Union was right to support the G r ö n it z steel wor ks in B rand en b ur g , although out of 5 0 00 jobs only 7 00 remain ed
But these are competi tive job s, for this steel wor ks is now the number two to ol steel manufactur er in the F eder al Rep ublic of German y
An y one who would j e op ard ise produ ction at this steel wor ks on principle , by demand ing the ret urn of the aid that was grant ed at the time, would not just place the steel wor ks itself in j e op ard y but also one of the region ' s employ ers that small and medium -si zed enter p ris es are , of course, dep end ent on too
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is design ed to achieve
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre - re qu is it es of man ag eri al economic s
Inde ed that is the only way to build up regional economic cir cul ation in the under - de velop ed regions that will prot ect people ' s social wel f are and bo ost pur ch as ing power
To that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand - or ient ated economic policy as opp osed to one focus ing he av ily on supp ly
Mr President, ever since I was elect ed to this Parliament in 199 4 I have never w it ness ed a report which had such anti - I r ish s enti ments and over t on es as the J on ck he er report which we are deb ating today
I would like to qu ote ver b a tim from the report : " S t ate aid per cap it a is high est in It al y, German y and Ireland . Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together . "
I believe that the rapporteur is simply play ing with f ig ures
I find it difficult to understand how he can inde x regional and social funds into this mat h em a tical equ ation
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has ag reed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 pl us
This was mere ly an ext ension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe
Regional disp ar ities must be over come if the internal market is to suc ceed and pro s per
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 4 0% and a top - up of 15 % for S M E s for f i x ed invest ment will be per mitted for companies set ting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post - 2 000
I remind Mr J on ck he er that I r ish companies or fore ign companies in Ireland still have to cross two se a m ass es to reach the main land European market p la ce
No other Member State is at such a dis ad vant age
Mr President, the mon op o lies ' ban is the key e lement of function ing competition order in Europe
The Commission de em ed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the mon op o lies ' ban to be un s a tis fact or y, something I would whole h ear ted ly agree with
But opinion di ff ers as to the solution
The Commission' s proposal does not form ally dev i ate from the mon op o lies ban but the up s h ot of this proposal is a tr an sition from a ban with per mit res erv ation to a per mit with ban res erv ation
In other words, we are making the tr an sition from the principle of ban ning to that of mis use
B oth I and other M E P s u t ter ly reject such a d r as tic change of system
I do not accept that a practical transp o sition problem should give r ise to chang ing the law
We would be chang ing the law to make it ex ec ut able again , which is something I consider to be unacceptable
The Commission is gi ving up its mon op o ly on ex emp tions
C om pe ti tion restric tions are to be a ut om atic ally ex emp ted against the back g round of this plan n ed system of legal ex emp tion , in so f ar as the provision s of Article 8 1 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union allow
The require ment to l od ge applic ations in Brus sels will be d ro pp ed ; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the d ark in future
This is unacceptable to my mind
The Commission' s programme is to be supp lement ed by en h an ced follow - up superv ision of the national authorities and Member States ' cour ts
But if this takes place in the course of r en ational isation then what we will have here is a p at ch work qu il t of competition policy
This is unacceptable in my view
It would weak en a key e lement of European policy
The change of system in European mon op o lies law that the European Commission is cont emp lating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned
There are enough other op tions in the present system to saf eg uard open market s and free competition
In any case, the Commission' s proposal ref ers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ag o as the f if ties and six ties
There was no majority for this at the time
S ince France la id a h uge amount of emphas is on legal ex emp tion at the time, it was dam aged by conc ession s in agric ult ural policy
F ort y years on , this proposal has again been pla ced on the t able and I am certain that it will create ro om for man o e u v re for the mon op o li es, to the det ri ment of Europe ' s consum ers
I consider this to be unacceptable
Mr President, in this important debate on competition , I am spe aking this mor ning with particular reference to Mr L ang en ' s document on the St eel A id C od e
As the Court of Justice recogn ised in 199 6 , the steel industry is particularly sen si tive to competition - re l ated dist ur ban ces
Inde ed, several years ag o, this was the conclusion of a report that I comp il ed on the strength s and weak ness es of the European steel sector
This is why it was jus tif i able to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ens uring the sur v i val of successful business es, even if this was in contra dic tion of Article 4 of the E C S C Treaty
This inde ed, is the aim of the six th St eel A id C od e, but at the same time it is important to avoid any inf ring e ment of the conditions of competition and any serious dist ur b ance of the market s, h ence the importance of regul ating such aid
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development, environmental protection and cases of compan y clos ure
In the same c ateg ory of ide as , it is essential that Member States fulf il their oblig ation to be account able to the Commission for the aid grant ed to their steel companies
The Commission suggest s short er de ad lin es. I agree with this request
Li ke the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, non eth el ess I dep l ore the fact that it does not cover all aspect s of the aid
Al though the St eel A id C od e is expressed in a very clear way , the Commission has author ised gr an ting steel companies aid which is not cover ed by the c ateg or ies sti pul ated by the C od e
In the interests of equ ality , either the C od e must be appli ed or it must be mod if ied
Finally, and in conclusion , Mr President, with the exp ir y of the E C S C Treat y, the regulations will have to be review ed since I think that the aid system will have to continue be y ond 200 2 , and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area
We therefore aw a it , and I aw a it , the European Commission' s proposals on this matter
Mr President, I am also going to refer to the report by Mr L ang en, which concerns aid to the steel industry
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, second ly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his critic ism of the fact that, despite the rules la id down in the six th St eel A id C od e, the Commission has f re qu ently author ised aid to companies which do not cor res pon d to the c ateg or ies in that C od e
However, the thing that wor ri es us most , Mr President, is the dec re ase in pr ic es, by 3 0% , o w ing to import s
The reason for this dec re ase is un f air competition from S ou th K ore a and T a i w an , in the case of steel , as a result of their different working conditions and conditions govern ing aid
O r d ers in the steel industry and the ship -b u ild ing industry - we also sp o ke about this a while ag o - have dec re ased d r as tic ally, res ul ting in a l os s of jobs
I live in a region where the ship -b u ild ing industry now has very serious problems : A st ur i as
With global market s, we need global employment law s and global subsid ies
I know this is difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fa ir employment law s for all work ers, here and else wh ere , and we do not sec ure equ it able subsid ies for all countries, here and else wh ere , it will be difficult to pres erve jobs in Europe and outside it
Mr President, Commissioner, Dire ct or - G ener al , I would particularly like to emphas ise the following in relation to the v on W og au report : I welcome the Commission' s open - min d ed end e a vour s to initi ate debate on the h ither t o str ict proced ural rul es, and to propose practical reform measures
I congratulate the rapporteur K ar l v on W og au , who takes up the the me but also makes quite pl ain his demand for cl ar ific ation, indic ates the acc om p an ying measures that need to be taken , and p ull s no p un ch es when it comes to the problems currently under discussion
The White Paper and the report are contribution s made at the begin ning of a necessary process of ref le ction , discussion , and reform which has yet to be conclud ed because there are still a few questions pos ed by ourselves , the judic i ary , the Member States, and above all the S M E s concerned, that need to be cl ar if ied
C om pe ti tion policy must continue to be accord ed central importance and will not be r en ational ised because this would j e op ard ise the internal market and Europe as a business loc ation in a global economy
However, it must be " e uro pe an ised " taking into account the principle of subsidiarity
I also welcome , therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the Commission gi ving up any of its responsibility
In practice , only 9 cases were reject ed, 9 4 % of the cases that the Commission had to process were not deal t with form ally but by means of un p ub lish ed, non- leg ally b ind ing administ ra tive communic ations or on account of the exp ir y of de ad lin es, which clearly show s that the work of the Commission is subject to time - re l at ed, sta ff ing and financial limit ations in this a ge of global isation and EU enlargement
To conclud e, I would like to tell you what I am ex pe c ting from this reform : fa ir competition and equal competition condition s, legal certain ty for all enter p ris es, cons ist ent application of competition policy, proced ural simp li fication according to the principle of the one - st op -s h op , coordin ation of the national - and to me , independent - competition author ities, close cooperation between the national authorities and cour ts and the Commission, al ong with a clear dist rib ution of compe ten ces between national authorities and cour ts in the application of European competition and mon op o lies law , and I expect the Commission to concentr ate on what is most crucial in the fulf il ment of its tas ks as the sup re me gu ard ian of the European competition policies
I am in su sp en se as to how the discussion s, which were broad ly bas ed, will be incorpor ated in the first legislative proposal
The Commission report conf ir ms that, with the excep tion of German y, state aid to business es is increasing
The Commission find s this wor ry ing only from the point of view of the conditions of competition
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working cl ass es
So ci ety g ain s nothing from these m as sive trans f ers of public funds to priv ate business
T ake , for example, the car manufact uring sector , where subsid ies and state aid of various s ort s have increased by 2 4 % during the reference period
With what aim ?
N ot to sa ve jobs
All these f ir ms have g one a he ad with job c ut s and even red und an ci es
N ot to improve working condition s, for in increasing produ ction with fe wer work ers, working conditions are made wor se
D id these f ir ms need state aid to sur v ive ?
No , car manufacturers have been making col os s al pro fit s for years
State aid is not only c oun ter p rodu ctive because , as the J on ck he er report ac know led g es, it gi ves r ise to subsid y h un ting with f ir ms rel oc ating from one country to another , but it is unacceptable because it alloc ates public mon ies to the en r ich ment of a hand ful of priv ate share ho ld ers
It is because the r ich est people are being fa v ou red every wh ere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being redu c ed, public services are being ab and on ed, h os p ital s are being cl osed
In voting against the J on ck he er report, I wish to ass er t the need for another policy, to w it , c e as ing all aid to priv ate f ir ms and u til ising the money there b y sa ved to develop public services and rec ru it sta ff
Mr President, today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has prob ably been the cor ner st one of the internal market
In accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented Artic les 8 5 to 9 4 , competition policy in the str ict sense , and the re vision of all state aid and tax provision s which may affect competition
Firstly, f is c al provision s of an ind ire ct nature and recent ly, than ks to Commissioner Mon ti , there have been direct provision s, the cod e of good con du ct in particular
This has work ed fa ir ly well , but, as in the fam ous f il m C as abl an c a ' ti me goes by ' and we must ad ap t the legislation we have been apply ing until now to the new circ um stan ces
In this respect I have obs er ved a significant cons ens us in all the inter ven tions
Firstly, it is necessary , in draw ing up the legisl ation, to produ ce clear and complete rules
It is prob ably h or r end ou s, especially in this particular ra ft of legisl ation, that there are conf us ed rul es, regul atory v ac u um s and rules that only l ay down u nd ef ined legal con cept s
This is all the wor se - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation li es with national authorities
Th ird ly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in res isting the te mp t ation to create independent ag en ci es which would dist ort the very ess ence of the Commission, in order to guarantee un if orm application by international bod ies
F our th ly, and last ly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has chang ed
We have seen this in the ab ort ed S e at t le Conference and we are now see ing it in the b il ater al con fer ences with different regions or countries of the world
The principle of competition must now be un i vers al in its application
We must monitor comp li ance with environmental standard s, employment standard s, in order to prevent d u mp ing in this area , and we must ensure sc ru pul ous respect for proper ty rights and the re vision of state aid , which in many industri es - as has already been said - dist ort s competition and d est ro y s jobs within our own terr itor y. To su m up , we should apply sim ilar conditions that will prevent aid , internal dist or tions by other countries, from being trans fer red to the international ar en a, in other words, through tr ick er y
Mr President, Commissioner Mon ti , there is much that is good in Mr J on ck he er ' s report on state aid for manufact uring industry and certain other sect ors
First of all the report re ve als Parliament' s single - min d ed deter mination to redu ce state aid to ensure that the internal market f un ctions fla w less ly
M an y of the report ' s conclusion s, however, are cause for concern , at least for our group
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid c al cul ated on a per cap it a basis v ary consider ably from Member State to Member State re ve als the need for sur ve y s such as this
A id that is based on the s el f- se e k ing amb i tions of a n ation gi ves companies un f air adv ant ag es, th us dist or ting competition and lead ing to an in e ff ec tive , un ec on om ic di vision of Europe ' s me ag re resources
The form the aid takes is important
F orm s of state aid that require an effort from the bene fic i ary are to be support ed
For example, state guarant e es, on which the Commission has just public ised its position , must nat ur ally be considered state aid , but they are , in my opinion, a better op tion than gr an ting aid direct ly to companies
The report on competition policy further stress es the Commission' s confidence in hard and fa st rules inst ead of put ting the emphas is on economic argu ments regarding efficiency , which affect s competi tiveness
The European economy will never achieve the level of competi tiveness des ire d if we do not show we tr ust in the market s
If competition policy is to be made sub ordin ate to the aim s of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic grow th will remain just a d ream
C om pe ti tion policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assess ed with reference to trade policy and non- m at eri al rights : we should not just be emphas ising its social di men sion
The aim s of social policy can be best real ised through strong er economic grow th , not by making comprom ises with regard to decisions on competition policy
Mr R ap k ay ' s report also emphas ises the importance of the international di men sion with regard to competition law
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve cons ens us at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law
A im ing inst ead at harmon ised min imum standards will e a si ly lead to a situation where we le ap over the low est h ur d le and end up with the low est common d en om in ator , which will water down all the aim s of competition policy
Mr President, Mr Mon ti , the reform of competition rules call s for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequ ence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward - lo ok ing view to the Union' s enlargement
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr v on W og au , for his commitment and I welcome his thought s
M ore over , I would like to say that I app re ci ate the rem ark s and obs erv ations that Pro f ess or T es a uro , Ch air man of the It al ian C om pe ti tion A uth ority , s ent me , and which I am sure Mr Mon ti will take into due account with a strong sense of co ll ab or ation
As things stand , there are consider able differ ences between them which come to the fore if we comp are the En g lish , It al ian and French market s. There is a large de g ree of state protection ism in the French market which is not found in the En g lish market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in It aly
A not her issue concerns the econom ies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remain ing assist ed econom ies for ever more if provision is not made for g ra du al ad j ust ment
In my opinion, we should also create a th res ho ld be low which two significant comp on ents which ch ar ac ter ise our economic structure should be pla ced : small and medium -si zed business es, which b ind the European economy together , and social protection , which Europe has always guarant e ed to the weak est part s of the economy
S a f eg uard ing the social function of the market is what makes the differ ence between free trade , p ure and simp le , and a system for impro ving people ' s quality of life
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the out er most regions and is land s, all of which must be prot ect ed
We o u ght therefore to consider creating two foc al points of an ex tern al market by ins tig ating pro fit able relations with R us si a and the M ed iter r an e an countries, precisely so that their econom ies become less peri p her al
I hope - and I thank Mr Mon ti for this - that the new rules will ref lect as many aspect s of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guarant e ed
Mr President, competition is at the hear t of the European internal market policy and is also its d ri ving force
A free and open market can only exist by the g ra ce of competition , mark ed by clear , un if orm rules
In his report, K ar l v on W og au man ag es to cap t ure this very well
But Europe is chang ing
The econom ies are grow ing, we are enl ar g ing to 2 5- 3 0 Member States
The European Commission will become over b ur den ed if it purs ues its current policy
It is therefore necessary to modern ise competition policy
This is not in question
Ha ving said this, I still have concerns about the proposed dec entral isation
How will the Commission, as k ee per of the Trea ti es, guarantee that decisions are taken un if orm ly in matters of competition in L ond on , Pal er m o, H els ink i and, soon , B ud ap est and An k ar a ?
This is necessary if legal in equ ality is to be prevent ed, and issues of competition will g ra v it ate towards the cour t where the most l en ient jud ge ments are given
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 4 0 years ' worth of experience
In the N ether land s, the competition authority is still in its inf an cy
This country has a very small market which, unfortun ately, is often at the same time def ined as the rele vant market
This in contra st to German y, where a very experi en ced K ar te ll am t is ex erc ising its po w ers within a g ig an tic market
The European Commission' s belie f that, in all qu arter s of the Union, legislation will , al most as a matter of course, be inter p re ted in the same way , is what , within c ath olic circ l es, we term " f o ol h ard y, " and this is not allow ed
Un if orm ity needs to be work ed on
Th ink of special ist , national cour ts with the op tion of direct appe al to a special competition cour t at the European Court
This special cour t in L u x em bour g is necessary in order to build up broad exper ti se
M ore over , due to the im men se economic and social interests invol v ed, we cannot aff ord to w a it for a jud ge ment to be pr on oun ced two years after the event , as is now quite n orm al
What is the Commissioner ' s opinion of this ?
I would like to fin ish off by making an important point for small and medium -si zed business es
In order to grant small and medium -si zed companies greater security , the European Commission itself needs to draw up an ex emp tion regulation for small and medium -si zed business es so that, al ong side ver tical ex emp tion s, h or i z on t al ex emp tions will also be possible
Th rough cooper ation, small , independent f ir ms must be able to stand up to the large ch ain s
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life imp os sible for small business es
M ore over , regarding these small business es, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior w ar ning bu il t in , the y e llow card , inst ead of an immedi ate red card , which will be a large fin e and will threat en the compan y ' s very exist ence
Mr President, being the last to speak gi ves me the priv ile ge , Commissioner, of tell ing you that the majority of this House support s your initiative and has expressed a total , and, I believe , jus tif i ed, confidence in you at the hel m of this bo at
But we all want to be o ar s men on it. We all be l ong on the same bo at and want to r ow with you
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an inter in s titutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the fin ish ing to uch es to this essential reform
The many ide as which have been expressed here could be put into three broad c ateg or ies
Firstly, there is the concern that some have express ed, in particular Mrs R and z i o - P l ath , President of the Committee on E conom ic Affair s, of whether this new system of legal excep tion is absolutely comp a ti ble with the Treaty
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be address ed
Secondly, we have the issue of companies ' legal certain ty
It is true , Commissioner, that the Commission is not a m ach ine for manufact uring legal certain ty
We all agree on this
But it is non eth el ess true - and this has been repe ated from all sec tions of this House - that the European industri al fa b ric is comp osed of small and medium -si zed business es, and that the Commission often play s the role of a u ct or it as , of leg iti m ising the nature of the internal market
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr K ar as said
There have only been n ine re jec tions
But here I would like to call on my experience as a law y er
How often has a law y er with two companies and one project , in the face of a Commission guidel ine given ex an te , chang ed that project in order for it to comp ly with the competition rules !
This is therefore an aspect to be considered
Th ird ly, we have the problem of the un if orm application of Community law
In this respect , the excellent speech by Mrs Th y s s en cannot be impro ved upon
I believe that b i od i vers ity is good , as is cultural di vers ity , but not di vers ity in the application of the law with regard to the essential c ore of the internal market , that is to say, competition law
H ere improve ments should be made
On ly in certain countries, German y for example, is there special ised j ur is dic tion
P er haps this is a prom ising a ven ue to expl ore , but we must also expl ore others
What we cannot do , Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way , and give am m un ition , to those who regard the European institutions as the proper ty of the great and the good , of the r ich , and not of the citizen , or the small and medium bus ines s, which, in the wor st case sc en ar i o - which will never become reality because the requ is ite measures will be appli ed to prevent it - will result in cour ts which make disp ar ate jud ge ment s, very l ate, with no real possibility of control ap art from what the French call " le par c our s d u combat ant " , that is to say, after L ord know s how many years, when the Court in L u x em bour g pass es jud ge ment , a Court which we know to be in und ated at the moment
Commissioner, it is imp os sible to over st ate the importance of this reform
It trans c end s competition , it trans c end s the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it prof ound ly affect s the mean ing of European integr ation, the mean ing of the leg iti m ac y of European integration
Therefore , Commissioner, we are re ly ing on this inter in s titutional dialogue to put the fin ish ing to uch es to a reform which we are all h op ing for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your dire ction and with our cooperation
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hear ti ly congratulate the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest sh own in competition - re l ated subject s
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bear s this out
We have he ard some very th or ough obs erv ations which both concern the ph il os oph y of economic policy and are important for the institution al order
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a p ill ar of the social market economy and of European con struction
The guid ing th read run ning through all the aspect s of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together , aim s to ensure more effective protection of competition , redu ce the bureauc ra tic b ur den we igh ing down business es and take decision -m aking process es clos er to the European people
I , person ally, would s in c ere ly like to thank Mr v on W og au for his commitment in exam ining the do s si er on the White Paper and for the quality of his report
I would like to di vid e the consider ations raised during this debate on the v on W og au report into four group s. I do not consider these consider ations to be critic is ms of the Commission, but, on the cont r ary , fundamental contribution s, since jus tif ied concerns have been expressed that we both want to over come
The groups are : the efficiency of the rul es, the risk of r en ational is ation, cons ist ent application of the rules and legal certain t y. I will take these very quickly one at a time
E ffic i ency : I am conv in ced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weak en it
The current no ti fication instrument , ladies and gentlemen, no longer allow s us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is proper ly inform ed about the most serious restric tions - I would remind you that, in 3 5 years, there have only been n ine cases in which the Commission has decid ed on pro h ib ition following no ti fication in the abs ence of a comp l ain t - n or does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certain ty for business es which, in the majority of cas es, rece ive a simp le com fort let ter
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition , pri m arily because it will allow the Commission to concentr ate its action on the most serious restric tion s, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater de g ree in st amp ing out inf ring e ment s, and last ly in that it will allow vic ti ms of inf ring e ments to have direct rec our se to national jud g es, whose m ission is to prot ect the rights of individual s
The question of r en ational isation : first of all, although it is not really necessary , I would like to point out and st res s, several tim es if I may , that the White Paper does not affect m erg ers or State aid in the s light est - we are not look ing for dev olution in these areas - but that, as far as Reg ul ation 1 7 is concerned, there is a risk of r en ational isation
Of course we have p on der ed this issue , and we are still stud ying it extremely careful ly, and this is also than ks to the concerns you have v o ic ed
At the end of the day , I hon est ly do not believe that this fear is jus tif ied
The Commission proposal accord s the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy
The reform does not ent ail any redu ction in the Commission' s activ ities, but requ i res them to focus on the most important do s si ers
The reform will lead to a g ra du al development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term , used by Mrs R and z i o - P l ath , and, more over , I fully agree with it - of European competition culture
So , the reform will lead to the various national competition cult ures being transp l ant ed and taking ro ot in the European competition culture - where today various small pl ants th ri ve , and they are certainly not all the same
The f i ft een set s of national provision s will g ra du ally be ab and on ed, per mit ting greater use of Community law , which a high er number of prot ag on ists will be able to apply
A llow me to emphas ise that this is commun iti s ation, not r en ational is ation, of competition law
The question of cons ist ent application : the risk of inc ons ist ent application of competition rules must be b or ne in mind , but I do not believe that it should be ex ag g er ated
As with many other provision s of the Treat y, Artic les 8 1 ( 1 ) and 8 2 have , after all, been appli ed for dec ad es by national authorities and jud g es, and I do not feel that this has creat ed serious problems
In a direct ly applic able excep tion system , cons ist ency will dep end first ly on the de g ree of cl arity of the materi al rules
The Commission will make every effort to def ine the legislative framework , both through general provision s and through its decision -m aking practice
Secondly, we will need to set effic ient m ech an is ms in place to prevent disp ut es, and the White Paper set s out m ech an is ms for information and consult ation
In this respect , I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs R i is - J ø r g ens en and Mr H u h ne of monitoring implementation
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will prob ably take up
Th ough we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is e vid ent that we will w at ch very careful ly how E C law is appli ed by national authorities and cour ts
That is why the Commission want s to keep the right to with d ra w a case from a national competition authority in the event of incor rect application
This goes at least some way towards al le v i ating your concern s, Mrs Pe i j s
Con c ern ing Mr E v ans ' point regarding the imp lic ations for business es, it is important that the cost -b ene fit analysis should be serious ly con du ct ed
The purp ose of p ub lish ing the White Paper is, after all, to colle ct comments from business es as well as from other sour ces
We have received many excellent obs erv ations and contribution s which give us the materi al to make a cost -b ene fit assess ment for business
We will exam ine all that materi al careful ly before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation
There is one point about the imp act for f ir ms which is of great importance . This was raised by Mrs Th y s s en, Mrs Pe i j s and Mrs Pal a ci o V al le l ers und i : the issue of S M E s
M an y speak ers have under l ined this
The Commission is pay ing particular attention to legal certain ty for S M E s
We are propos ing a system which consider ably impro ves legal certain ty for S M E s
Wh y ?
Is this simply a political g est ure ?
No
In the system we propose reform ing our substan tive rules in such a way that most S M E s will be cover ed by b l ock ex emp tion regul ations, as in the field of ver tical rest ra int s
M ost S M E s have in fact less than 3 0% of the market share
We have a de min im is no tice which contain s a dec l ar ation that since S M E s are not involved in market d om in ance they are not n orm ally subject to the str ict pro h ib ition under Article 8 1 ( 1 )
We are working on further b l ock ex emp tions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of S M E s, and our White Paper on modern isation will also improve the situation of S M E s, first by e li min ating the bureauc ra cy res ul ting from the present no ti fication system , and second ly, by making Article 8 1 ( 3 ) direct ly applic able , which will benefit S M E s in particular
The four th group is legal certain t y. Mr E v an s, legal certain ty is, of course - and I am the first to ac know ledge this - important for business es, not just for the legal prof ession s, although the l at ter do play an extremely important role in the con struction of Europe
L eg al certain ty is important for business es : this is a subject , the importance of which the Ch air of the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et , Mrs Pal a ci o V al le l ers und i , emphas ised in her last inter vention - and I am very gr ate ful to her for the way she always takes the w id est interest in subject s regarding the single market , includ ing, in this case, competition
I am conv in ced that this proposal will increase legal certain ty for business es for three reason s : by v ir t ue of the direct effect of Article 8 1 ( 3 ) , it will per mit author is ation, without a prior decision , of all restric tive competition agreements which meet the ex emp tion conditions ; it will create the opportunity to help business es in the event of doub ts over inter p ret ation through the public ation of reason ed opinion s ; it will be acc om p an ied by ex emp tion regulations and guidelines which will cl ar if y the rules and ensure certain ty
( F R ) Mrs Th y s s en also refer red to the matter of legal priv ile ge for compan y law y ers
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pr on oun ced a rul ing on this in 1 9 8 2 , as you know better than I . This rul ing remain s val id and there is nothing to jus tif y any recon sider ation there o f
The White Paper requ i res only a single aspect of the issue to be re - e x am ined : the exchange of confid ential information
The guarant ees which companies must be given are currently under discussion
( I T ) I shall now quickly turn , Mr President, to Mr R ap k ay ' s report, and I would like to thank him s in c ere ly for the quality of his work and for the broad end or se ment given to the Commission' s X X V I I I th An n ual Report on C om pe ti tion Polic y
We share the same basic views but the R ap k ay report l ay s emphas is on several points that we shall need to consider very careful ly
I will mention only two , in order to be brief
The first is greater transparency
Parliament know s how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hear ing, on 1 S ep t ember , in the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affairs
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm , Mr R ap k ay , that the Commission is will ing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject , to which Mrs R and z i o - P l ath has also dra wn our attention
We have very satis fact ory b il ater al relations with the rele vant Am er ic an , C an ad ian and J ap an ese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treat ed as a s ep ar ate top ic within the W or ld T ra de O r gan isation
Mr J on ck he er, I would like to thank you just as w arm ly for your report on the se vent h sur ve y on State aid in the European Union
I will not talk about cod ec ision here , but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important
It has major institution al imp lic ations which obvious ly go be y ond the specific area of competition ; I am therefore not qu al if ied to give an opinion, and this is obvious ly a matter for the broad er context of the Intergovernmental Conference
With regard to your sugg es tion s, Mr J on ck he er, you already know that my sta ff , who , although short - h and ed as us ual , are for t un ately high ly qu al if i ed, are working hard to produ ce the reg ister of State aid s and the State aid s ' s c ore b o ard '
I am aw a iting with great interest the results of the e igh th sur ve y, which, according to the sch ed ul ed time f ra me , should be being dra wn up by the sta ff now , in J an u ary , and for adop tion by the Commission in Mar ch 2000 , to see whether the l ates t tr end s are confirm ed
Mr J on ck he er, Mrs Th y s s en and Mr G e me ll i raised the issue of the state of prepar ation of the c and id ate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid
I can only say very brief ly, that we are active ly working with them on a practical level : they are making prepar ations, they now all have competition law s and are set ting up the rele vant authorities
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know , I share - that we are conclud ing the review of the organ isation of environmental State aid
In connection with the issue of State aid , I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs R i is - J ø r g ens en, among others regarding rep ay ment of i l leg al aid
In A pri l 1999 , the Commission adopted new R ul es of Pro ced ure which introdu ced specific rules on rep ay ment
In the ne ar future - and I can ass ure you of this - you will see just how serious ly we mean to take these rules
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr L ang en w arm ly for his report, which, although g e ared more towards a specific sector , is a val u able contribution
I would like to say that, as we know , the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the excep tion procedure , purs u ant to Article 9 5 of the E C S C Treat y, but address es decisions which are not cover ed by the cod e on aid for the steel sector
In respect of future provision s on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in J u ly 200 2 , we will ensure that str ict dis cip line contin ues to be appli ed, and the industry itself now ag re es on the need for this
When we have final ised our proposal on the new rules and decid ed on the most su it able legal form , I will be happ y to present our view p oint to you
So , Mr President, I will w alk away from this debate , for which I am very gr ate ful to Parliament, in the know ledge that we have the European Parliament' s int el lect ual and political support , which appe ar s to come from all s id es of the House , for competition policy, its basic app re ci ation for the work the Commission is carry ing out and its confidence in our ab ility to continue to deli ver in the future
I am especially gr ate ful for all of this. We will continue the inter in s titutional dialogue open ed with the Committee for E conom ic and Mon etary Affair s, and, at a more general level , with Parliament
In this regard , I li k ed your term , Mrs Pal a ci o V al le l ers und i : we must all p ull together , pre fer ably in the same dire ction
C om pe ti tion is not an end in itself , as Mr R ap k ay right ly point ed out , but it play s an extremely important role in European integration
As Mr v on W og au said at the start of the debate , at the end of the day competition is not an ab st ra ct con cept : it is in the public interest and for ms the basis of the social market economy
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a val u able social , as well as economic , role in the European integration proces s, as it has done in the past
Thank you, Commissioner Mon ti
The joint debate is cl osed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m
Pro t ection under criminal law of the Union 's financial interests
The next item is the report (A5- 000 2 /2 000 ) by Mrs The at o, on behalf of the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol , contain ing Parliament' s recommend ations to the Commission on introdu cing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests
Mr President, year after year we le arn , main ly from the European Court of A ud it ors ' t est report s, that money is lo st to the budget of the European Union on account of mis de me an our s r ang ing from w ast age , m ism an age ment , and ir reg ular ities to su s pect ed b l at ant fraud
For some time now , these ab us es have me ant that Parliament has been call ed upon to initi ate measures that should s erve to prot ect the European tax p ay er ' s mone y, which, when all is said and done , is what sustain s the Union' s budget
Par ticular attention in this respect should be given to comb ating fraud , to det ec ting it, p un ish ing those gu il ty of it and pre ven ting it from happen ing
C re ating U C LAF by means of the T as k For ce and set ting up the anti -f ra ud offic e OLAF were important step s, as was the regulation on prot ec ting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring
The Union can only imp ose s an ctions in the field p ertain ing to administ ra tive law when cases are exp osed
So far , efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for impro per ly ob tain ed money to be ret urn ed only had limited success
It is for the Member States to undert ake criminal measures
S ince there is often over la p between the two legal an g les and cross-border vi ol ations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also comm itted by those involved in organ ised crime - it is un c lear as to where the responsibility li es among st the Member States
Th en there are differ ences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with prot ra ct ed or even un ful f ill ed reques ts for m ut ual assistance in law en for ce ment
What is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two sub sequ ent prot oc ol s sign ed by the European Council in 199 5 did nothing to change this
For it to enter into force , it must be ra tif ied by all 15 Member States
A fter five years only four have done so
This state of de ad l ock , which threat ens to under min e the cre di bility of the Union, has ins p ire d Parliament to initi ate the set ting - up of a European Public Pro secutor ' s O ffice
There is no intention what so ever to create a trans n ational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim is to equ ip the Union with specific instru ments for the protection of its financial interest s, that is wh il st up ho ld ing the principle of subsidiarity
We are gi ving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will en able this go al to be real ised
The concerns of the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et , as ar tic ul ated in its position , together with those of the Committee on C itiz ens ' F reedom s and Right s, Justice and H ome Affair s, will also be taken full account of in this process
We would like to make two recommend ations ar ising from the establish ment of OLAF and which should saf eg uard its oper ational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individual s
In addition , we need - and this is my first recommend ation - a legislative act that includ es those off ences which are to the det ri ment of the Union' s financial interest s, and in which main principles are firm ly established
I support the proposed de ad line for the Commission being 3 0 S ep t ember in a proposed amendment
The second recommend ation rel ates to criminal proceed ings
The Commission o u ght - and I have also amend ed this de ad line to 3 1 M ay 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establish ment of an independent bod y which has institution al link s with the Commission, for coordin ating and superv ising the legal inves tig ative bod y OLAF
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independ ence of the Dire ct or of the ag ency
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent stat ute for this bod y and def ine its task s, which are conf ined to in qu i ri es and criminal pro sec ution undert ak en by OLAF into activities which are to the det ri ment of the Union' s financial interest s, and to OLAF ' s relations hip with the national authorities
There is no question of this inf lu en cing the administration of justice in the Member States
The Court of Justice is to monitor the leg ality of the legislative act s
In addition , we call upon the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establish ment of a European Public Pro secutor ' s O ffice for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now w ide ly recogn ised stud y comp il ed by well - know n exper t s, the so -c all ed cor p us j ur is , and of the fe a sibility stud ies that have sub sequ ently appe ared
F urther support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so -c all ed F ive W ise M en
The Commission, Mr B arn i er, Mr V itor in o and several Member States are equ ally re cep tive to the idea
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol adopted with a large majority
We can set another example here , to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent m ism an age ment and in particular , fraud , and to m et e out p un ish ment where necessary
Mr President, I am happ y to take the f lo or in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs The at o
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between comm itt ees has work ed very well , and the result , which we have received today, is mod er ate and thought ful in a very de lic ate area . This mod er ation and thought ful ness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 2 8 0 ( 4 )
If we had to give a pri z e for the ar tic le which was most difficult to understand , least clear and most conf us ed - how ever you like to put it - the competition would be very hard f ought
The Treaty is a colle ction of comple x ar tic l es. However, this one would u nd ou b ted ly be one of the firm favour it es to w in such a pri z e
At the same time, it is an especially de lic ate issue because it deal s with the protection of the Community ' s financial interest s, as Mrs The at o has explain ed very well
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the st ead f ast ch amp ion in this respect - of the need to prot ect the financial interests of the Community . But be careful
As the French say, " ne j et t ons p as le b é b é a ve c l ' e au d u b ain " [ le t us not th row the b ab y out with the b ath water ] , that is to say, in the protection of the Community ' s financial interest s, we must respect , on the one hand - as Mrs The at o has said - the compe ten ces of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizen s, which affect the essential guarant ees
The conclusion s of the The at o report saf eg uard them perf ect ly
Therefore , in my cap ac ity as presid ent of the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et , and, of course, as an M E P , I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission
Mr President, this, as Mrs The at o said, is a cri tical report
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol and it is an own -in iti ative report
One of the reason s why we were very k een to bring this forward was because , whether we like it or not, the European Union has a rep ut ation for fraud and m ism an age ment
It is some tim es ex ag g er ated but there it is . We need to do something about it
S ome of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been hon ou red by some of the Member States - and let us not for get that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 8 0% of the EU budget
A lot of them have not sign ed up to or not ra tif ied the Con vention on the Pro t ection of Fin an cial Inter est s, and therefore it was clear that something more r ad ical needed to be done
We need to take this responsibility serious ly
We need to be able to pro sec ute people who commit fraud against the European Union
The question is : who pro sec utes ?
That is where we really get into difficult y
Wh ose responsibility is it when you are deal ing with a bod y that cross es so many f ron ti ers ?
We need also to be sen si tive to the concerns of Member States
The proposal to set up a European public pro secutor service is a very sen si tive one
We are all aware that an all - out f eder al approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes pre ced ence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore call ing on the IGC to start discussion s
Of most importance to Parliament, as the gu ard ian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions
At a time when we are look ing at the whole reform process it is cri tical that we s end the right sign al
Pe ople need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be pro secut ed, and that is not the case at the moment
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been out l ined by Mrs Pal a ci o
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment de le ting the detail of how the Commission should t ack le this question
We are aware that it is a de lic ate debate
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negoti ate a situation which would be accept able to all par ties
C an I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a cor p us j ur is here , no commitment to a f eder al European public pro secutor
But there is a defin ite commitment to change the stat us qu o which is tot ally unacceptable
Mr President, I would like to start by congratul ating Mrs The at o on her report. I think it is a first -c l ass report which will , for the most part , be support ed by my group
I just have the dis tin ct feel ing that she would have pre fer red to take it a little further at this stage
J ud g ing from the discussion s held over the past five or six month s, this could well be the case
We all know that, in 199 5 , it was ag reed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law
But the Member States fail ed to cooper ate
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , I think
It is now possible , on the basis of Article 2 8 0 of the Treat y, that the Commission will take new initiatives , and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the ear li est opportunity
Un li ke the previous speak er, who has now dis ap pe ared , my group is strong ly in favour of a European Public Pro secutor
My colleag ue J an - K ees W ie b eng a, will u nd ou b ted ly take this point further because he has already p ub lish ed a report on the same subject matter
I think what we need is, at European level , to come up with exact defin i tions of fraud and ir reg ular ity as quickly as possible
I myself have been involved in the committee of in qu ir y on trans it tra ffic
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wr ong , especially when it comes to re ven ue of the European Union, then this will be term ed an ir reg ular ity in one country and a crime in another
This , I thought , is no longer per m is sible , certainly not at the moment
I would like to make one general point on politic s
Wh ate ver we may say about the European ele ction s, the low turn out is a fact
We can improve on this by p un ish ing crime in Europe quick ly, and this must be done at European level
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur
Mrs The at o ' s report may help to rest ore confidence in European institutions
I believe that is something we are all des per ately in need of , bear ing in mind the results of the last European ele ctions and of the level of turn out
Y et , every year we have the same problem
The Court of A ud it ors p ub lish es its report, which critic ises the Member States on account of various in cid ences of fraud
So far , however, the European institutions have not had su fficient means at their disp os al to take v ig or ous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are rem edi ed
It is precisely this process that under min es confidence every year
I believe that Mrs The at o ' s report and her proposal can help to re ver se this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take step s to ensure that European money is employ ed in a t ar get ed man ner and that no fraud is per pe t r ated here
It is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i.e. form ing OLAF from U C LAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF , in order that OLAF too might oper ate within a sec ure legal framework
We will need the European Public Pro secutor ' s O ffice for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarant e es, also for su s pect s
Ha ving said all that, I must say that unfortun ately, my group will not be voting for your report as a un ited f ron t
I hope that the debate will conv ince a few more people
Un fortun ately, however, people still have too many mis g i ving s to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that under min es subsidiarity
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs The at o ' s report recei ves more support
Mr President, we are basic ally in favour of the resolution that has been t abl ed, even if we think that this can only be inter p re ted as an inv it ation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Trea ti es, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guarant e ed
The establish ment of a European Public Pro secutor ' s O ffice and the defin ition of off ences common to all countries of the Union is doubt less a good ide a, but it is imp os sible to consider put ting this into practice without having first introdu ced a European legal system
Inde ed, we are talking about criminal law , the area where res ist ance that national States put up to commun iti s ation is, and will be , f i er ce
Inde ed, it is un th ink able that we could put in place substan ti al and proced ural legal regulations so le ly for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having creat ed a European legal system
R ead ing the precise and compreh ensive expl an ations in the The at o report makes you real ise just how many problems still need to be resol ved and what these problems are
In any case, this idea must be encoura g ed, and it will doubt less be during this attemp t to prot ect financial interests that we real ise that we need to include a Community cor p us i ur is in the Trea ties
On behalf of my group , but also person ally, I hope that the v ital financial spirit of the Union will p ave the way for the cre ation of a European legal system which respect s citizens ' rights and guarant e es, which is to say a legal system that will ra ise guarant ees to the accept able level s h ither t o un se en in many States
Therefore , on behalf of my group , I would like to say that we support the The at o report ; I never thel ess think that this is ess enti ally a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda
Mr President, Mrs The at o ' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests propos es central ising criminal proceed ings by initi ally creating a European Public Pro secutor
This proposal is r ad ic ally opp osed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceed ings that li e at the hear t of the national legal system s must come under the so ver e ign ty of each n ation and li e within the exc lu sive compe t ence of each state
But the idea of a European Public Pro secutor , on the other hand, aim s in the long term to conf ine the national states to a sub ordin ate role in these matters
M ore over , this proposal is li able to set off a ch ain re action of tot ally un fore se en reform s
A cc ord ing to the The at o report, the European Public Pro secutor is need ed, in particular , in order to better support the in qu i ri es of the anti -f ra ud offic e, OLAF
At the same time, however, we see from the van H ult en report under discussion today that the European Public Pro secutor should in turn be superv ised by a European Union cour t
In this way , a small European reform may h ide a medium -si zed one , and a medium -si zed one may h ide a large one
N ot to mention that the large one may h ide a g ig an tic one , as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then , why not a European Minister of Justice , superv ised by an ext ension of the po w ers of the European Parliament ?
I therefore feel we must careful ly consider the bal ance of power that we are in dang er of up se t ting if we put forward this type of reform , which appe ar s to be quite specific
In the final analysis , we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Pro secutor demonstr ate an in ability to con ce ive of a Europe in any thing other than a central ised and h i er ar ch ical form , organ ised a round a su per st ate
The Union for a Europe of N ations Group , on the other hand, wishes to see a po ly c entr ic Europe with n ations link ed in a net work
And such a net work could take the form of impro ved coordin ation between national public pro sec ution author ities, for example, and the cre ation, if necessary , of national te am s special ising in off ences invol ving Community finan ces
So the legal framework , Mr President, is already in place
It is fin e, in principle . It need only be fin e - t un ed
Mr President, Mrs The at o is propos ing institution al rev olution for a two f o ld reason
Public opinion, although indi ffer ent to 2 0 million une mploy ed and th ous and s of m ad c ow s, is now supp osed to be wor ried about the fraud end ang er ing financial interests and these two reason s are supp osed to jus tif y a two f o ld solution : a European criminal cod e with cri m es against the Community and a European Pro secutor - G ener al
Mrs The at o prob ably for g ot to include a European pr is on now that we have the F B I , the European polic e, in the form of OLAF
All this would be established by two regul ations, one for the Public Pro secutor and another for the criminal cod e. The regulations would be adopted purs u ant to Article 2 8 0 of the Treat y, i.e. based on second ary law , whose ch ar ac ter istic fe at ure is that it makes any s ort of second ary sh i ft of emphas is possible
And indeed there is a two f o ld sh i ft
Firstly, the cl ass ic Euro f eder al ist ide ological sh i ft , a single market , a single V A T , a single di p l om atic service , a single ar m y and now a single criminal cod e and a single public pro secutor
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 b illion , while dis reg ard ing the t ens of b illion s of e uro s lo st due to the G ener al ised Sy stem of P re fer en ces, free trade areas, c ust om s present s to Ch i qu it a and the b illion s lo st to the four th resour ce , G D P , as a result of the budget ary r ation ing p act
N ext we have the P ur it an sh i ft : the T e ut on ic Europe of the N orth , the Europe of the L ut her an s, C al v in ists and Q u ak ers, wishes to inf lic t its mor al order on us
B as ic ally, the more we l ose our g ri p on mor al s, the more we t ight en our g ri p on our w al le t
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these day s than there used to be
The fraud and cor ru p tion sc and als of the past have had a prof ound ly dam ag ing effect on the confidence of Europe ' s citizens
The cre di bility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finan ces proper ly stand s and fall s with the efforts we make to deal with such sc and als and prevent them from ar ising in the future
This does not just mean administ ra tive changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instru ments which are actually cap able of aff ord ing protection under criminal law
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate for um for discuss ing this
N ow it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceed ings law are int r in s ic ally matters p ertain ing to the law of the Member States and it is quite un th ink able that they should be govern ed by the principle of subsidiarity
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the adv oc ates of this principle and one of those who opp ose any further ext ension of compe ten ces at European level
When it comes to the demand s made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear deli mit ation of compe ten ces that should take cent re stage
N ow that is not a contra dic tion , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceed ings law , as detail ed in R ec ommend ations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU ' s own interest s, which, as far as that go es, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States ; on the cont r ary , it prot ect s them , at least ind ire ct ly
The comp a ti bility with the various national system s of law , as confirm ed by exper t s, show s that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common , for example where the signific ance of the off ences we have been discuss ing here is concerned
T aking these aspect s into account , I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as propos ed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF
Mr President, will a European Public Pro secutor be able to ab ol ish fo ot b all fraud invol ving EU funds ?
I do not believe so
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing to ol s
An al tern ative to the European Public Pro secutor could be Euro j ust , as proposed at the last S um mit
In the way it is structure d , Euro j ust should cor res pon d to Euro p ol and support inves tig ations into cri m es
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for
OLAF , Euro p ol and the Treaty on E xt ra dition and M ut ual As s ist ance in C ri minal M at ter s should be used fully and, when the F ra ud Con vention from 199 5 is at long last ra tif ied in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this
I non eth el ess agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ra tif ied this Ag ree ment
It is simply too b ad , and I can well understand why people are bec om ing imp a ti ent and demand ing that we have a common European Public Pro secutor ' s O ffice inst ead
However, it would be quite a m am m oth task to establish such an O ffice
It is, after all, only the most serious cri m es which would have consequ ences under criminal law
N in ety per cent of cases would be dis cip lin ary matters concerning ne g lig ence or inc om pe t ence
In st ead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ab ility to sa ck people more e a si ly
We should al ter the sta ff regulations and dis cip lin ary proced ures and, espe ci ally, change our practice
At the mom ent, Article 5 2 of the sta ff regulations concerning dis m is s al on the ground s of g ross ne g lig ence is never used
S h ould we not make a point of c le an ing up our own act and put ting our own h ouse in order before we pl un ge into con stru c ting g rand new institutions !
Mr President, we all want to do something about comb ating European fraud
But the question is now : is the European Union doing any thing about it as well ?
The answer to this is that we know very little about this
The T amp ere S um mit was about comb ating crime
E ver y one was supp osed ly pleased about it but, in reality , we have made little progress
There is no European anti -f ra ud legislation in force because the Member States, as was st ated before , have not ra tif ied the treat y text s sub mitted
So a great deal has to be done in this area
And what exact ly should be done ?
T w o thing s, and Mrs The at o ' s report clearly spe ll s these out
Firstly, the same p en al ty cla us es regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union
So , un ific ation in this small area
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Pro secutor ' s O ffice with two task s, first ly to assist the national public pro secutor s, help ing bring criminal proceed ings in European fraud cases and, second ly, to superv ise Euro p ol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal inves tig ation services which can oper ate at the moment without any judicial superv ision
The European Public Pro secutor ' s O ffice is nothing to be a f ra id of . I feel there is a lot of sc are m ong er ing going on
It is, in fact, something very positive
J ust like Euro p ol
Euro p ol , invol ving polic e cooper ation, does not r ank above the national polic e for ces, but is there for the purp ose of exch ang ing information between polic e for ces
This is exact ly the task which a small , limit ed, European Public Pro secutor ' s O ffice should carry out , not just at the criminal inves tig ation stage , but also at the pro sec ution stage
Parliament support s this
The Committee of W ise M en support s this
I urge the Council of Minister s and the European Commission to do the same
Mr President, I want to concentr ate on the issue of cor p us j ur is
I would very much like to support what Mrs M or gan said on this issue
C or p us j ur is is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation
The idea of a European Public Pro secutor on the contin ent al in qu is itor ial mod el with over ri d ing j ur is dic tion throughout EU terr itor ies would have a major imp act on the tra dition al system s both in Ireland and the U K
The idea of a single criminal cod e and the European Public Pro secutor is something which Member States have a right to be inform ed about
Inde ed when the plan was initi ally dra wn up they said it would be restric ted to cases of fraud against the EU budget
But when cor p us j ur is was actually la un ch ed in 1 9 7 7 in S an S e b as ti an - to a very se lect a ud i ence of 1 4 0 j ur ist s, with no medi a inv ited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr G il - R ob les G il - D el g ad o, said that he considered it em b ry on ic and that the intention was to extend EU compe t ence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activ ity
We need a public debate on this
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be proper ly inform ed
The issue of the threat to the tra dition al legal system in Ireland and the U K needs to be address ed
There needs to be much more open ness and transparency on this issue than there has been to d ate
It is unacceptable that something like this has been fo ist ed on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate
Mr President, on behalf of the It al ian R ad ical Member s, I ab st ain ed on this text in the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol , because I share the concerns that have been v o ic ed, in such an author it ative way , by the represent ative of another legal culture which is certainly important : common law
With this text we are u nd ou b ted ly for cing the issue , since we believe that there are points that must be resol ved and it is important for Community fraud to be c ur b ed, to be c r us h ed
N ever thel ess, the way in which our committee intend s to see this text through , with the d ri ve and st ub b or n des ire of its Ch air , Mrs The at o, will not be without its critic s
A not her major critic ism of the text concerns second ary law
Article 2 8 0 of the Treaty allow s the Council to p in p oint the appropriate instru ments to c ur b fraud
N ever thel ess, we are left feel ing s light ly per p le x ed that they env is age an institution which will mean high er quality , without immedi ately planning how to deal with the rep erc us sion s of this. That is to say, they are ne g le c ting the area of def ence and therefore the possibility for the pro sec ution and the def ence to work together effective ly within such an important legal system
We want ed to express our per p le x ity as regards these points by ab st ain ing in committee
Mr President, we need to speak our mind s on this subject in the European Parliament, during the pl en ary sitting s and in the comm itt e es, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the pla ces where institution al issues are address ed
We find ourselves deal ing with some very serious event s, which in the past seem ed to be the n orm
T od ay , something has chang ed, at least in terms of m ech an ism s, and especially as regards monitor ing, but we are still not satis f i ed, particularly if deb ates are held in compe t ent for a that go as far as to discuss a European Public Pro secutor , cri m es, fraud , the mis app ro pri ation of funds and the disc l os ure of confid ential information p ertain ing to one ' s offic e at European level
I feel that we must clearly saf eg uard the Community ' s interest s, its im age and its relations hip with tax p ay ers, who are an ind is p ens able and essential part of Community life
For this reason , it is right to look at the issue of saf eg uard ing common interest s, and to establish better link s with legal system s within the individual States
In this respect , we are fa ced with the most sen si tive issue : what role would a European Public Pro secutor play in relations with the individual national commun ities and their d om es tic legal system s ?
This issue needs to be expl ore d further in both cultural and practical terms
T od ay , we run the risk of add ing a new institution to the already num erous and var ied institutions which exist within each country
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the ph il os oph ical issues of subsidiarity and the so ver e ign ty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate , for my reg ular view ing of B ri tis h te le vision programmes has sh own me what the national poli ti ci ans are con j uring up there in the way of threat s pos ed by the contin ent to the home - g ro wn legal system
S ome tim es it is worth y of sa tire and m er it s discussion , but I di g ress
The point I want to make rel ates to Mrs The at o ' s report
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are fa cing here - and the European Union e vid ently has only very limited ro om for man o e u v re when it comes to making these off ences li tig able as European criminal off ences - we have become em b ro il ed in legal ities
I am refer ring to R ec ommend ations 1 and 2 . A fter all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Pro secutor , rather , for legal reason s it has now become an independ ent, European authority , or " b od y " to qu ote Mrs The at o
We obvious ly have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis
We also face difficulties with regard to off ences
N ot hing has chang ed there
As has always been the case, there are off ences that trans c end European off en ces, as it were , or at least there is the potential for them to do so , and these might include money - la u nder ing, recei ving st ol en good s, and form ing a criminal organ isation
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial un c ertain ties that need to be over come
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urg ency though - and this is why we intend to vote for rec ital 1 without these recommend ations - is to s end out a clear political sign al to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this dis order ly state of affair s
Mr President, for years, Parliament has call ed for specific and un if orm protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests
Fr ust ration in e v it ably set s in when we see the weak ness of the Con vention ( and of the prot oc ol s relating to this protection ) which, five years after being sign ed, has still not been ra tif ied and has still not come into force
On the other hand, more pro - ac tive attemp t s, such as OLAF , which is currently oper ating , have not all ay ed leg iti m ate concerns about the system of guarant ees for individual rights
The proposals in Mrs The at o ' s report seek to encoura ge the Commission to present a substan tive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interest s, which would criminal ise certain activ ity , specifically fraud against the Community budget . These proposals represent a serious attemp t to establish a new and ever more urg ently - ne ed ed un if orm criminal law for the whole Community
At the same time they call for the exist ence of an independent bod y to coordin ate and monitor the th or ough ness of inves tig ations by OLAF , without harm ing the administration of justice by each Member State and under the superv ision of the European Court of Justice
Finally, following on from what was ag reed in T amp ere , the report rest ates the need for a European Public Pro secutor . This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner V itor in o ' s time ly decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the cre ation of this new role , which everyone con sid ers v ital
We should appro ve this report because it high light s the need to maintain effic ient legal control over our institution s, by prot ec ting the Union' s financial system with a substan tive and proced ural European law which is cap able of maintain ing the cre di bility of the Community ' s economic life
N ever thel ess, it ra ises some very basic questions
Is there currently a su fficient legal basis for jus tif y ing, in legal term s, the cre ation of a specifically Community - w ide criminal law which, although it might be call ed subsidi ary , will always cl as h with the practice , and in certain areas, with the tra dition al , s ep ar ate criminal law of the Member States ?
As there are doubt s, would it not be more adv is able , from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda , and incorpor ate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system al ong the l ines of what is being reques ted for the European Public Pro secutor ?
S ure ly these subject s will be of the gre ates t rele v ance to a re vision of the t rea ties which will contrib ute to the st ability of the area of freedom, security and justice ?
Mr President, the EU is now exp osed to to u gh sc ru tin y
Con f id ence in the European Union has been serious ly dam ag ed. To rem ed y this, v ig or ous efforts are required
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can inves tig ate any su sp ic ion s more effici ently
At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit cri m es against the EU must be able to be held account able in an effective way
It is unfortun ate that the con vention for prot ec ting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of t abl ing proposals ent ail ing the further development of the already existing legal framework
On the other hand, I am not conv in ced that making the process more effic ient in this way requ i res common European legislation or central isation of the fight against crime
In the present situ ation, I am therefore s cep tical about the idea of a European pro secutor , which it is sc ar ce ly possible to implement within the framework of the present treat y
We have more confidence in Euro j ust , where pro secut ors from the individual n ations cooper ate
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against cri m es comm itted against the Union but, rather , that these are comm itted so often and far too se ld om disc over ed
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right m i x
The m ism an age ment and examp les of fraud which occ ur o u ght not to lead to our end ing up in an old -f as h ion ed h i er ar ch ical bureauc ra cy which, through an ex ag g er ated superv ision of detail , prevent s the development of a modern administration
We therefore welcome the ag g res sive approach of Mr van H ult en ' s report
The main idea o u ght to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own superv ision
Our experience of modern administration tell s us that open n ess, dec entral isation of responsibility and qu al if ied e val u ation are often as effective as detail ed bureauc ra tic superv ision
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and effic ient administration without comprom ising on superv ision and the r ule of law
This requ i res sta ff tra in ing, more modern rec ru it ment m eth od s and, above all, open ness and public control
B e ing able to sc ru tin ise the administration effective ly is the best protection against ir reg ular ities
Mr President, rapporteur, rest or ing the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politic s is one of the most important tas ks we have before us
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the over all p ack age of internal reform s docu ments this
Parliament is comm itted to this task , which is something this report bear s imp res sive w it ness to
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again address ed the g en u ine ly difficult question as to what we can do , in terms of creating legal bas es and effec ting institution al change , to step up the fight against fraud per pe t r ated against the European Union
On ra tif ying the Amsterdam Treat y, all Member States st ated that they want ed to accord comb ating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as comb ating fraud to their own det ri ment. Y et as things stand , only the first four Member States have ra tif ied the agreement conclud ed in 199 5
The Commission whole h ear ted ly ag re es with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
A legislative act , a directive , in which there is a standard ised defin ition for the different ty p es of fraud such as money - la u nder ing or cor ru p ti bility , and in which the oblig ation to la un ch criminal proceed ings is ens h r ined as a b ind ing objective , may en able us to take a major step forward s, and I will therefore adv ise the Commission to exam ine this step with all due ha st e
OLAF , the European anti -f ra ud offic e is one of the most important instru ments the Commission has for fulf ill ing its oblig ation to combat fraud
A cc ord ing ly, the Commission ref us ed to put up with the fact that both European b ank s, the E C B and the E I B , cont est ed the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its inves tig ations, c iting their independent stat us
This is why the Commission resol ved on ra ising a comp l ain t against these two ban ks at its last meeting , and I hope that Parliament appro ves this step
The second recommend ation in this report rel ates to assess ing the leg iti m ac y of the inves tig ative measures undert ak en by OLAF in the various European institutions
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF , which was set up at the same time as OLAF , to saf eg uard the independ ence of OLAF , how ever it cannot undert ake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal inves tig ative activities con du ct ed by OLAF
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point
In other words, there is a lo oph o le here which must be f ill ed and I will exam ine the solution adv oc ated in the report in the interests of mo ving things on
There is one thing I would ask though : I believe we must prevent the debate on ext ending the legal basis for OLAF from lead ing to the mis con cep tion that OLAF does not now have enough authority
No , there must be no under min ing of OLAF ' s authority , and ne ither do I think this was the rapporteur ' s intention
As such , I would ask you to give OLAF ' s work your full support , also in its present form
Thank you, Commissioner Sch re y er
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m

Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for cl ar ific ation of the R ul es of Pro ced ure : namely R ul es 1 3 3 ( 2 ) and 1 3 8 ( 4 )
These are both about voting
Is it not the case that on v ot es other than ro ll -c all v ot es, the vote should take place initi ally by show of hand s and only then , if there is some doubt , should we u til ise the elect ron ic voting system ?
That is quite right , Mr He at on - H ar ris . I put the matter to a vote by a show of hand s because n one of the groups had reques ted voting by ro ll call
You know that voting by ro ll call or elect ron ic chec k ing only takes place if Members of the House request it
In this particular case, I can ass ure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on
Mr President, I was not refer ring to that particular vote but to v ot es in general
It is obvious that some presid ents do not look at the hand s, so to speak , but go st ra ight to the elect ron ic voting system
I was w on der ing whether this is the correct procedure
I know it takes long er, but should we not always have a show of hand s first ?
I shall , I ass ure you, Mr He at on - H ar ris , pay particular attention to the show of hand s
I hope to see many hand s raised when the time comes to vote

E X P LA N A T I O N S O F V O T E - O wn resources

 ( F R ) The European Union is app ar ently finan ced through four own resources
The European budget is effective ly sour ced from V A T and on the basis of G D P , especially now that the Community pre ference system has been ab and on ed and the mul ti p lic ation of free trade areas has put pa id to c ust om s d u ties and the common agric ult ural le v y, which had already been c ut back d r as tic ally by the G ener al ised Sy stem of P re fer ences
S ince then , Community V A T fraud and dist or tions in the c al cul ation of G D P , the tax able basis for the four th resour ce , have had a per cep ti ble effect on the y ield and justice of Community resources
S ince then , of course, this Europe with pre ten sion s to f eder al ism is now more than ever finan ced like the common p la ce inter governmental organ isation it actually is, but which it ref us es to see itself as
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us
It show s a concern with the acc oun ting invol ving own resour ces, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of dec la red amount s made available to the Commission
F urther more, the new A d v is ory Committee that has been creat ed is made up of representatives of the tax p ay ing Member States
This is a long way from off s ho ot s such as the " C omm unity criminal cod e " , the " E uro pe an Public Pro secutor " or a European polic e force , with OLAF
There is as yet no f eder al European tax
All the same , a Europe with 2 5 members will be w an ting a European tax on inc ome , if not on pro fit s, or the tax on C O 2 to fin ance the budget for 2 0 2 5
Ko ch Report (A5- 01 0 5 /1999 )
- ( F R ) It is with great satis f action that I welcome this report on impro ved harmon isation in the training of safety adv is ers for the transport of dangerous goods
In recent years, the transport ation of dangerous goods n ation ally and intern ation ally has increased consider ab ly, increasing the risk of ac cid ents
S ome of these ris ks were due to an in ade qu ate aw ar en ess of the ris ks in her ent in such transport ation
It therefore pro ved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intend ed to ensure better risk pre vention
Dire ctive 9 6 / 3 5 / E C was a response to this require ment
F ir ms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the lo ad ing and un lo ad ing oper ations rel ated to such transport ation have been oblig ed, quite right ly, to comp ly with regulations regarding risk pre vention , whether road , ra il or in land water way transport is involved
In order to fa cil it ate achie ving this objective , Dire ctive 9 6 / 3 5 / E C provided for the app oint ment of safety adv is ers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate prof ession al training
This prof ession al training would be t ar get ed at aw ar en ess of the terms of the legisl ation, regulations and administ ra tive conditions applic able to such transport
Wh ile this represent ed significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms govern ing the harmon isation of exam in ation requirements pro ved to be a problem
It therefore seem ed essential to make good this o m ission in order to achieve the standard is ed, high - le vel training of safety adv is ers, but also in order to avoid any disp ar ities between the costs of tra in ing, with a conc om it ant effect on competition between the f ir ms of different Member S ates
The Commission proposal see ks to ensure that the training of safety adv is ers is standard is ed. It out l ines the min imum cont ent of exam in ations and def ines the role of the author ising bod y as well as the requirements demand ed of the exam ining bod ies
Parliament voted in favour of this text . It did , however, t able a number of amendment s, most of which were adopted in the Council ' s common position , particularly regarding the need to draw up a question n a ire and state ments on the author isation of some document in the context of the ' s pe ci fication of the exam in ation ar r ange ments proposed by the exam in ation bod y '
In order to be real istic , I further support post pon ing the d ate for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force
I shall conclud e by emphas ising that harmon ising the prof ession al qu al ific ations of adv is ers will contrib ute to impro ving the quality of the service in the interest of us ers, to min im ising the ris ks of ac cid ent like ly to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage li able to be harm ful to any person who may come into cont act with dangerous goods
Ko ch Report (A5- 01 0 4 /1999 )
L ast O ct o ber I expressed my views on the H at z id ak is report on the transport of dangerous goods by ra il
The views I shall express today are not far rem o ved from those I had then
E s s enti ally, my opinion is as follow s : I dep l ore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous good s, we keep put ting off the adop tion of harmon ised standards to the det ri ment of human being s and the environment
I shall point out that a directive on the appro x im ation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road ca me into force on 1 J an u ary 1997
This included a number of inter im conditions val id until 1 J an u ary 1999
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the d er og ations
In line with the us ual procedure , it is the European Committee for St and ard isation ( C E N ) which put s forward standards in this area , and they are then integr ated in to the European Ag ree ment concerning the Intern ational C ar ri age of D ang erous Go od s by R o ad sign ed in G ene v a in 1 9 5 7 ( know n gener ally as A D R ) , applic able throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applic able within the EU
The C E N has been un able to complete its work in the time all ot t ed. Con sequ ent ly, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intend ed to amend the directive in order to provide a short -term solution to these problem s, rather than to put an end to the tr an sition al ar r ange ment s, as should have been the case !
This is exact ly what happen ed in the case of transport of such goods by ra il , ex cept for the fact that a time limit had been decid ed
Right now we do not have the s light est idea as to when the C E N will be in a position to put forward practical proposals
Un til then , there is really no point in Member States amend ing their national regulations
The report also accept s that some flex ibility may be adopt ed, and grant s States the op tion of adop ting or apply ing al tern ative standards
They may , therefore, continue to en for ce their own standards regarding certain ty p es of press ure v es sel used for transport ation, where there are no applic able European standards
They may also adopt al tern ative conditions for transport ation of a local nature and for ad h oc transport ation
In offer ing this expl an ation of my vote , therefore, I wish ed to express my de ep dis s a tis f action and my de ep concern
Sch ro ed ter Report (A5- 01 0 8 /1999 )
Mr President, I want ed to press home my expl an ation of vote by this or al expl an ation following on from the Sch ro ed ter report with regard to regional development
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give su fficient consideration to the h uge disp ar ities in we alth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe
N ot only the differ ence in inc ome per cap it a but, above all, large disp ar ities in employment continue to give cause for concern
D es pite the fact that the Community , through the structural funds among other s, in ject s consider able su ms into comb ating the disp ar ities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disp ar ities continue to exist
I therefore w on der whether the Community should not have a more d r as tic change of t ack and, based on very str ict e val u ations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disp ar ities in we alth and employment more effective ly
Mr President, in relation to the Sch ro ed ter report, I am aware , and have had it confirm ed to me by Mr B arn i er, that the rules on addition ality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a tr an si tive and transpar ent way in side Member States in favour of s el f- go vern ing regions such as W al es or S c ot land
I regard that as a very un s a tis fact ory state of affair s
I hope we can rev is it this issue at a l ater time
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important res erv ation
- The Sch ro ed ter report speak s of the need to promote partnership s with regard to the sp ending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000 - 2 00 6
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always sp ent in a man ner which m ax im ises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision -m aking process for the sp ending of such funds
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constit u ency of Le in st er, I have always support ed the need for the implementation of b ot t om - up sch em es support ed by national EU funds
I believe that the I r ish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot al one dec ide on specific sp ending prior ities
I believe that local authorities and groups from the priv ate and vol un t ary sector should be fully involved in the decision -m aking process for the sp ending of European Structural Funds
For example, we have seen the success of the L ead er I and L ead er II sch em es in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been creat ed through the administration of these programmes in rural part s of Ireland and within Europe
The L ead er II I sch e me is set to be implemented some time l ater this year
The L ead er programme at its c ore aff ord s an opportunity for public , priv ate and vol un t ary groups to po ol their colle ctive t al ents so as to create long -term and sustainable jobs in small and medium -si zed enter p ris es in rural areas
This is a cl ass ic example of how the partnership con cept oper ates and such sch em es must be support ed in its broad est re mit
The European Pe ace and R ec on ciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border c oun ties in Ireland
On ce again , there is active participation from groups from the priv ate, public and vol un t ary sect ors which suggest how best particular funding can be sp ent so as to help different local job cre ation projects within this region
D uring the next r ound of EU Structural Funds 2000 - 2 00 6 , other EU initiatives such as " E qu al " and " U r ban " will be oper ating
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local commun ities in an effort to i d enti f y where best European Structural Funds should be sp ent
The rapporteur ref ers to the need to implement an integr ated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programm es. They must promote a dec entral is ed, effic ient and compreh ensive partnership based on the s k ill s and commitment of all sect ors in regional and local authorities
This is very sen sible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be over come un less there is key integration between national , European and local funding

 ( F R ) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy
In order to redu ce disp ar ities between regions, of course
But more especially because , even though at first s ight the European market guarant ees us impro ved function ing of the econom y, it may also be a sour ce of in equ ality
J ac ques D el ors was acc ust om ed to saying that the market was short -si ght ed and h ence the political need to redu ce disp ar ities
It is precisely this ph en omen on of solidarity which li es behind the European social mod el , which we are all in favour of , and which g ave r ise to the idea of economic and social cohesion
This is a real political objective , al ong side economic and mon etary affair s, dra wn up in co ll ab or ation with Member States, regions and local commun ities, with the Commission itself responsible for iss u ing guidelines in order to show Member States what dire ction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programm ing
This is why I shall support this report, despite regret ting the fact that, for tim et abl ing reason s, the European Parliament was only consult ed at a very l ate d ate on the guidelines intend ed to assist Member States, regions and local commun ities in the programm ing of Objec tives 1 , 2 and 3
M ore over , I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on E mployment and Social Affair s, add ing a whole ra ft of thought s on key areas such as comb ating social exc lusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy
Mrs Sch ro ed ter ' s report mark s a further step towards the transparency and effec tiveness of structural aid
It high light s the increasing v ital role of all the par ties invol v ed, ch ie f ly those involved at a local level , who are the only on es able to def ine specific requirements and social problem s, h ence our deter mination to ensure that the partnership s to be established are true partnership s, which are dec entral ised and involve all the ag ents concerned
This is the reason for the request which we are put ting forward again to establish a management un it for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordin ate the implementation and administration of aid
In order to do so , the monitoring comm itt ees must be open ed to include Members of the European Parliament, as soci ations and industri al ists concerned by the projects and also civil soci ety
These guidelines represent a step towards the impro ved effec tiveness of Community structural aid
Amend ed again as such by the Sch ro ed ter report, they are a step in the right dire ction
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 200 6 , but that is another subject
In the mean ti me , let us support this first step
- This report call s for d r as tic c ut s in the level of i l leg al state aid dis h ed out by some Member States
Al though I whole h ear ted ly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid e li min ated al t og ether
In my mind , i l leg al state aid amount s to little more than state -s pon s ore d social d u mp ing
We all opp ose social d u mp ing when per pe t r ated by f at c at industry , we must also opp ose it when per pe t r ated by governments
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry glo b ally competi tive and gener ates we alth and employment for all European s, then we must have a level play ing field
I l leg al state aid , by contra st , d est ro y s competi tive companies and cre ates unemployment
There are , of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and leg iti m ate, for example help ing companies rest ruct ure
In all such cas es, however, str ict criteria must be m et and prior appro val from the European Commission g ain ed
Wh ether we are talking about be ef to France or about back h and ers to industry , EU Member States must not be allow ed to f l out the law
I en th u si as tic ally support the report 's proposal to p ub lish a " s c ore b o ard " show ing the amount of state aid per Member State
C ount ri es that cla im to be at the hear t of Europe but which system atic ally b re ak its rules should be n am ed and sh am ed and their h y p oc ris y re ve al ed
Member States cannot be allow ed to pro c la im European solidarity in public while tr ying to under min e the single market in priv ate
I take some m ild encoura ge ment from the fact that level s of state aid to industry in Europe appe ar to be fall ing
M uch remain s to be done , however, and I call on the Commission to be far to u gh er in exp os ing the subsid y j un k ies of Europe

 ( P T ) The Commission' s main instru ments for over coming regional disp ar ities are the Structural Funds and the C o hesion Fund . It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament draft s its broad indic ative guidelines without threat ening the principle of subsidiarity , given that establishing the development strategy for each country fall s to the res pe ctive Member States
Un fortun ately, the European Commission has already mo ved a he ad with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000 - 2 00 6 does not carry much we ight
It is never thel ess important to re iter ate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the gre ates t problems and of the out er most regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the A z ore s and M ade i ra are examp l es. This must be done with the objective of achie ving economic and social cohesion
The tr uth is though , that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indic ations and su fficient funds in areas such as creating dec ent jobs - with rights - effective ly prom oting equ ality in law and opportunity , and supp or ting the social economy and solidarity . There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium -si zed enter p ris es, for impro ving the quality of life of urban popul ations in de pri ved areas, specifically in the field of social h ous ing, with a view to achie ving sustainable urban development
( I T ) Wh ile Article 15 8 of the E C Treaty aim s to promote the harmon ious development of all of the Comm un ities, we must say that the go al of e li min ating disp ar ities is still a long way from being fulf ill ed, or rather in some cas es, as with It aly ' s Objective 1 z on es, par ad o x ic ally, disp ar ities are being ex ac er b at ed, particularly because of the continu ing weak approach of the structural app ar at us to Community proced ures and the pers ist ent m ud d le of proced ures ; despite the changes to the rul es, the Community struct ures have not yet been st ream l ined
In the first place , if administ ra tive proced ures are not simp li f i ed, it will be hard to at tain Community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentr ation
In this respect , the Commission document has short coming s, as it makes no recommend ation to the Member States to simp li f y proced ures and national legislation for the present ation and exam in ation of projects by the national author ities, and for their fund ing, ex ec ution and monitoring
S M E s, m ic ro - ent er p ris es and c ra ft business es in particular are still " w e ak oper at ors " , given that it is precisely for them that the regul atory and administ ra tive con st ra int s imp osed by some Member States, including It al y, are major ob st ac les to access ing Structural Funds
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 9 7 / 99 guidelines ( H ow itt s report ) , the Commission should have consult ed Parliament in time . In fact, it found a s ort of con ven ient ex cu se in the short ening of the programm ing stage in the Member States, and it p ub lish ed the guidelines back in J u ly 1999 , even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative d u ti es, there b y pre ven ting Parliament itself from having any inf lu ence on the current cont ent of the guidelines
This is why the m id -term review , provided for under Article 4 2 of Reg ul ation 12 6 0 / 99 , will be of consider able importance
In general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transpar ent
They mere ly to uch on the - never thel ess important - issue of the possibility of assess ing the progress made in relation to ver if i able objectives which are completely cons on ant with the strateg ies follow ed in Community polic ies, and they do not pay enough attention to the imp lic ations of enlargement , so much so that they do not contain specific provision s or cl ar ific ations as regards either regional and national author ities, or c and id ate countries
That said, the differ ing approach adopted in the guidel in es, which are not g e ared to g e o graph ical objectives , but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive
Wh ile in the ory this may meet the need for concentr ation and therefore the efficiency of inter vention s, we cannot help w on der ing whether the current situation of the Objective 1 z on es allow s, in practice , a policy of integr ated inter vention s, for which an oper ational instrument to coordin ate the appropri ations is necessary
We could then , the ore tic ally, also support the Commission' s call for a management un it for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordin ating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there , p ro vid ed that this un it does not become a central ising instrument at sup r an ational level , but guarant ees real help for those z on es - and I stress this once again - which, o w ing to a whole str ing of con ver g ing ne g ative fact or s, have not yet h ar ness ed Structural Funds to su fficient level s, with the result that rep la cing the g e o graph ical objective with policy areas could , in fact, amount to a ne g ative inter vention
The guidel in es, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because , inst ead of meeting the aim of provid ing guid ance, they are provid ing a sh o pp ing list of possible measure s, a sh o pp ing list which, as it fail s to set prior ities in as c ending order , could even put the Member States on the wr ong tra ck by guid ing them towards a seri es of proposals that is at o d d s with the des ire d concentr ation
We could say that, in this state of affair s, we have once again mis s ed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by r ing -f en cing ever -in c re as ing urban isation and, h ence the d est ru ction of the country side
There has been no appropriate assess ment of the importance of the global grant instrument , which could pro ve to be extremely use ful in red ress ing the bal ance between urban and rural z on es and, more over , would accord proper stat us to local bod ies which, being independ ent, could bring about the conditions for terr itor ial development more quick ly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency , concentr ation and administ ra tive reform
R ural areas must t ru ly be seen as a resour ce which should be increasing ly inves ted in , by encoura g ing y oun g people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social dis int eg ration
It is now a fact that in order to at tain this go al , rural areas need to see the cre ation of new job s, which are no longer so le ly conn ect ed with agric ulture , in the tra dition al sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the pres erv ation of b i od i vers ity - but also , for inst ance, in rural to ur ism, sp ort and cultural activ ities, environmental project s, S M E s, servic es, and so on
A g en u ine fla w in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the or ch est ration of coordin ation between the E S F and employment strateg y. The fact that this coordin ation is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2 00 6 programme period imp lies that the Member States really do need " gu id el ines "
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, s k ir ting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities
In conclusion , the document is not particularly satis fact or y, and in some aspect s is dis app o in ting
B er end Report (A5- 01 0 7 /1999 )

 ( P T ) We basic ally agree with the assess ment and the thought s put forward by the rapporteur concerning the six th period ic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union
We shall therefore conf ine ourselves to high li gh ting a few issues
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states , it must be under st o od that the great improve ment seen by some of the po ore st regions in their per cap it a G D P between 199 1 and 199 6 was large ly due to the inc lusion of the new German L ä nder in c al cul ating the Community a ver age from 199 1 on ward s. This obvious ly caus ed a s light redu ction in the Union' s per cap it a G D P level
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the rec over y seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was acc om p an ied only to a limited extent by grow th in employment . This consequ ently imp os es the need for new development strateg ies, with a consider ably greater level of attention need ing to be pa id to this area
This situation show s that it would be a m ist ake to le ave adop ting measures for prom oting employment to the exc lu sive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report propos es
Finally, but no less important ly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur ' s proposal that, in future , this type of report should also includ e, among st other issues , an analysis of the way cohesion is develop ing between the regions within each State
The h uge var i ety of situ ations and the v ary ing development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in - d ep th assess ment of this issue . This kind of assess ment would en able us to allow and guarantee cor re ctions to regional ( and other ) policies with a view also to guarantee ing internal cohesion within each Member State
( F R ) The B er end report gi ves us an inter es ting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the European Union
N on eth el ess, the French members of the Union for a Europe of N ations Group feel s it cannot appro ve some of the state ments made there in
Par agraph 2 6 , for example, " D ra w s attention to the special need to con so lid ate the budget as a pr ere qu is ite for the success of economic and mon etary un ion and the enlargement of the Union "
At a time when , in order to fulf il the con ver g ence criteri a, Member States are for ced to under go a str ict budget ary s li m m ing reg ime , one that would be perf ect ly jus tif ied if they undert o ok it of their own initiative , the f eder al ists are disp lay ing an a st on ish ing p ec un i ary g l ut t on y
As an ad m ission of the fail ure of the cohesion policy and E M U , the lack of results is put down to the lack of mone y, with everyone compe ting in e lo qu ence to demand more and more appropri ations without any one ask ing questions about the effec tiveness of the money sp ent
What can one say about a budget ary procedure which invol ves set ting objectives for exp end it ure rather than a c e il ing on exp end it ure and tr ying at all costs to find projects in order to sp end the approved appropri ations, rather than alloc ating the appropri ations to existing projects ?
E x p end it ure bec om es an end in itself , e vid ence of the success of a programme
The sta tis tic s p ub lish ed by the European Commission in its six th report do how ever show , as Mr B er end point ed out , the limit ations of the policy being implemented :
The re lative we ight of the most we alth y regions of the European Union was strengthen ed between 1 9 8 6 e t 199 6 , t es tif ying to a concentr ation of we alth , jobs and activ ity in certain areas : H am b ur g , Brus sel s, An t wer p , L u x em bour g , the Par is region , D arm st ad t , O ber b ay ern , B re men , V i en n a, K ar l s ru he and E m ili a - R om ag n a
Q u ite the opp os ite of what the rapporteur stat ed, the establish ment of economic and mon etary un ion should ex ac er b ate the ex od us of population from the most out ly ing, the most rural and the least popul ated regions in favour of the central a x es of the Union ( th e B en el u x countries, N orth W est German y, N ort her n It al y, the Par is ian region , e t c )
The po ore st regions are g ra du ally making good their under de velop ment
In 1 9 8 6 , the a ver age of the 1 0 po ore st regions amount ed to 4 1 % of the over all Community G N P . In 199 6 it was 5 0%
Pro g ress is particularly mark ed in Portug al and Ireland
In fact, if the r ich are ever more we alth y and the extremely po or are less po or , then it seems that the m id d le - r ange regions, cover ed by Objective 2 , are experi en cing an occasion ally significant down t urn in their G N P , and a wor s ening of the employment situation
This ph en omen on is particularly mark ed in France : the G N P of the Ch amp ag ne - A r den n es region , which it is my hon our to represent , has g one from 1 0 5 % to 9 4 % of the Community a ver age , that of the L o ire region has d ro pp ed from 9 5 % to 9 1 % , and that of the A u ver g ne from 8 9 % to 8 3 %
This is a general ised t end ency , sp ar ing ne ither the R h ô ne - A l p es, n or Al s ace
It has been confirm ed in S w ed en and Fin land , countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a wor ry ing de g ree over the last few years, as in many regions of the United K ing d om
It may therefore seem str ange that, when the Structural Funds were reform ed, Objective 2 , d ed ic ated to industri al and rural areas under go ing economic rest ruct uring , should have been sa c ri fic ed in favour of Objec tives 1 and 3 . For the period 1999 - 2 00 6 , the total appropri ation for this Objective will be E C U 2 2 . 5 b illion , a f ig ure more or less i den tical to that for the period 199 4 - 1999
The rural regions elig ible under Objective 5 b will be included among the main vic ti ms of this situation : in Fr ance, 2 7 % of the popul ations elig ible for Structural Funds are going to l ose their elig ibility at the end of the tr an sition period , a f ig ure which is occasion ally much l ar g er in some regions such as the L o ire region , Al s ace or L ow er N orm and y, political str on gh o ld s of the right - w ing that were the vic ti ms of the p et ty political vote ch as ing of the left - w ing co al ition government
B ased as it is on such ch o ic es, it is to be doub ted whether regional policy can contrib ute to harmon ious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union
v on W og au Report (A5- 00 6 9 /1999 )
( F R ) Con sider ing the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s dec la red amb ition to st ead f ast ly att ack unemployment , the analysis of m erg ers carried out by the Commission should take ele ments other than competition into consideration
As an example I would give the rest ruct uring of A B B Al st h om P ow er. A si z e able de leg ation of employ ees of this firm from throughout Europe is vis iting St r as bour g today
The management of A B B Al st h om P ow er, following a m erg er carried out in J un e 1999 , ann oun ced rest ruct uring where there is already the pro s pect of l ay o ff s in a number of countries
This dam ag ing situation for employment ra ises many question s, particularly regarding the information given to the European W or ks Council, in exist ence since 199 6
It suggest s that the Community directive on European W or ks Council s must be up d ated and strengthen ed
It also requ i res the monitoring of m erg ers taking employment , the environment and consum ers into consideration
S ince the report of the Committee on E conom ic and Mon etary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect , I ab st ain ed

 ( P T ) B y propos ing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is dev ol ving to national authorities and cour ts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with ab us es of d om in ant posi tions in relation to compan y agreements which create market dist or tion . Is s ues of m erg ers and state aid however, still remain within the no ti fication system
The position that has now been adopted aim s to create more r ap id way s of apply ing competition policy, mo ving towards apply ing Community law in national cour ts rather than at the European Court of Justice , and even aim s at having special ised cour ts
This parti al r en ational isation of competition policy could involve high er costs for Member States
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out , in the na me of competition policy, public mon op o lies are often exch ang ed for priv ate mon op o li es, with the priv a tis ation of important industri es and public compan ies, as has happen ed in Portug al , with harm ful consequ ences for the country and its work ers
- ( F R ) The Commission' s White Paper on the modern isation of the rules implementing Artic les 8 5 and 8 6 of the E C Treaty ( now 8 1 and 8 2 ) certainly does not propose any " r en ational isation " of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear
But it do es, at least , make it possible to anti cip ate some rather inter es ting op tions for development of the European Union
In fact, taking note of the cong es tion of its services due to the prior no ti fication system of state agreements like ly to cause dist or tions in trade , and a f ra id of see ing the number of no ti fic ations increase yet further with the ar ri val of new Member States, the Commission is propos ing to do away with the prior no ti fication system of such agreement s, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more dec entral ised f as h ion
The most rem ark able th ing, in my view, is the m ess age con ve y ed by this proposal : that the Commission is anti cip ating the consequ ences of enlargement and real ising that this necess ar i ly, and v ir t ually a ut om atic ally, requ i res reform of the central ised system
A d mitted ly, this reform is one of increasing flex ibility rather than dis m ant ling
Inde ed, the White Paper env is ag es that the Commission will re tain the superv ision and central dire ction of the new system
M ore over , the v on W og au report, which the European Parliament has just voted on , support s it in so doing
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the up he a val caus ed by enlargement may lead to Community compe ten ces being limited and subsidiarity being extend ed
It is a quite different Europe which is taking sh a pe in the long term
Is this not, inde ed, what is so dist ress ing to some Social ist Members of the European Parliament ?
The German Social Dem ocrat s voted against the v on W og au report because , in their view, it might b re ak up European policy on competition , which is to say, in pl ain term s, att ack ing the standard ising su per st ate
C ur ious ly, a number of employ ers ag reed with them , pre fer ring the European " one - st op " system , which they consider to be more economic al and more st able leg ally
Inde ed, this is one adv ant age of the present system
But , on the other hand, the w ider view must also be taken , namely that the initi al dec entral isation which has been be g un today may , in the long term , lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account , and this will be of benefit to everyone
R ap k ay Report (A5- 00 7 8 /1999 )
The Members of Parliament from the L ut te O u v ri è re Party shall not be voting in favour of these report s on European competition policy
C om pe ti tion is a w ar which has major concerns f igh ting each other , which con st ant ly takes the form of l ay o ff s, fact ory clos ure s, not to mention ext ensive w ast e of produ ction cap ac ity
We see a further example of this with the plan n ed l ay o ff s in Europe proposed by the cor por ation A B B Al st h om P ow er
E ight een million une mploy ed and 5 0 million po or people within the European Union, despite its being one of the we alth i est regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote
The Commission' s dec la red intention to regul ate the conditions of competition on the European market is r id ic ul ou s, for the only law which competition respect s is the law of the j un g le where the most power ful s qu as h or de vour the weak est ele ments
This is rep ul sive most of all in social terms
The European Commission' s report is a b l un t demonst ration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in any thing ex cept the major capital ist cor por ations who are en g aged in this economic w ar f are and have no interest in the vic ti ms this caus es
There is nothing to prevent the sp read of unemployment , nothing to prot ect employ e es, nothing to prevent the major concerns d ri ving part of the population into po ver ty simply to make their share ho ld ers r ich er still !
We ac know ledge that this report does have one good point - it show s that the working cl ass majority in soci ety can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of saf eg uard ing their living condition s, and still less of impro ving them
- ( F R ) In voting against this report, we are ac ting as sp ok es p ers ons for all the m en and women who in S e at t le and throughout Europe expressed their re jec tion of a world redu ced to str ict comm er cial l og ic
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public servic es, in m em ory of the vic ti ms of the P ad d ing t on ra il disast er, k ill ed not by f ate but by an abs ur d deter mination to have competition where there should inst ead be regulations
This report is ess enti ally a pri m i tive text with no ins p ir ation other than the law of the j un g le , for it is not competition that can s ol ve the problems fa cing human ity at this turn of the cent ur y
Wh ether it is a matter of the bal ance of the b i os ph ere , culture or cooperation with the third world , ex ces sive competition is a fact or increasing reg ression and in sec urity
Do you im ag ine that the 1 8 million une mploy ed people in Europe are vic ti ms of too re tic ent an application of this competition policy ?
We are conv in ced that the opp os ite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by defin ition ex ces sive
E x ces sive in comp ar is on with what i ron r ule , what criteria of efficiency ?
Finally, after S e at t le , do you really think you can adv oc ate increasing the role of the W T O ?
On ly the legal adv is ers to mul tin ational s could demonstr ate such st ub b or n ness
J on ck he er Report (A5- 00 8 7 /1999 )
I am pleased to see the quality of the se vent h report on state aid within the EU , and to see that it will h ence fort h be an ann ual report, and also that the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for C om pe ti tion will be making inform ation, both general and specific , public ly ac ces sible v ia its we b s ite
I am happ y with the rapporteur ' s treat ment of state aid and I congratulate him on this
There is too often a t end ency to critic ise state aid h ar s h ly as a measure caus ing dist or tion in competition
A d mitted ly, an effective competition policy is a pr ere qu is ite for the proper oper ation of the internal market and of economic and mon etary un ion
However, as the rapporteur point ed out , such aid is occasion ally essential and may , in addition to en abl ing the sur v i val of a specific firm , make it possible to contrib ute to sustainable development (A r tic le 6 of the Treaty ) , services of general economic interest (A r tic le 1 6 ) and economic and social cohesion (A r tic le 15 8 )
C lear ly though , it must be mon it ore d , a task which fall s to the European Commission
The aid which Union Member States alloc ate each year to the sect ors under consideration reached a total of EUR 9 5 b illion in the period 199 5- 199 7 , including 4 0% alloc ated to the manufact uring sector
This aid is consider ably less than the previous period , 199 3 - 199 5 ( a 1 3 % d ro p in the total amount and a d ro p from 3 . 8 % to 2 . 6 % in the amount of aid to the manufact uring sector )
This down t urn in aid is ch ie f ly due to the redu ction in aid grant ed to the new German L ä nder
Li ke the rapporteur, I dep l ore the fact that the f ig ures given in the report do not cover all state aid
The European Commission must make good these o m ission s as soon as possible
It must also cooper ate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of d at a in good time, which is to say in time for the n in th report
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission p ub lish ed a reg ister speci f ying the amount of state aid per Member State
I also dep l ore the fact that the European Parliament has been tot ally exc lud ed from the A d v is ory Committee on State A id
In order to comp ens ate for this situ ation, the European Commission should be oblig ed to make reg ular report s to us
I shall conclud e with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous : the matter of aid res ul ting in business es rel oc ating from one Member State to another , with the risk of subsid y h un ting which makes no contribution to the sh ared objectives of the EU
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assess ment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and c ra ft business es in the bene fic i ary countries
L ang en Report (A5- 00 7 3 /1999 )
In the important debate on competition this mor ning , I expressed my views on Mr L ang en ' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the six th St eel A id C od e
J ust as the Court of Justice recogn ised in its order of 3 M ay 199 6 , the i ron and steel industry is particularly sen si tive to dist ur ban ces to its competi tive oper ation
E st ablish ing a system of aid s to this sector intend ed to ensure the sur v i val of successful f ir ms was therefore jus tif i able , even though Article 4 ( c ) , of the E C S C Treaty pro h ib ited any s ort of state aid to the steel industry
This , inde ed, is the purp ose of the six th St eel A id C od e
At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any dist ur b ance of competition conditions or of the market s, h ence the importance of regul ating such aid
It is therefore essential to continue to restric t state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid grant ed in the event of pl ant clos ure
In the same way , it is v ital for Member States to fulf il their oblig ation to report to the Commission on the aid grant ed to their steel undert aking s, as sti pul ated under Article 7 of the St eel A id C od e
The Commission suggest s that Member States sub mit their report s within a time limit of two months following the end of each six -m on th period or , at least , ann u ally, without the need for remind ers
Li ke the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did dep l ore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid
Al though the St eel A id C od e is expressed in a very clear way , the Commission has , on a number of occasion s, author ised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the c ateg or ies set out in the cod e
In the interests of equ ality , there are ground s to either apply the St eel A id C od e str ict ly or mod if y the C od e if the Commission wishes to author ise ty p es of aid other than those leg ally accept able at the moment
Finally, we have the problem of the consequ ences of the exp ir y of the E C S C Treaty
The aid system must effective ly be continu ed be y ond 200 2
My feel ing in this respect is that only a Council Reg ul ation can provide the necessary legal certain ty and ensure an official ban on any aid not cover ed by the cod e
For all these reason s I voted in favour of the L ang en report, and I now aw a it the Commission' s response to our reques ts and demand s
( T he sitting was su sp end ed at 1 . 0 5 p . m. and res um ed at 3 p . m. )
O il s lic k off the French co ast
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil s lic k off the French co ast
Mrs de Pal a ci o will open the debate on behalf of the Commission
Mr President, I shall be spe aking on behalf of the P P E - D E Group , but also as an elect ed represent ative for Br itt an y, and I am therefore direct ly concerned and sh ock ed by these event s
T og ether with Mrs G ros se t ê te and the P P E - D E Group , we tabled a motion for a resolution
I am pleased to see that we have today ar ri ved at a comprom ise motion
The E ri k a ship w re ck is a t ru ly European issue , first ly because it is dis f ig uring and po ll u ting some of the most be au ti ful be ach es in Europe, with extremely serious consequ ences for to ur ism, people who ear n their living from the se a and environmental ist s, and also because the under ly ing issue is the regulation and monitoring which o u ght nat ur ally to be on a European sc al e
A disaster of this sc al e could al most certainly not have occ ur red al ong the Am er ic an co ast line , and why ?
B ec ause the Am er ic ans man aged to le arn their less on from the E x x on V al de z disaster and in 199 0 to draw up the O il P o ll ution A ct , which makes the par ties concerned aware of their respon sib ili ti es, as it makes it possible to hold the ch arter er li able , and is more restric tive , and, more espe ci ally, more careful ly mon it ore d than ks to various regulations and, in particular , the exist ence of the Am er ic an co ast gu ard
If , I repe at , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would sure ly not have occ ur red
This is why we think that the applic able legislation must be review ed, particularly the 199 2 prot oc ol which has ex emp ted the ship own ers, in this case the oil t ank er ch arter er, from any liability
We ll , if the ch arter er is ex on er at ed, then of course he is less concerned with the ins pe ctions which oil companies are responsible for
The regulations must therefore be review ed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for high li gh ting the in ade qu ate fe at ures of current European regulations
M ore over , as you said, monitoring must above all be st e pp ed up : that of the fla g state , that of the cl as si fication soci e ties
You to ld us that R I N A was an It al ian cl as si fication reg ister recogn ised by the Commission
What are the conditions for this recogn ition ?
What guarant ees are there of its re li ability ?
You are going to comm ission a fact -f ind ing m ission
We aw a it the out come with great interest
In s pe ctions by the maritime authorities and superv ision within European p ort s must also be t ight en ed up
There is a Par is M em or and um in exist ence, let me remind you, which sti pul ates a min imum for ins pe ction , that is, one in four of the v es sels put ting into European p ort s must be ins pect ed by the maritime authorities of the country concerned
This oblig ation is not respect ed either in France or in many other European countries
Wh y not ?
What conclusion s has the Commission already dra wn or what conclusion s is it going to draw ?
I also think it essential to step up the level of ins pe ction that the ch arter er is responsible for , in this case, the oil compan y
If the ch arter er ' s liability ent ail s a financial commitment , then doubt less the ins pe ction will be en for ced to a greater extent
Finally, we need some coordin ation of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some s ort of European fa cil ity comp ar able to the co ast gu ard s who superv ise the co ast s of the United States
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approach ed this particular problem joint ly with their transport te am . This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not conf ined to one area
H ere we are here again in this Parliament discuss ing yet another maritime disaster
I could re el off the list of disast ers that have aff lic ted this industry in my 1 0 years in this Parliament but I only have three min utes
S ure ly it is now about time that not only the Member States but that to oth less t ig er that is know n as the Intern ational Mar itime O r gan is ation, and last but not least , the oil companies and t ank er own ers take on their respon sib ili ties by ac ting to st op these ec ological and human tra ged ies repe ating themselves year after year
How many more E ri k as do we have to end ure before the po w ers that be deli ver to us a proper p ort state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it ?
How much more po ll ution do we have to end ure before the industry deli vers us t ank ers with s eg reg ated t an ks and dou ble hold s ?
How many more se ab ird s are to di e before sh i pp ing companies end the practice of c le an ing their t an ks at se a which, as our resolution points out , caus es far more po ll ution than any E ri k a - ty pe disaster ?
Wh ile I recogn ise that some progress has been made in areas like p ort state control and min im al cre w ing standard s, we are still fa ced with what our l ate colleag ue K en St e w art used to call ' s hip s of sh a me sa il ing in and out of our European Union w at ers : r ust bu ck et s b ad ly cre w ed '
We need the Member States to act quickly and dec is ive ly
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to st op dra gg ing their fe et when it comes to maritime safety
The E ri k a cost no human li ves but it may have r u ined many human live li ho od s. J ust as the S e a E mp res s, just as the B ra er did
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ec ological disaster
My group 's sy mp ath y goes out to the people of Br itt an y who have seen their area des p o il ed by this disast er, just as my group 's sy mp ath y w ent out to the people of W est W al es and to the S h et land Is land s on previous occasion s
Is it not about time that we st o pp ed express ing sy mp ath y and st ar ted iss u ing en for ce ment no tic es to get r id of these ship s of sh a me in favour of saf e se as or we will be back again , l ater on this year , discuss ing a new motion for a resolution when yet another fla g -of- con ven i ence t ank er s ad ly goes down spe w ing its c r ud e oil all over the se a
The time for resolution s has pass ed. What is now needed is action
S ad ly, I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discuss ing yet another maritime and ec ological disaster
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again
In reality we can never st op ac cid ents happen ing at se a, but it is inc um b ent upon us all to le arn the less ons when ever an in cid ent of this kind takes place and apply those less ons to redu ce ris ks in future
The " E ri k a " in cid ent was serious especially for the people of Br itt an y most close ly affect ed, but it was dev ast ating for the w ild life of much of Europe
S ome say that it is the wor st ac cid ent that has ever be f all en the b ird life of this part of Europe
The R o y al So ci ety for the Pro t ection of B ird s belie ves that as many as 4 00 , 000 b ird s, perhaps main ly gu il le m ot s, may have di ed
The p ict ures many of us will have seen of oil - so ak ed b ird s being put down by v et er in ary official s were both dist ress ing and tra g ic
We all want the high est standards for ship s wh ate ver fla g they may be f ly ing
We need to en for ce the regulations and ensure that the " p o ll ut er pay s " principle is appli ed so that financial p en al ties and some inc en tives are used to put press ure on both ship oper at ors and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introdu ced
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her rem ark s, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introdu ced to deal with the problem in the way she propos es ?
As a poli ti ci an she needs to remind her official s how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year , were a sim ilar in cid ent, just as dev ast ating , to take place , if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remain ing as fin e words and she had not had the ch ance to put them into practice
The thought of an in cid ent of this kind occ urr ing in the ne ar future should concentr ate her mind and the mind s of her official s w on der ful ly
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gi ft . H ere is a c ake of oil s ent by some one living on the French is land of No irm ou ti er who w ro te to me as follow s : " W ith every t ide , the be ach is cover ed with he av y f ue l oil which has le ak ed out of the E ri k a
With every t ide , the vol un te ers, members of the ar m ed for ces and f ire men rem ove great p an c akes of this th ick , s tic k y, b la ck t ar
When will we see a ret urn to c le an l iness and the end of this dev ast ating ac cid ent ? "
Inde ed this disaster invol ving the E ri k a, like that of the R us si an v es sel in Turke y, more over , is unacceptable and int ol er able at a time when the u l tim ate h i - t ech techn olog y is available
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occ ur tw ent y years after the Am oc o C ad i z disast er, despite our saying at the time and many tim es since , " N ever again ! "
It is, of course, the responsibility of polic ies, and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of se a transport
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again
But , list ening to you, Commissioner, we are some wh at f r ust r ated because any one already involved in these matters know s that in 199 2 , I believe , the Commission and Parliament d re w up a very inter es ting text which already contain ed all the proposals included in the resolution dra wn up by the transport committee
Inde ed, we must say and keep saying that the E ri k a is one disaster too many
This is why it is essential , as a matter of urg ency , for the European Union to undert ake a r ad ical review of its dire ctives on se a transport to make them more restric tive and to establish clear and specific regulations deter min ing the respon sib ili ties of the own ers of the car go es
We should be aware , for example, that S he ll and B ri tis h P et ro le um ref us ed to use the E ri k a to transport their oil
Wh y, in these circ um stan ces, is the liability of T ot al as ch arter er not recogn ised ?
Y our proposals must also include making dou ble h ull s m and atory and en for cing obs erv ance, at last , of the ban on de g ass ing at se a
A European ins pe ction bod y must be established which can monitor the condition of v es sels effective ly and effici ently
In addition , it is also essential for the European Union to undert ake to reform the I M O , as a matter of urg ency
What point is there in iss u ing restric tive dire ctives if , once they are at se a, most v es sels do just what they wish ?
Finally, a comp as sion ate thought for all the vol un te ers, nature lo vers and b ird lo ver s, who s pon t an e ous ly and gener ous ly are coming through to the aid of the oil -c over ed b ird s, organ ising res c ue oper ation with the means available
I can t es tif y to this rem ark able work
You are no doubt aware that appro x im ately 200 0 00 b ird s are going to di e as a result of this oil s lic k , which is a major ec ological disast er, prac tic ally un p re ced ent ed in sc al e
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is now ad ay s to pres erve nat ural speci es as well as nat ural sp ac es
And , on this subject , Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intend s to contrib ute to the rest or ation of the nat ural environment and the nat ural ha b it at s
On ce again , there will be no clearly def ined party responsible
In the mean ti me , it is nature that is taking the r ap , as always
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people direct ly affect ed by this ec ological disast er, affect ed both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their att ach ment to their nat ural environment
Let me , in this connection , welcome the pres ence in the vis it ors ' g all er y of Mrs J ave t te - L e B es q ue , sp ok es p ers on for the oil s lic k action group " M ar é e no ire " , made up of m en and women from the French dep art ment of M or b i h an
M an y vol un te ers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by l ending a hand to the vic ti ms in the field
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity pri m arily by taking action in order to ensure the immedi ate rele ase of em erg ency aid to the fam ili es affect ed by the oil s lic k and, at the same time, demand ing t ight ening up of the quality criteri a, on the European and international sc al e, of the regulations and standards govern ing the safety of se a transport , sti pul ating much more f re qu ent ins pe ction and s an ctions that are a far greater deter r ent to off end ers
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the a ge of oil t ank ers
Am ong those ins pect ed and found to be in contra vention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 2 0 years old and some were 3 0 and more
This is no longer to ler able
N ext , we have fla g s of con ven i ence
A cc ord ing to the Intern ational Transport F eder ation, over 4 0% of the ship s w re ck ed in 1998 were sa il ing under fla g s of con ven i ence, the sy mb ol of pro fit and the exp lo it ation of human being s at the exp en se of safety
This is no longer to ler able
Finally, there is the lack of transparency
E ver y thing is done to make the l ines of responsibility , the i den tit y of the own ers and real decision -m ak ers as imp en et ra ble as possible
This is no longer to ler able
In all these respect s we must ensure real , significant change , including set ting a time limit for the s w it ch to new standard s, including the m and atory dou ble h ull , on p ain of being b ann ed from the p ort s or the terr itor ial w at ers of Member States
We must also ensure increased str ict ness both in iss u ing se a - w orth iness c er ti fic ates and in monitoring the condition and the main ten ance of v es sels
Fin ally we must ensure that all the par ties responsible for disast ers contrib ute to rep air ing the damage caus ed
I am think ing specifically of T ot al - F in a in the present inst ance
This is an approach , Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the Intern ational Mar itime O r gan isation
In so do ing, it will have pro ved its use ful ness to public opinion which, in this inst ance, is aw a iting clear , t ang ible action
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French At l an tic co ast , for V end é e, I should first like to express the dis g ust of the people who are the vic ti ms of the E ri k a oil s lic k in the face of these disast ers, caus ed not by a nat ural disaster such as the h urr ic an e which has also just st ru ck us, but by a crime
In this em erg ency , in this or de al , we have seen a m ag n ific ent disp lay of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and inter governmental solidarity
What the str ick en popul ations are w a iting for now , those who have lo st every th ing, particularly among those who made their living from the se a and from to ur ism, those people whose business es have been comprom ised for several years to come , is not for the po ll ut ers to rep air the damage they have caus ed, but for the g ear s to now be set in motion to ensure that their present mis fortun e s er ves to prevent sim ilar cri m es aff ec ting other people in future
Q u ite clear ly, we are now pay ing the pr ice for our lack of concern
B ec ause our states , with the b less ing of the Community , did not de em it use ful to have its own comm er cial fle et and allow ed me tic ul ous ship b u ild ing know - h ow to dis ap pe ar , we no longer have access to the clear tra ce ability of v es sels and we can see ver it able co ff in ship s na v ig ating our w at ers under fla g s of con ven i ence, d ri f ting according to the short -term interests of the mul tin ational s
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this f lo od ti de of ir res pon sibility , ir res pon sible ch arter ers, un t ra ce able ship own ers and l en ient c er ti fication companies
So today we find ourselves in a state of u t ter conf u sion
Ob vious ly, such matters should be hand led at world level , but the current international regulations of the I M O are far from ad equ ate and are far too lo ose , and ne ither our own countries n or the Community have t ried deter min ed ly to make them str ic ter , despite previous disast ers
A d mitted ly, there is the Intern ational O il P o ll ution C om p ens ation Fund , I O P C F , but it w at ers down the issue of liability and set s its c e il ing at a quite in ade qu ate level , which must be review ed
The question of fla g s of con ven i ence must be review ed within the I M O
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this
Let me remind you that the E ri k a was sa il ing under a fla g of con ven i ence, that of a state apply ing for members hip of the European Union
In addition , there are Community dire ctives , but they are se ld om appli ed, if at all, due to the ins u fficient number of national ins pect ors
This o m ission must be rem edi ed as a matter of urg ency
A directive on maritime safety has been in prepar ation for many years, but it is making very s low progress
The Commission is disp lay ing int ol er able in er ti a and unacceptable short com ings
The d ate when the Commission is supp osed to present its communication dev oted to this key issue is put off time and again . It is now sch ed ul ed for J u ly
The terms of the regulations to be en for ced must be particularly clear and str ict
I shall mention three issues that our group feel s are prior ities
Firstly, the liability of own ers of oil car go es must be clearly established and the vic ti ms of po ll ution in cid ents must be able to cla im on this liability une qu iv oc ally
The best form of pre vention we can offer for the future is the sure know ledge we can offer ch arter ers that they will be he av ily p en al ised in civil , criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely v ig il ant regarding the matter of the safety of the v es sels they se lect
Secondly, the require ment of the dou ble h ull as a condition for access to Community w at ers must be en for ced as soon as possible and c e ase to be put off inde f in ite ly
Th ird ly, a str ict a ge limit on v es sels to be given access to Community w at ers must be established in the ne ar future
This could be of a m ax imum of 15 years of a ge
If we do not ob tain a framework of Community regulations which is su ffic i ently clear , str ict and tr ench ant , then those Member States that wish to do so must be allow ed to take the necessary step s to prot ect their people and their terr itor y, in the same way that the United States suc ceed ed in le ar ning the less ons of the E x x on V al de z disaster by making dou ble h ull s comp ul s ory and ban ning all v es sels more than 2 0 years old from their w at ers
Th u s, the E ri k a was ref us ed access to Am er ic an w at ers
If the European Community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoid ed
Let us ensure , Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do le arn the less on , even after the medi a h y pe and the sh ock of this House have di ed down
Mr President, T or re y C an y on , O ly mp ic B ra ver y, Ha ven , Am oc o C ad i z , G in o, T an i o, so many n am es we re me mber with h or r or
And now the E ri k a
Wh ose turn is next ?
T w ent y one years after Am oc o C ad i z , this u mp te ent h oil s lic k , the se vent h since 1 9 6 7 , show s the ir res pon sibility of our suc ces sive rul ers
The At l an tic W est C o ast once again is pay ing a high pr ice for their in ability to re act , for their cap it ul ation to the mul tin ational s
It is hard to understand why the French and the European s allow something which the Am er ic ans ref use to accept , and why Europe, n orm ally so quick to pass environmental legisl ation, has ch os en to over lo ok the matter of maritime safety
And this is the result
The E ri k a, a v es sel f ly ing a M al t ese fla g , a f lo ating r ust bu ck et , cl ass ed among st the most dangerous type of oil t ank ers, has cont am in ated more than 4 00 k m of our co ast line , a case of po ll ution even wor se than that caus ed by the Am oc o C ad i z
As an elect ed represent ative for the L o ire - A t l an ti q ue region , unfortun ately, I can t es tif y to this
There is nothing nat ural about these rec urr ing disast ers, they are the result of f ate
They are the result of human thought less ness
What we have here is an ec ological disaster
On ly the people c ut off from the h ar s h reality of the gr ass ro ot s could have any doubt about that
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the se a and from to ur ism, fish er men , o y ster farm ers, she ll f ish farm ers, people who make a living from the s al t mar s h es, sh op k ee per s, e t c
The E ri k a disaster must be the last in the seri es
First of all, we must sh ed some light on this ship w re ck
Wh y do we not app oint a parliament ary committee of in qu ir y or get Members of Parliament involved in the te am of exper ts which has just been ann oun ced by the Commission ?
N ext , as a matter of urg ency , we m us s pass legisl ation, first ly, regarding i d enti fication of the exact ch ar ac ter istic s of goods transport ed
In fact, according to the exper t s, the oil the E ri k a was carry ing was supp osed to s ink to the b ot t om and should never have reached the co ast
We know what actually happen ed
N ext , re li able technical ins pe ction must be established like the technical ins pe ction comp ul s ory in France for vehicles more than five years old
We must regul ate the use of fla g s of con ven i ence, make dou ble h ull s m and atory for the transport of po ll u ting or dangerous materi al s, work on techn ological innov ations in order to be able to process or rec over h y d ro c ar b ons at se a
This would be a min imum require ment , I believe , on the d a wn of the third m ill en n ium
N on - com p li ant v es sels must be d en ied access to European water s, the responsibility of po ll ut ers, ship own ers or ch arter ers must be deter min ed in line with the principle of the " p o ll ut er pay s " , maritime superv ision must be strengthen ed to prevent any de g ass ing, th or ough and re li able ins pe ction of t ank ers must be required , an appropriate " n at ural disast ers " budget line must be re - est ablish ed for Member States and, in the mean ti me , Community aid rele ased on an excep tion al basis and the French dep art ments affect ed by the disaster should be made elig ible for Structural Funds
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the E D D Group
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a suc ces sion of serious t ank er disast ers world - w ide and the c oun ter me as ures taken have either been in e ff ec tive or not worth mention ing
It is particularly b ad this time, not least because it has affect ed a major European State ; an in cid ent which could happen again at any time
We urg ently require a directive if we are to redu ce these ris ks
The 15 clearly do not su ffice
These guarantee - making no cla im to be ex h a us tive - a min imum of 3 thing s. No t ank er or f re igh ter f it only for the sc ra p he ap must ever put into any h ar bour within the European Union again
All those invol v ed, including the transport ag ent, are responsible for any ens u ing damage , and these individual s are to provide satis fact ory ass ur an ces
This is the only way of aff ord ing the vic ti ms the opportunity to make their cla im s for comp ens ation
However, we must aim high er in the long -term , let there be no m ist ake about that
In other words, we need real cost - e ff ec tiveness for our entire energy supp ly system
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Pal a ci o very much for her clear , ad equ ate and, at the same time, very firm response
M an y than ks for this
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the brief ing note which she s ent on 1 0 J an u ary but also for the action points which she ann oun ced today
The E ri k a disaster show s that when s ound tra ffic and transport regulations are lack ing at international and European level , nature and the environment come off second -b est
The damage su ffer ed, also in ec ological term s, cannot be expressed in money
H ence also this joint debate invol ving transport and environmental management Members
D uring the Ch r ist m as b re ak , when the D ut ch medi a received attention for the E ri k a disast er, I had a look , just out of interest , on the Intern et to see what ar r ange ments were , in fact, already in place for the purp ose of taking rele vant measure s, especially after P re m i er J os p in had said that Europe should do more
What I le arn ed is that, act u ally, there is su fficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of superv ision
C ould I high light a few points which have also been to uch ed upon by the Commissioner ?
First of all, the p ort - st ate control , according to which 2 5 % of all ship s require ins pe ction
I think that this 2 5 % should not only be en for ced but that it should also be ensure d that more ins pe ctions take place
So this 2 5 % should be increased
F urther more, if a ship is no longer se a w orth y, not only should the fact s be exam in ed, but a legal system should be introdu ced which states or recommend s that the v es sel should no longer be used
But this is not in place
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ship s are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ship s should in any case be dou ble - h ull ed
In my opinion, we should look further into this point , and I also think that the Mar p ol Treat y, which comes into effect in 200 1 , should be look ed at very close ly
Mr President, I would like to take a brief , cri tical look at the ac ces sion negotiations with M al t a and would like to express my g ra tit ud e to , and ad m ir ation for , the many N G O s that have at least ro ll ed up their s le e ves in order to sa ve an im als
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many tim es in the past
We have achie ved nothing so far , and we have been un able to reach agreement within the European Union
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has ann oun ced here , actually lead s to legislation being produ ced ; in other words, if you all go and say to your H ead s of Government and Minister s : " y ou must p us h this through in the Council of Minister s "
A llow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental c at ast ro p he , which also imp act s on the economy and threat ens live li ho od s
So what are we to do now ?
I have no intention of talking about past event s ; rather I want to look to the future
What are we to do now ?
I will tell you a few things we should do
Of course, we need dou ble - h ull ed v es sels
That goes without say ing, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term
So what do we need to happen immedi ately ?
We need technical t es ting of ship s, that is oblig atory technical t es ting every two years, and no ship to be oper ated without the acc om p an ying c er ti fic ate
We need this at European level and intern ation ally ; we need something like a T Ü V , an organ isation that undert akes technical t es ting of m ot or vehicles in German y, which is comp ul s ory every two years
If you do not have a c er ti fic ate then you are not allow ed to oper ate the vehic le
This is what we need for ship s
Th ird ly, we need to carry out chec ks on these safety and ins ur ance c er ti fic ates in the p ort s, that is in every p ort of the European Union
An y fail ure to produ ce these c er ti fic ates must lead to the ship being la id up and pro h ib ited from le a ving the p ort , regard less of all the p ort ch ar g es
We must reach agreement here , in all the European Union' s p ort s, from Mar se ill es, through to R ot ter dam , to W il h el ms h a ven , C u x h a ven , and where ver ship s d ro p an ch or
F our th ly, we need the ship own er to bear liability , and not just to the t un e of a d er is ory U S D 12 million , but to the value of at least U S D 4 00 million , to be cover ed per ins ur ance c er ti fic ate
We also need the country whose fla g the ship f lies to bear liability
We need to be sure that if need be , the country whose fla g the ship is f ly ing will accept liability
This would be a mar ve ll ous ex erc ise in superv ision !
I can ass ure you that those countries a ward ing fla g s would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability
In the f if th place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demand s will apply to all ship s using the p ort s and water ways of the European Union, and in cid ent ally, that includ es the c and id ate countries
L ast but not least , we need a long m em or y, for the issue of legislation will c ro p up on the agenda more f re qu ently in the ne ar future
En v ironment al standards will be a rec urr ing the me
I would not like to have some one coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job l os s es in the p ort s
The un ion s will have something to say as will industry
A long m em ory will s erve us well , ladies and gentlemen
I am look ing at all those of you who have not exact ly been at the fore f ron t of the environmental movement
J ust you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to d ate "
We need to have a long m em ory when it comes to the demand s being made in the p ort s
We need to have a long m em ory when we say : " for once we are un it ed, at last as far as p ort ch ar g es and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union. "
If we suc ceed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time !
Mr President, Mrs R oth - B eh r end t expressed very many of my own thought s
We have now ob tain ed a first - r ate en um er ation of a var i ety of measures
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ec ological disaster has l ed ?
I would comp are the situation with an ear li er gener ation ' s introdu ction of the P li m so ll line , a mark ing which was introdu ced to prevent ins ur ance fraud invol ving inf eri or v es sels
Wh ere is the sense of crisis which gener ations before us had ?
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of c er ti fication that Mrs R oth - B eh r end t speak s about , the i d enti fication in the form of gre en mark s on t ank ers which certain h ar bour s in Europe have brought up for discussion
We must also critic ally exam ine the cl as si fication soci e ti es. I do not think that we can accept their proced ures
We need independent proced ures and proced ures invol ving public control
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provid es environmental aid to ship own ers who wish to improve the quality of the environment , there are un it s within the Commission who regard this as pro h ib ited aid to ship y ard s
With in the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing
It is not an accept able procedure that measures to improve the environment , which are in keep ing with the Commission' s guidel in es, cannot be taken because these are considered to constit ute pro h ib ited aid to ship y ard s
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the G U E / N G L Group resolution because it d en oun ces T ot al - F in a ' s responsibility in this ec ological disaster and I end or se the proposal that fla g s of con ven i ence and the use of su per ann u ated v es sels should be pro h ib it ed, or that dou ble h ull s should be m and atory for oil t ank ers
I shall only add that it would be the least that T ot al could do to comp ens ate for the direct and ind ire ct damage caus ed by the oil s lic k
How can we st op sim ilar disast ers occ urr ing in future if we do not ins tit ute dra con ian measures against the major oil cor por ations, and indeed many others who , in order to make more pro fit , take the risk of making the world un in h ab it able ?
How is it possible not to be out ra ged when a b ank ref us es to di v ul ge the n am es of the E ri k a ' s own ers on the ground s of prof ession al confid enti ality , without governments re ac ting ?
The cru x of the problem is that all government s, and indeed all the European institution s, ac know ledge the right of major cor por ations such as T ot al - F in a and its i l k to m ax im ise pro fit s whether it be harm ful to their employ ees or to the environment
They accept the prof ession al confid enti ality of business and b ank s, even though this same confid enti ality s er ves to con ce al what are ess enti ally criminal actions
In these circ um stan ces, even the best resolution s will remain little more than appe als to principle which are power less to limit the great cor por ations ' cap ac ity to cause damage
Mr President, I am in favour of t ight ening up the legislation on p ort state control and on cl as si fication soci e ties
However, we must s tic k to the fact s
The ship E ri k a has been inves tig ated four tim es in the course of the last two years
The answer cannot li e in the number of inves tig ations but rather in guarantee ing the r ig our with which the control s are undert ak en
I have he ard in the course of the discussion s that have taken place in the last few wee ks that the Member States do not have enough money to undert ake the control s
I cannot accept this
If the Member States dec ide , in agreement with ourselves , that 2 5 % of ship s are to be mon it ore d on the basis of p ort state control , then they must also make the necessary person n el available
The control s must also be carried out in such a way that the ins pect or does not just go on bo ard and chec k whether there are any f ire ex ting u ish ers mis s ing, rather there must be materi als t es ting , for this ship obvious ly bro ke up on account of materi al fa tig ue
This can only be det ect ed if control s undert ak en are more r ig or ous
It should be our go al to ensure that p ort state control s are not su per fic ial , but include materi als t es ting
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner ' s obs erv ations and would like to encoura ge her to continue down this p ath
If it should become app ar ent that one or more cl as si fication companies have provided report s by way of favour s then they should be st ru ck off the list of author ised cl as si fication companies
That is the only deter r ent we have for pre ven ting other cl as si fication companies from following su it
Mrs R oth - B eh r end t , we already have a T Ü V ( or gan isation for safety t es ting ) for ship s in the form of the cl as si fication companies
There are rep ut able companies too
You will be fam ili ar with some rep ut able compan ies, our French fe llow M E P s will be fam ili ar with some rep ut able compan ies, but we must look careful ly at exact ly which companies do not fulf il require ment s, and these must be st ru ck off the list
Finally, we should make it quite pl ain to M al t a that if it want s to become a Member of this Community then by the time it ac ced es it must apply a standard in respect of reg ist ration and fla g state control which completely fulf il s our require ment s, for the environment is a commun al en tit y and not something that we can di vid e up !
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner
Ha ving sp ent a lot of time at se a myself I am well aware of the se a 's power and d est ru ctive force , which make a proper design and main ten ance of ship s and bo at s essential
I would like to express my sy mp ath y with all those who are deal ing with the consequ ences of the b re aking up and s ink ing of the oil t ank er E ri k a
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a dep l or able w ast e of resources
It should be not ed that the oil industry , through the Intern ational O il P o ll ution C om p ens ation Fund s, regards itself as li able under the 1 9 6 9 Con vention and its 199 2 Pro t oc ol , for over 9 0% of the es tim ated cost of this in cid ent, or some U S D 1 7 0 million
This suggest s to me that we should also look to the ship own ers, to the fla g state and the ins pe ction authorities to should er their share of the responsibility
However, before we r us h in with a whole ra ft of new measures and new regul ations, let us look careful ly at the existing ar r ange ments to be sure that they are being proper ly implemented
B et ter to he ed call s to amend and improve existing legislation than to em b ark on new proposals
In that context I support call s to strengthen p ort state control to ensure full and effective ins pe ction
I support call s to ensure that the cl as si fication soci e ties effective ly monitor v es sels ' structural conditions and are held account able for their actions
C all s for design improve ments in h ull con struction , especially dou ble - h ull ed v es sel s, are sen sible but take time to be implemented throughout the fle et
They are no sub s tit ute for r ig or ous reg ular ins pe ction
Mr President, I would like to thank my Social ist colleagues , main ly in the comm itt ees on transport and the environment , who have not for g ot ten that this disaster also affect s the fish ing industry
B ec ause , as well as the ir re p ar able damage to the environment , the damage to the ec os y stem and l os s es in the to ur ist industry , the oil s lic k deal t a h uge b low to the fish ing industry , to the cons erv ation of mar ine resour ces, and the dam aged co ast l ines will take years to rec over
It is no ac cid ent, Commissioner, that the affect ed areas are always those European regions which are least develop ed, those which e ke out a me ag re exist ence from to ur ism and fish ing and which, in the majority of cas es, do not have any other resources
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the dis res pect ful activities of certain ship own ers who emp ty the b il g es of their v es sels off their co ast s, without any control what so ever
I come from a region , G al ic i a, which has su ffer ed sim ilar ac cid ents in the past
Br itt an y and G al ic i a, two European ' L and s E nd s ' , fall con st ant pre y to the ir res pon sibility of those who pre fer not to comp ly with safety regulations and transport c r ud e oil in v es sels which in themselves constit ute potential oil s lic ks
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two way s
On the one hand, by ask ing the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fish ing industry , to implement special measures to comp ens ate for the effects of this c at ast ro p he on the industry in the areas affect ed, and also by ask ing them to demand , of international bod ies and of themselves , t ight control s on ship s which sa il under fla g s of con ven i ence
In this regard , the current process of negotiations on M al t a ' s ac ces sion to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country r ig or ous ly mon it ors the oil t ank ers which sa il under its fla g
On the other hand, pre vention is essential
Portug al is a country which has clearly demonstr ated its sen si tiv ity to issues relating to the se a
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to stud y the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the pre vention of maritime ac cid ents at European level , using all the means at our disp os al - techn ological , structural and soci o - ec on om ic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happen ing again in the future
L ast ly, Mr President, I would like to high light the work carried out by the vol un te ers and local author ities, who remind ed me of old tim es when , as the then M ay ore s s, I li ved through sim ilar situ ations
We must thank those who , while def ence less and lack ing in resour ces, have b at t led c oura ge ous ly against the g ra ve effects that this disaster has had on co ast al regions, the mar ine ec os y stem and European fish ing st oc ks
Mr President, as ch air man of the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner L o y ol a de Pal a ci o, for her re action to this in cid ent, which has really sh ak en the whole of Europe
We , as the Committee on Transport , are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at se a and, of course, we are like wise prepared to discus s, at a l ater d ate, the legal imp lic ations of this communication
In addition , I should like to make a number of comments :
First , the Commission was right to concentr ate its inves tig ation on the liability of R I N A , the It al ian sh i pp ing reg ister , because we need to know if Community law was appli ed
That should be the st ar ting point for our efforts
Secondly, ap art from the ship own ers ' liability , it would be a good idea in such cases to exam ine the liability of the ch arter ers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for caus ing ec ological disast ers like this and, of course, for rest or ing the damage
On ce we have done that, our re action to the ec ological disaster is fully jus tif ied
However, this should not lead us to acc use the whole m er ch ant mar ine , which is an important sector of the econom y, cover ing as it does 1 / 3 of transport require ment s, which is why our re action needs to be measure d : str ict , but correct
I have no objec tion to exam ining an amendment making Community law str ic ter but, as other members have stress ed, we need to start with applic ation, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not l ose s ight of that fact
This legal framework is fa ir ly adv an c ed, at least if you comp are it with what is happen ing at world w ide level and the Member States, under the superv ision of the Commission, should end e a vour to ensure that Community law is actually appli ed
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortun ate in cid ent invol ving the E ri k a should in fact, as others have said this after n o on , constit ute a dec is ive w at ers h ed which will see the end to this type of ac cid ent in the European Union where , since 1 9 6 7 , there have been se vent een ac cid ents invol ving large oil t ank ers ; more than one every two years
The economic and social damage , which we have sp ok en about today, in terms of the l os s of jobs and fish ing and to ur ist resour ces, is so great that they fully jus tif y dec is ive and th or ough action on the part of the Community institutions
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the spe ed y response of your dep art ment to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented
I tr ust that these measures will , in a few month s, give r ise to a clear and conv in cing legal instrument - a directive , pos sib ly - which will put an end , once and for all, to these 2 1 st C ent ur y p ir ates , who de pri ve us all of the we alth and be a ut y of the se a
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues
I am refer ring to the dou ble h ull , which cons ists of two l ay ers of steel , with contain ers di vid ed into two t an ks
Commissioner, there are many exper ts who consider that the dou ble h ull is not su ffic i ently saf e and propose the so -c all ed ' ec ological h ull ' in which case, in the event of an ac cid ent, the se a w ater p en et r ates the contain ers and, as a result of press ure , the oil is trans fer red to other t an ks
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to op t for the saf est techn ic ally possible measures
It is therefore not su fficient to mere ly rep rodu ce the legislation in force in other countries
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard
An y cost -b ene fit analysis which t ru ly takes into account all the harm occasion ed to person s and the environment by these ac cid ent s, is b ound to support this approach
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our res pe ctive political groups has r al li ed together and expressed its feel ing s, fin ally to produ ce a joint resolution
I think that given the dra m atic circ um stan ces, and as a matter of principle , it would be i ll - ad v ised and in app ro pri ate to hold several v ot es
On the other hand, Parliament is iss u ing a resolution in one vote , for which we can see the agreement among st the various speak ers who have pre ced ed me . I think that this is an opportunity to put parliament ary press ure on the doub ts or e v asion s of a few governments and I think that we are provid ing the Commission with a power ful political act for the prepar ation of a European maritime area
I think that it is quite ob v i ou s, and this is the first conclusion that can be dra wn from the E ri k a disast er, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regul ate ch oc ol ate but do not regul ate maritime transport
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common a ir sp ace , a common ra il area and a single market , but not a common maritime area
I therefore believe that this is a project which must be open ed up with the absolute will to see it follow ed through and follow ed through in conc re te terms
The Commissioner has suggest ed three main ch ap ter s which need to be dra f ted and brought into line with our legisl ation, in which we can set standards
I have also not ed, to my great satis f action , that even the groups adv oc ating greater national so ver e ign t y, or the e uro s cep tic groups are call ing for Europe to regul ate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action
We some tim es regul ate things which could , by and large , remain subsidi ary
In this area we must respon d to public opinion
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global sc al e mere ly a p en in s ul a
Therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immedi ately with appropriate law
We must also put in place system atic control s and fin ally apply the ' p o ll ut er pay s ' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supp osed to be a deter r ent
I have al most fin ish ed and I would like to say that I have person ally reques ted a public hear ing of the Committee on Transport , which would en able us to provide an immedi ate follow - up to the E ri k a case and to suggest possible future consider ations
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hear ing
Mr President, the oil t ank er E ri k a, the own ers hip of which is v e il ed by acc omm od ation address es on M al t a and prob ably in It aly and G ree ce and which was h ire d by T ot al - F in a for the transport of oil , f ou nder ed off the B ret on co ast line , with disast r ous consequ ences
The imp lic ations for the environment and for the f l or a and fa un a of the European maritime environment are en orm ous
The cause of the disaster must be s ought in the weak en ed structure of the oil t ank er
So people are doubt ful about the safety of ship s which carry dangerous or po ll u ting goods
The Intern ational Mar itime O r gan isation has iss u ed international rules in this connection
States can carry out p ort ins pe ctions
In Europe, legislation is str ic ter and it is comp ul s ory to ins pect 2 5 % of the inc om ing v es sels according to the p ort - st ate control directive
However, it seems that n one of the Member States meet s this f ig ure due to a lack of ins pect ors
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right
Wh ere the sch e me f al ter s is in the en for ce ment of existing legislation
But how are we now going to en for ce this if there is indeed a lack of ins pect or s, est e em ed European Commission ?
C an the Commission provide an ass ur ance that Dire ctive 9 3 / 7 5 concerning min imum requirements for v es sels b ound for or le a ving Community p ort s and carry ing dangerous or po ll u ting goods will be implemented correct ly in all Member States ?
S h ould its implementation not be more str ict ly mon it ore d ?
W ould it not be bene fic ial , in the short term , following the R ot ter dam mod el , to ins pect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship ' s a ge , whether it is single or dou ble - h ull ed or whether it sa il s under a fla g of con ven i ence
In short , to give priority to old er sub - stand ard ship s over ship s which meet all quality requirements
The E ri k a was bu il t at a J ap an ese ship y ard and is single - h ull ed
There are four more s ister ship s in service at present
Con struction of this type of ship was h al ted at the time because the risk of r us ting was especially high
S ome of them also sa il under the M al t ese fla g
A re we w a iting for the next ac cid ent to happen ?
W ould s an ctions not be appropriate , as the Commissioner stat ed, for the cl as si fication soci ety ?
R I N A is currently the talk of the to wn
M al t a is enter ing the ac ces sion negotiations
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept M al t a if it is guarant e ed that the M al t ese fla g will sa il without an ac cid ent in future
I would be gr ate ful if you could be dis cip l ined since we are run ning out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Ques tions to the Commission
Mr President, just before I w ent down into the Ch am ber , I received an e -m ail with a quite em o tion al des c ri p tion from a S w ed ish w om an who had ch os en to sp end N e w Y ear ' s E ve on the French co ast in Br itt an y inst ead of st ay ing at home and c e le b ra ting with her re la tives
Li ke many other h und red s of vol un te ers, she had seen the d est ru ction , was h ed b ird s and c le an ed up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the co ast on those even ings and n ight s when they really should have been required to be there
Li ke so many other s, I too w on der where the people responsible are
Wh ere are the ship own ers and those who order the ship ments when these disast ers occ ur ?
P er haps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime
This is not the first time we have seen oil s lic k s, whether intention al or un int ention al
( T he President c ut the speak er off )
I would like to thank Mrs G ros se t ê te and her colleagues for bring ing this motion before Parliament
The environmental disaster of the s ink ing of the E ri k a off Br itt an y and the sp ill age of 1 0 0 00 t on n es of oil has been w ide ly report ed in the B ri tis h medi a
Al though B rit ain and France have had their differ ences recent ly, I can ass ure you that there is consider able sy mp ath y in my country for all those affect ed
T V p ict ures of the damage done to your co ast line and w ild life , in particular b ird s and the already d w ind ling fish st ock s, have brought back m em or ies of sim ilar B ri tis h disast ers, such as the T or re y C an y on in 1 9 6 7 , and have pro mp ted many B ri tis h vol un te ers to help
I s al ute these joint efforts to rep air the damage
This is clearly a problem for all EU co ast l ines which will require im ag in ative solution s
In st ead of allow ing the costs of these disast ers to fall on the commun ities most affect ed and ins ur ance market s such as L loy d s of L ond on , we must develop new techn olog ies to ret ri e ve from the se a much more than 1 0% of the lo st oil
There is currently little financial inc en tive for this when the ins ur ance market p ic ks up the t ab
U l tim ately, the po ll ut er must pay
In addition we must build on the Council directive deal ing with en for ce ment of international standards for ship safety and po ll ution pre vention by ens uring that the ins pe ction go al of 2 5 % of ship s call ing at EU p ort s is m et and that a high standard of ins pe ction is deli ver ed
M ore over , although I am not opp osed to ship own ers reg ister ing their v es sels in their country of ch o ice , I believe there is a need for str ic ter application of international regulations
R ather than ban ning fla g s of con ven i ence, which would vi ol ate the right of every so ver e ign state to have a m er ch ant fle et , under the 199 5 EU directive on p ort state control , national maritime authorities must imp ose more effective s an ctions on fla g states which fail to carry out their international treat y oblig ations
I s in c ere ly hope that, particularly during the French presid ency l ater this year , the Commission and the Council will look careful ly at all these op tion s, and I hear ti ly comm end this resolution to Parliament
Mr President, it feel s quite str ange to be stand ing here again today, as I have been doing at reg ular inter val s for al most t en years, and all because of an ac cid ent caus ed by human hand and by a lack of human compe t ence, and not by force maj e ure
The vic ti ms are w a iting outside
They want ans w ers
They do not want any more prom ises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through
The citizens are right to ask : " d o our regions now count among st those which are lo st fore ver ? "
Wh o will provide us with new jobs ?
When will those responsible at last understand that sp ar ing resources is not something we do for f un ; n or is it just a question of creating a system for its own s ake or a new stud y group , rather it is a joint European challenge
That is why I welcome Mrs Pal a ci o ' s action plan with open ar ms
It is equ ally important to note that " p re vention is better than c ure "
But there is an ar t to that as well
D ep loy ing the German mul ti p ur p ose ship " N e u wer k " - it is right outside my f ron t do or in C u x h a ven - ent ail ed the s w i ft provision of European ne igh bour ly help
We are particularly in the deb t of those who undert o ok the difficult dep loy ment of all their cre w
V al u able experi ences were g ain ed, and also the know ledge that we cannot m ast er such environmental disast ers using state -of- th e - art techn olog y al one
We are therefore right to demand impro ved control s, s an ctions and pre ven tive measures
I have been f igh ting for a European environmental co ast gu ard service for al most t en years, here in Parliament
The issue is as top ical as it was before
F urther more, I will not with ho ld my support but will end e a vour , al ong side my fe llow M E P s, to bring about improve ments and l og ical solution s within the framework of European and international cooperation
Mr President, first ly I would like to express my very s in c ere thank s, not only for the initiatives of the different group s, of Mrs G ros se t ê te and the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Party ( C h ris ti an Dem ocrat s ) and the European Dem ocrat s, but also for the initiatives of Mr W ur t z and the Con f eder al Group of the United Le ft / N ord ic G re en Le ft , who proposed this debate , which has l ed to a positive and important discussion
B e fore the end of Mar ch , I propose to present a communication in which I will pos sib ly present legislative text s, that is to say, amendments of specific dire ctives so that discussion s may begin in the Council and in Parliament
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem . There are m en and women who dep end on fish ing, g ather ing she ll f ish and the service or to ur ist industri es in these co ast al areas
They are environment ally sen si tive areas, but they are also sen si tive from the point of view of social development and terr itor ial equ ili b ri um . And therefore we must take the u t most care to prevent the rec urr ence of a sim ilar situation
Mrs R oth - B eh r end t said that nothing had ever been done
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do
This was demonstr ated by the Am er ic ans who , after the E x x on V al de z disast er, within one year , adopted en orm ous ly r ig or ous and to u gh legisl ation, which threat en s, as I said ear li er, to di ver t ship s unacceptable to Am er ic an p ort s towards Europe
In Europe, after the Am oc o C ad i z , or the U r qu i ol a on the S p anish co ast , in 1 9 7 6 , or the T or re y C an y on , in the same year , or the many other cases there have been , we really be gan to legisl ate after 199 4 and 199 5 , particularly in the last few years
D uring these years, the emphas is has main ly been on the safety of pass eng er transport
That is the reality
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urg ent effort to conf ron t new problem s, also d eri ving from Am er ic an legisl ation, which emphas ise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector
I have refer red to a seri es of issues which I will l ay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appe ar ance before a special committee on this matter , or when I present the act ual initiatives in the coming months
My intention is - and I ins ist - for us to begin discussion s after the end of Mar ch , also co in cid ing with the Council of Minister s, and, of course, before the end of the six -m on th period of the Portuguese Presidency , for us to have text s to discuss
F la g s of con ven i ence are one problem , but are not the only one
The R om an ian fla g is not a fla g of con ven i ence but, never thel ess, that country has an extremely high number of in cid ences at ins pe ctions ; more than the countries with fla g s of con ven i ence
M al t a and C y pr us have asked to j o in the Community
We must be demand ing on this issue and we are negoti ating to this end
This will ob li ge us to recon sider the reg ister s in the European Union, and to deal with the not or ious problem , which will no doubt ar ise again , of the aim of a Community reg ister
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event , we should carry out a review of the reg ister s of the European Union countries
As for the ins pe ction s, very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has work ed, as Mr H at z id ak is has said
We already have legislation
A cc ord ing to the information which the Commission services have given me , this legislation is not ad equ ately appli ed in many Member States due to a lack of person n el , means and ins pect ors
The problem is not that only 2 5 % are ins pect ed, but rather how we se lect , how we find , the ship s which constit ute the high est risk , through the a ge of the ship s and the risk hist ory of the fla g s
Un fortun ately, the 2 5 % often cons ists of fla g s which are expect ed to fulf il the requirements : in this way ins pe ctions are quick er and the work is carried out more e a si ly
Therefore , more than making amendment s, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done , ap art from some supp lement ary requirements with regard to review s, especially in relation to the a ge of the different v es sels
And that is why we have S O LA S ( th e Intern ational Con vention for the S a f ety of L if e at S e a ) and M A R P O L ( th e Intern ational Con vention for the P re vention of P o ll ution from S hip s ) , two con ven tions of the Intern ational Mar itime O r gan isation which will event ually have to be made m and atory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be mon it ore d
With regard to the question of Union ins pect or s, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity jus tif ies the idea that these ins pe ctions be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their d ut y ad equ ately
L ast ly, I would like to stress the issue of liability
N ot only in terms of m ax imum su ms ins ure d , which I believe should be sim ilar to those in the United States
We have set a f ig ure of U S D 1 8 0 million ; in the United States they are talking about U S D 1 b illion as a m ax imum c e il ing for cover ing cla im s pay ments
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move clos er to level s in the United States, but that we also have to recon sider the su ms ins ure d on v es sels and, therefore, the liability of ship own ers, and also to hold li able those who ch arter ship s, which is to say the own ers of the car go
Un less we require that the own ers of the car go be held li able , we will never , in my opinion, resol ve these problems
I will end now . I will not exp and further
We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasion s
But , obvious ly, as some speak ers have said - and I thank all of you for your tot ally positive and rele vant inter ven tions - we cannot allow a situation where , within one , two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done
As for me , I can say, after having deb ated it in the C ol le ge of Commissioner s, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measure s, amendments and dire ctives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equ ip ourselves with the gre ates t possible level of safety
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Minister s
Thank you very much , Commissioner
We have taken good note of your int en tions
I have received 8 mo tions for resolution , in accordance with R ule 3 7 ( 2 ) , to close the present Commission statement
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place on Th urs day at 12 . 00 p . m
St orm s in Europe
The next item is the Commission statement on the st orm s in Europe
Mr B arn i er has the f lo or on behalf of the Commission
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ide as you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affect ed and who are ex pe c ting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them
In the day s immedi ately following this ter ri ble st orm I w ro te to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to red ra w the b ound ar ies of Objective 2 so that all areas dev ast ated by the st orm s in France and else wh ere could benefit from Objective 2
I think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it
In fact, we all know that any one who does not live within the peri m et er of an Objective 2 region will find it all but imp os sible to ob tain aid
We should therefore put this situation right immedi ately
You also know that this will not only be a short -term problem , but also a medium and long -term one
Let me explain
I was in the region of L or ra ine at the time of this ter ri ble st orm which d est ro y ed a round 2 0% of decid u ous fore st
Inde ed, for some ' fore st ry ' dist ric t s, which have lo st 2 0% of their t re es, this represent s a h uge l os s
We know , for example, that it takes between 15 0 and 200 years for a t ree to reach mat urity , so the l os s these to wn s will su ffer will not be sp read over one , two or five years, but over many more
The to wn s concerned es tim ate that it will be sp read over 4 0 years
I think that consequ ently it will be extremely difficult indeed to comp ens ate these rural to wn s through subsid ies for l os s es in their financial re ven ues
I think that this is something which we should contin ually bear in mind so that we do not l ose s ight of it in our various policies
It is true that the problem of the fore st ry sector is an extremely comple x one
Inde ed, you sp o ke of rele as ing funds for tim ber st or age on the ground s that its pr ice must not dep re ci ate
On the other hand, dist ric ts which have not been affect ed by the st orm s will also su ffer , as the N ational F ore st ry O ffice has decid ed to free z e c ut s in fore st ation for four years
Th ose dist ric ts which have not su ffer ed l os s es will therefore see their inc om es dec re ase in any case
I am tell ing you all of this to i ll ust r ate how comple x the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for ext ending their analysis of this situation as far as it could
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disast er, the real ec ological c at ast ro p hes are still to come
As you your self said, Commissioner, these disast ers or st orm s do not always have nat ural caus es, and we think that these are the first sign s of c li m ate change
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact
Mr President, everyone who has tra ve ll ed here by car , tra in or a er op l an e, has been able to see the extent of the damage , particularly in Fr ance, caus ed by h urr ic an es of a completely un p re ced ent ed vi ol ence which st ru ck Europe at the end of last month
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when fa ced with such a w id es p read disaster ?
Firstly, I would like to pay t rib ute to the may ors and local representatives who , on a d a ily basis , have had to reas s ure their constit u ent s, organ ise vol un te ers and cooper ate with the public services
They have ear n ed the confidence of their fe llow - ci ti z ens
N ext , I would like to thank the em erg ency services and the ar m ed for ces of the Union' s Member States who , in a fin e example of inter governmental cooper ation, ca me to support the efforts of their French colleagues
I would also like to consider the par ad o x ical situation we have with regard to em erg ency aid
If this disaster had taken place in G u ate m al a or Turke y, we could have immedi ately used the Community budget to help the vic tim s, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no su it able budget line with which to do so
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of business es affect ed by the disaster by apply ing Community competition rules too str ict ly
I am think ing in particular here of fish and she ll f ish compan ies, which have been particularly b ad ly h it
As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is comp ens ation for the for ced c ess ation in activ ity and that appe als can be made to F I F G for invest ments that have been tot ally w ip ed out
B ey ond this, I think that implementing M A G P s in a m ech an ical way will no longer be appropriate in the co ast al regions that have been affect ed
I therefore ask the Commission to st op doing so and, on the cont r ary , to help those who make their living from the se a to proceed to new invest ment s, which they urg ently need
Mr President, the st orm s which dev ast ated France during the n ight between 2 6 and 2 7 De ce mber have caus ed, as has been said, 9 0 de ath s and damage to a value of F F 7 5 b illion , i.e. EUR 1 1 b illion
Al most three wee ks after the disast er, several th ous and people were still without elect ric ity and te le ph on es, 5 00 0 00 h ect a res of fore st ry l and , or 1 00 million c ub ic m et res of fore st , have been r u in ed, and our hist or ical her it age has also been affect ed, as the s ad example of the par k at the Pal ace of V ers a ill es demonstr ates
It seems quite nat ural that given such a disast er, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the dev ast ated regions and those people who have been wor st affect ed
As the previous speak ers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fe llow Member , Mr Mar tin e z , with regard to another tra ged y, the f lo od s in No ve mber in the S ou th w est of Fr ance, you have certainly not ed these disast ers with concern , but all you are doing is po in ting out that the budget line for em erg ency appropri ations for nat ural disast ers has been dis con tin u ed, which has result ed in this sh ock ing par ad o x . This par ad o x , point ed out by the previous speak er, is that it is e a si er, a great deal e a si er, to offer help to vic ti ms of nat ural disast ers outside the Union than within it
We know full well that what you are do ing, Commissioner, and that is, li m iting your self to gi ving us the h y p oth e tical and rem ote possibility of bene f iting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provision al Objec tives 2 or 5 b
These are the terms of the wr itt en answer you g ave Mr Mar tin e z on 1 1 J an u ary 2000
I can show you a c op y if you wish
We would understand completely if you were not able to say any thing else given the ir res pon sible at tit ud e not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do any thing because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so
But for p ity ' s s ake , and I am not saying this to you in an ag g res sive way , ple ase do not present appropri ations which have previous ly been e arm ark ed under an un re l ated regional policy as aid for vic ti ms of the st orm s
As a matter of urg ency , therefore, we must rest ore , within the framework of a supp lement ary budget , the budget line which was alloc ated to us for nat ural disast ers
We must use the B er lin S um mit aid appropri ations and we must change the fore st ry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That , however, is another problem al t og ether
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has under g one a to u gh or de al at the start of this m ill en n ium
I would first like to express my hear t f el t con d ol ences to the fam ili es in m our ning as a result of the app all ing we ather conditions that dev ast ated Europe in De ce mber
These st orm s were an un p re ced ent ed ec ological disaster for our fore st s
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the fore st s in my region , L or ra ine , which have su ffer ed en orm ous d est ru ction
I would like to congratulate the regional author ities, the vol un te ers and the public services on the f ant as tic way in which they r al li ed r ound but, unfortun ately, their t rou b les are not yet over
It is Europe 's d ut y to support them and there b y comp lement the efforts of the governments of Member States affect ed by the disaster
I welcome Mr B arn i er ' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has ann oun ced
I am certainly not for get ting the economic di men sion of this matter , as the tim ber industry has been dev ast ated and a whole population is su ffer ing the tra g ic effects of this
The Community action programme for civil protection , established by a Council decision on 9 De ce mber , was la un ch ed on 1 J an u ary 2000
I ask Member States to gr as p this opportunity . This programme must work at full cap ac ity
Al though it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the s in c er ity of Commissioner B arn i er ' s words - unfortun ately it is still in its inf an cy when it comes to fore st ry
Our priority , as we w a it for Community - le vel funds to be f reed up , is for materi al aid in terms of partnership exch ang es between Member States
It is therefore a matter of urg ency to improve fore st road s, and to rep air them as quickly as possible
L ending fore st ry equ ip ment and making person n el qu al if ied in fore st ry management available are also cover ed by this measure
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occ urr ence of ph y t os an it ary problems which could result from having to ab and on large amount s of w o od in the fore st , and from the po ll ution of ground water through having to st ore such large qu an ti ties of w o od
Finally, it is essential that we s low down the l og g ing of stand ing w o od , in order to give priority to the pur ch ase of w ind f all s
These tim ber s al es should be support ed by strong medi a cover age in Member States
This aid for g ather ing tim ber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid p ack age , which will take the form of aid for re fore st ation and aid for the development of rural areas
I ask the Commission to incorpor ate this into a stud y of how the situation should be man aged now that the em erg ency is over
This is a very s ad opportunity for Europe to renew its fore st ry her it age in line with the role that this play s in w ild life and nature cons erv ation and in our econom ies
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ec ological and economic c al am ity
If this solidarity is to have been worth wh ile , it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for saf eg uard ing the tim ber industry
H urr ic an e " L oth ar " should pro mp t us not to ab ide so le ly by the principle of undert aking rep air s once the damage is done - something which is discuss ed at a very su per fic ial level here - , but to s w it ch to the precautionary principle , under the terms of which potential per pe t rat ors are brought to bo ok too
C urr ent programmes must be ac ce ler ated
For example, as they stand , the Commission' s programmes will prec lud e us from meeting our oblig ations under K y ot o
The trade in em ission s rights is imm or al to my mind and rather than s ol ving the problem , it sh el ves it
The entire tax ation system must be given an environmental pers pe ctive in the medium term
We must work more r ap id ly towards achie ving the t ar get s sti pul ated in the White Paper for renew able energy sour ces, as this would bring about a m as sive redu ction in gre en h ouse g as es
The new Commission has not put forward ne ar ly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is w o e ful ly in ade qu ate !
Commissioner, Mr President, L oth ar was a quite or d in ary na me h ither t o
However, it has now achie ved not or i ety
The h urr ic an e of the same na me s w ep t ac ross Europe cla im ing num erous vic tim s, main ly in France and German y, but also in S w it z er land , le a ving a tra il of d est ru ction in its w ake
The w ind t ri u mp h ed over elect ric ity p yl on s, ro o f s, tra ffic sign s and, u l tim ately over the fore st
We have he ard that in a short sp ace of time the st orm left us with appro x im ately 12 0 million c ub ic m et res of solid tim ber , and this is only an es tim ate
I have list en ed to you very att en tive ly Commissioner, and welcome with open ar ms the fact that you are intend ing to go and see for your self the effects the c at ast ro p he has had in France and in German y
If Mrs Sch re y er is to vis it the B la ck F ore st some ti me in the next few day s, then any one farm er might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual
What would you say to the fore st ry man ag er if his enter pr ise happen ed not to be in an Objective 2 region , or in a 5 b region ?
What answer will the Commission give , when it is on the sc ene , when you tell the fore st ry work er that we support road con struction and dam -b u ild ing, and we want to re b u ild our cultural her it age and create to ur ist att rac tions e t c . ?
All this is well - int ention ed adv ice
However, I come from an area in N ort her n German y where the fore st ry industry pre d om in ates and I can tell you that we are already feel ing the effects of the im men se damage
The th in ning - out we need is not being att end ed to ; the fore st s are not being t end ed to the requ is ite de g ree
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urg ency is to appro ve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a l ater d ate
Mr President, Commissioner, per mit me , first of all, to make reference to two fact s
Firstly, at the begin ning of 1999 , N A T O , with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, f l at ten ed Kosovo with b om b s in the na me of freedom
We are now end e a vour ing, at h uge cost , to get the country back on its fe et again and help its people , and right ly so
Secondly, at the end of 1999 un b e lie v able st orm s r aged bring ing de ath and d est ru ction to v ast tra ct s of the EU
The Commission in Brus sels respon d ed to the vic ti ms ' cri es for help with a sh ru gg ing of should ers
" W e do not have the where w ith al for that, " they said
This is wr ong !
And no one can compreh end this at tit ud e
C ertain ly those who fear for their live li ho od are at a complete l os s
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity , also from within this Community
I say they have a right to solidarity
Inde ed the European Parliament must make it its business to up ho ld this right in h our s of need
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the vic ti ms of the st orm s
It know s the ins and out s of aid provision better than any local organ isation or authority
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bring ing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brus sels offic es are lack ing is not so much the where w ith al for provid ing aid as the good will
P er mit me one further com ment. Al though it was less e vid ent in the case of the consequ ences of the st orm , the t ank er disaster off the French co ast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a help ing hand on another matter
The European Union needs rules govern ing environmental liability as a matter of urg ency
We can no longer to ler ate a situation where the general public has to fo ot the b ill for damage that has often been caus ed by individual s involved in criminal m ach in ations
We must make the per pe t rat ors li able for all man ner of damage done to our environment
Th en, for example, people will think tw ice before transp or ting oil in a t ank er that is about to fall ap art
Wh en, in 199 4 , over five years ag o that is, I j o ined the L eg al Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I bec a me rapporteur for the environmental liability do s si er
To this day I am still aw a iting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually en able me to start work
It is a sc and al ous state of affair s that must be end ed with all ha st e, and I hope that F e b ru ary does not see this do s si er being post pon ed yet again !
Mr President, Commissioner, the st orm s that to ok place at the turn of the m ill en n ium should g al v an ise us into think ing about certain problems
It has become clear that man k ind contin ues to be un able to avoid nat ural disast ers
There have always been nat ural disast ers and there always will be
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here
There is certainly a need for European civil protection , and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line cover ing nat ural disast ers
But , most important ly, it is only ever man that makes the m ist akes as far as the nature - man k ind relations hip is concerned - despite the fact that the same m ist akes have often been made down through the cent ur ies - and never nature , for nature cannot make m ist akes
The extent of the damage caus ed on this occasion was deter min ed by the population d ens ity , the type of inf ra st ruct ure , and, of course, the many mon oc ulture s, if we are talking fore st s
Of course, I am in favour of provid ing assistance where we can
But when it comes to aid , we o u ght to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphas is should be pla ced on l ay ing elect ric ity and te le ph one c abl ing under g round
We must take account of small er c y c les and pl ant st able m i x ed w o od land when undert aking re fore st ation, rather than mon oc ult ures
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the c li m ate
To this day , we in Europe remain in the priv ile ged position of having the G ul f St ream , and the G ul f St ream still does its st u ff
Am er ic a and s ou th - e ast A si a are having a much wor se time of it as far as c li m ate and st orm s go
We are for t un ate in having the G ul f St ream
But in common with other s, we too are having to end ure the gre en h ouse effect
This is part ly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstr ate c li m ate change using c al cul ations
We must take more account of the guidelines produ ced at the K y ot o environmental con ference
We must redu ce C O 2 em ission s, employ renew able energ ies, and gener ally make en qu i ri es, in this connection , as to how the fore st s of Europe are far ing
Mr President, I think we should first ly express our s orrow for the vic ti ms
This is an ir re p ar able l os s
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French dep art ments and citizen s, and the solidarity of other countries with Fr ance, which is the country wor st affect ed
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to to uch upon two ele ments of our resolution
I believe that the first one was imp lic it ly recogn ised by the Commissioner in his speech when he w on der ed whether these c at ast ro p hes are nat ural or not
That is to say that exper ts are ever more conv in ced that c li m ate change and human activ ities, in general term s, are link ed to the increase seen in nat ural disast ers in recent years
In fact, over the last dec ade , the te mp er at ure has ris en more than in the rest of the cent ur y
Therefore Europe must be clearly comm itted to the K y ot o Pro t oc ol and make specific proposals
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner ' s proposal to create a European civil protection bod y
F urther more, we should u til ise an ext ra ordin ary budget line , since this is an ext ra ordin arily c at ast ro ph ic situation
First of all, we would like to express sy mp ath y with all the fam ili es and commun ities that lo st members in this ter ri ble tra ged y
It is really the l os s of life that makes this particular disaster an ext ra ordin ary one by European standards
It is regret t able that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situ ations like this
I want to thank the Commissioner for his compreh ensive statement on the subject and his sugg es tion that we might indeed organ ise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tra ged ies like this
That is important
The other thing we should re me mber is that we did have a budget line in the past . It was very small
It was not able to do very much but it was repe ated ly ab us ed by Members of this House propos ing action when the disast ers were not even major
O ffic ial s and min ister s from Member States were coming to Brus sel s, wh is per ing with the Commission and get ting a few e uro s and making a political point by bring ing aid back to their constit u en ci es
So there was not much sy mp ath y for this budget line when it was ab ol ish ed
I think we should re in st ate this budget line
When we had the ear th qu ake in G ree ce , which was a b ig disast er, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sy mp ath y or solidarity to the G ree ks
The same when the f lo od s ca me in France and the same again now
These are major disast ers, we should have an instrument , we do not have it
We should re in st ate that instrument and we should make the rules t ight so that only in situ ations where g ra ve disast ers occ ur will we call up this particular instrument
We can sa ve it from year to year and ensure that when something major happ ens we have an instrument to deal with it
We did not have it so b ad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious w ind st orm s on the At l an tic
We had f lo od s in Ireland also and I want to express my sy mp ath y with the people in Ireland who su ffer ed from these
L adies and gentlemen, n one of us must for get what has taken place
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seek ing to dis con tin ue em erg ency l ines
It is also true that there is a lot of European money a round . Commissioner B arn i er has point ed out that o y ster farm ing and agric ulture would be elig ible under Article 3 0 of the regulation concerning rural development, fore st ry would be elig ible under Article 3 3 , companies would be elig ible under ex emp tions from the competition law st ated in Article 8 7 ( 2 ) of the Treaty and public fa cili ties would be elig ible under the Structural Funds
It is never thel ess the case that not a p en n y more than what was alloc ated before the st orm will now be f reed up to demonstr ate practical , active solidarity
It is nothing more than the States play ing at taking from P et er in order to give to P a ul
This is in ade qu ate, and I am person ally de light ed that Mr B arn i er has st ated an idea close to my hear t and which, more over , I expressed when I to ld the press in B ord e au x what I am h op ing for , and that is the establish ment of a re in for ced policy of European civil security
If the European citizens hip that we all want to see is to come into being , if the m and ate that our President, Mrs F on tain e has st ak ed on a clos er relations hip between the Union and Europe ' s citizens is to be effective , our citizens must be able to feel that we are ac ting with some urg ency
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force , real civil re lie f b l ue hel m et s, who would go to areas in difficult y within the Union, as we currently have no em erg ency procedure , but also outside the Union if needs be , in V ene z ue la or any wh ere else , is something that we should hope to see
I would like to tell Commissioner B arn i er that in me he has an active al ly for this idea which st ri k es me as no ble and t ru ly European in spirit
Mr President, Commissioner, when we comp are the f re qu ency with which st orm s occ ur in other part s of the world with our own situ ation, we see that Europe get s off re lative ly light ly
N ever thel ess, the st orm s that to ok place in the last week of De ce mber show ed us what the consequ ences can be and that there are major problems in st ore for us
An y one tra ve ll ing to St r as bour g by car or by ra il would have been able to see for themselves that st orm s r aged in Al s ace as well
I would therefore like to extend my sy mp ath y to all those citizens in the regions where the st orm s r aged so f ur ious ly, and at the same time, from my position here in this Ch am ber , point to how important it is to support these regions and people
E ach and every one of us know s that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a f ate tomorrow
What we need to do now is to deal with the fall en tim ber as s w i ft ly as possible
For it is common know ledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hand s if the fall en tim ber were to be left in the fore st s too long
For inst ance, it should be point ed out that fall en tim ber provid es the best b reed ing ground for the b ark be et le ' s l ar v a e, and we are not yet in a position to assess the rep erc us sion s this will have
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fall en tim ber before the w arm er we ather ar ri ves
D ec ad es will have g one by before we are able to deter min e the true extent of the damage sustain ed by the fore st ry industry
For we all know how long it takes a t ree to grow
The c al cul ations are in dec ad es rather than years
In addition , I would like to point out that the fore st ry industry is certainly not just about tim ber produ ction , for b ar ri er w o od land and w o od land that act s as a sh ield against av al an ch es also constit ute an important fact or in certain regions
I am therefore very p rou d to say that the s k ill ed Austrian fore st ry work ers are also prepared
( T he President c ut the speak er off )
Mr President, I extend our de ep est sy mp ath y to all of those who were affect ed by the st orm s
S ome tim es within the Community we do not actually have an aw ar en ess of what is happen ing in other countries
We had very little cover age in Ireland of the t ank er that s ank
I was asked to high light the result of the st orm s in Ireland
We had high w ind s and un p re ced ent ed, pro l ong ed r ain f all which, add ing to existing difficul ti es, result ed in th ous and s of ac res being sub m erg ed, some tim es, in up to 15 fe et of water
We experi en ced the human mis er y of f lo od ed h om es and farm s, no s an it ation, no d r ink ing water and the environmental disast ers of E . c o li -in f ect ed water
I talk ed with farm ers whose e w es were ab or ting their l am b s due to d r ink ing the inf ect ed water
N at ural ha b it at s were d est ro y ed
So I ask that Ireland be re me mber ed in this particular case
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the st orm vic ti ms
I would just like to point again to the imp act on the fore st ry industry throughout Europe
For the st orm s will have major imp lic ations for the fore st ry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need , in the long -term , to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be deal t with in future
We certainly do not want market organ isation for fore st s, but may b e we should set up a system , perhaps in con j unction with the priv ate ins ur ance sector , which will make it possible to m iti g ate the imp lic ations for the vic ti ms in some way
Un fortun ately, we can expect there to be repe at perf orm an ces of this kind of major disaster in the future
As has already been mentioned here , there are indic ations - no pro o f , but clear indic ations - that the increase in st orm s world - w ide has to do with the c li m ate c at ast ro p he
Of course, the scienti st s do not all see e y e to e y e on this yet , but the majority of them are fa ir ly conv in ced that if we continue to e mit gre en h ouse g as es as we are do ing, these st orm s will , of course, h it us much hard er still at the d a wn of this new cent ur y
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Ch am ber by a form er fe llow M E P of our s, T om S p en c er. He suggest ed that rather than gi ving st orm s the n am es of m en or women , we should na me them after the per pe t rat ors of the gre en h ouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time
However, an excep tion should certainly be made in the case of S he ll and B P , for they have chang ed policy and do not just b ase their s al es on f os si l f ue l s which are dam ag ing to the c li m ate, rather they also invest in for ms of energy that have future vi ability
We must be aware of this connection ; I do not support those who make s w eep ing state ments to the effect that the gre en h ouse effect is to b la me for this st orm , but one thing we can be re lative ly certain of is that we have reason to fear further c at ast ro p hes if we do not soon al ter our course !
I have received se ven mo tions for resolution s tabled purs u ant to R ule 3 7 ( 2 ) of the R ul es of Pro ced ure
That conclud es the debate
The vote will be taken at no on on Th urs day
F o od safety
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of out l ining to Parliament the main l ines of the Commission' s White Paper on food saf et y, adopted on W ed n es day last , 12 J an u ary , in as soci ation with my colleag ue , Mr Li i k an en
At my hear ing last S ep t ember , I prom ised spe ed y deli ver y of this White Paper
I am happ y that we have been able to deli ver so quickly
The White Paper represent s three to four months of int ensive work since the new Commission was app oint ed last S ep t ember
It takes on bo ard the ext ensive consult ations of the past c ou p le of years since the Commission' s G re en Paper on food law was p ub lish ed
E qu ally it ref lect s our experi ences of recent food al er ts in such areas as di o x in and s lud ge , as well as the B S E crisis
The White Paper also ref lect s the concerns of this Parliament which you have out l ined to both President Prodi and myself on the num erous occasion s we have deb ated food safety in this House since the Commission was app oint ed
I do not need to remind you that consum er confidence in Europe 's food safety reg ime has been b ad ly affect ed by the cris es and al er ts of recent years and months
The Commission is fully comm itted to rest or ing that confidence by put ting in place the most up - t o - d ate and effective food safety reg ime in the world
When I la un ch ed the White Paper last week I said that the sh o pp ing t rol le y is one of the most pot ent we ap ons on the face of the ear th
The most disc ern ing decisions are made by the consum ers of Europe
If their confidence is dam aged this is ref lect ed in sh o pp ing decisions
This in turn has a dra m atic effect on farm ers, produ c ers and industry gener ally
In an industry worth some EUR 6 00 b illion ann u ally, even a s light di p in confidence level s can have significant effects
B et ween the ag ro -f o od sector and the farm ing sector there are over 1 0 million employ ees
H igh level s of confidence are necessary to bo ost job number s and competi tiveness
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortun ate but in e v it able effect of e ro d ing the tr ust of consum ers in the system s and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and ass ure the high est standards of food safety
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe never thel ess has one of the best food industri es in the world and also one of the saf est food control system s
The challenge is to make the system the very best
The over all objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and struct ures that will guarantee the high est possible level of health protection for consum ers ar ising from the cons u mp tion of food
We are set ting out a chall eng ing and amb iti ous agenda for change
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our amb i tions on sch ed ule
We will also need the full est support from the Council and other key st ake ho ld ers
The White Paper on food safety out l ines a compreh ensive r ange of actions needed to comp lement and modern ise existing EU food legisl ation. All of these measures are design ed to make it more co her ent, understand able and flex ible
We want to promote better en for ce ment of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consum ers
The detail ed action plan on food safety in the White Paper set s a precise tim et able for action over the next three years
O ver 8 0 measures are env is aged
Our objective is to put in place a co her ent and up - t o - d ate bod y of food law by the end of 200 2
We are also env is ag ing the establish ment of a European food authority by 200 2 as an essential comp lement to the new food safety reg ime
This idea will be the focus of much sc ru tin y and debate
It has already att ra ct ed much comment , including re ac tions from Members of Parliament
The ch ap ter of the White Paper dev oted to the establish ment of a European food authority is clearly design ed to e lic it views and comment s. We are seek ing views by the end of A pri l on what we env is age
I will ret urn to this process of consult ation in a few mom ents
The Commission belie ves that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the tw in objectives of ass uring the high est standard of food safety and rest or ing consum er confidence
Wh y should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?
The first key concern is independ ence
K ey st ake ho ld ers, including consum ers, are seek ing a system that is independent and per ce i ved to be independent of all v est ed interests
We must also ensure excell ence and transparency
We have made a lot of progress over the past c ou p le of years since the reform ed system of scientific adv ice was adopted as a consequ ence of the B S E crisis
However, the Commission belie ves that we must go further
We must create a per man ent and t ru ly independ ent, excellent and transpar ent system of risk assess ment
The key task of the authority will be risk assess ment in the area of food safety
We env is age that the work of the existing five S ci enti fic Comm itt ees dev oted to food safety will be trans fer red to the authority
They may not be trans fer red in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will e lic it views before making our defin i tive proposals on the authority 's establish ment
However, if we were mere ly to propose a simp le mo ving of dec k ch air s, this would clearly not be enough
As the White Paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value - ad d ed structure
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific adv ice needs to be strengthen ed
With in the authority I env is age much strong er scientific and other support for the independent scienti st s
I am also env is ag ing that the authority will be much more pro ac tive than our current reg ime - anti cip ate rather than re act , i d enti f y issues before they become cris es
This pro ac tive approach should become the h all mark of the authority
To be pro ac tive the White Paper i d enti f ies a number of new areas that would be em b ra ced by the authority
These include a compreh ensive information g ather ing and sur ve ill ance function , the coordin ation of scientific information in the EU , and build ing up strong net wor ks with food safety ag en ci es and bod ies in Member States
As part of its re mit we also env is age the authority oper ating an en h an ced r ap id al er t system for food and fe ed concerns
The Commission has decid ed that it is ne ither appropriate n or fe a sible to dev ol ve risk management power to the authority
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should proper ly remain the pres erve of the Commission, Parliament and Council
I make no ap olog y for this approach ; I firm ly believe that it is the correct one
C ertain ly there are those who would ar g ue that we should give law -m aking po w ers to such an authority
I do not accept those views and reject them with some de g ree of p as sion
It was only last year that the Treaty was amend ed to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view, a ret ro gra de step and represent a d il ution of democratic account ability
I will be very interest ed to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter
There are also those who ar g ue that the Commission could effective ly i gn ore the adv ice of the new authority
I also reject this line of argu ment. How could a Commissioner for He alth and Con s um er Pro t ection reject or i gn ore well -f ound ed independent scientific adv ice in relation to food safety ?
W ould this be in the interests of Europe 's citizens ?
In my view, most defin ite ly not un less such re jec tion of the scientific argu ments were s ound ly bas ed, r ation ally argu ed and fully jus tif ied
It seems difficult to env is age such a situation e v ol ving
I can ass ure you here today that the Commission, in ex erc ising its risk management function s, will fully take account of the scientific adv ice of the authority
I have already said that the authority will be ch ar ged with develop ing net wor ks with national food safety ag en ci es and bod ies in the Member States
This is a major task
We must develop greater certain ty in the sci ence that under p in s food safety in the European Union
The authority must become the author it ative sour ce of scientific adv ice and information on food safety issues
This situation will not come about by the very cre ation of the authority but will e v ol ve over time as confidence is g ain ed in the authority itself
I do not believe we can be pres c ri p tive in the area of sci ence and adv ice based on sci ence
However, with the e v olution of d y n am ic net wor ks with national scientific bod ies and ag en ci es, the authority will become pre - em in ent on the European stage
I am also an x ious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard
As an integr al part of a value - ad d ed structure , the White Paper propos es that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to dis se min ate comple x scientific information in a consum er -f ri end ly way ; to be the obvious and ind is p ens able p ort of call for the most up - t o - th e - min ute d at a on risk ; to be high ly vis ible ; to tell the good new s st ory about food ; to be pro ac tive
The White Paper also contain s very important proposals in respect of control s
This is a h uge ly important comp on ent of the system of chec ks and bal an ces to ensure that Member States and oper at ors are comp ly ing with Community legislation
I want to see a g en u ine internal market oper ating in the control ar en a
In this context we are also propos ing to strengthen significant ly the control function carried out by the food and v et er in ary offic e loc ated in D ub lin
This rev ised Community framework would have three c ore ele ments : oper ational criteria set up at Community level , Community control guidel in es, and en h an ced administ ra tive cooperation in the development and oper ation of control
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be exam ining whether addition al po w ers in addition to inf ring e ment proced ures need to be given to the Commission. These could include with ho ld ing Community financial support or rec ou p ing funding already comm itted to a Member State
These proposals must be seen as part of our m ission to have the high est food safety standards in the world , bo ost consum er confidence and increase market s for farm ers and produ c ers in the Union
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an en h an ced control system at Community - le vel , the White Paper propos es an action plan with a w ide r ange of measures to improve and bring co her ence to the Community 's legisl ation, cover ing all aspect s of food product s from farm to t able
It set s out over 8 0 s ep ar ate actions that are env is aged over the period a he ad and intend s to close i d enti f ied lo oph ol es in current legislation
The new legal framework will cover an im al fe ed, an im al health and wel f are , h y g i ene , cont am in ants and res id ues , no vel food , add iti ves , fla vour ing s, p ack ag ing and ir ra di ation
It will include a proposal on general food law which will em b od y the principles of food safety such as responsibility of fe ed manufactur ers, farm ers and food oper ator s, tra ce ability of fe ed, food and in g re di ent s, proper risk analysis through , for inst ance, risk assess ment - that is, scientific adv ice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communic ation, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate
As regards the precautionary principle , I might add that the Commission is currently final ising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon
I look forward to having a use ful exchange of views this after n o on with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have pre fer red to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliament ary for um available
However, having regard to my cont act s with the presid ents of the rele vant comm itt e es, I recogn ise that this was not fe a sible
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper 's proposals on the authority
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission' s ide as on the White Paper on the establish ment of a European food authority
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate. Parliament play ed a crucial role in Europe 's response to the B S E crisis
It has especially active since then in bring ing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore
I expect that Parliament 's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as inc is ive and con stru ctive
Wh ile we have a number of months to the end of A pri l to debate the issue and g arn er our view s, I recogn ise fully that this is also a very t ight time f ra me
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate ar r ange ments to ensure that its views can be form ul ated as quickly as possible
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament 's contribution to the sh ap ing of what would be a key comp on ent of ra ising consum er health protection to a new plan e and there b y rest or ing consum er confidence in the European Union 's food safety reg ime
The European food authority will be a key in g re di ent in the EU 's food safety reg ime in the years a he ad
It is essential that we get the m i x right
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement
I would like to welcome the di vision of l ab our that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institution s, including the Commission and Parliament
That is very much the right approach
But there is one word that I have not he ard you mention here t on ight . I hope that we can th r as h this out
We need a bod y of food law , as you have said, and we need to agree this together
It is very important that we include liability in that process
That is the one word I am talking about
The problem so far is that tax p ay ers pa id when something w ent wr ong
That cannot continue
When we have a crisis we have to clearly i d enti f y in adv ance that if there is a problem , those responsible are li able
Mr President, it is a very worth wh ile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority
My questions rel ate to the positive list for an im al fe ed
You are un c lear about this in your White Paper
What is your sch ed ule , how long will it take you to produ ce a positive list ?
When will the same requirements be appli ed to an im al fe ed and the produ ction there o f as apply to the produ ction of food and the monitoring there o f ?
The final part of my question is as follow s : when will B S E t es ting be b ind ing in all Member States ?
That is another point , i.e. the question of oblig ation, which you were some wh at un c lear on in your White Paper
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement
I think the l ines that you have set up regarding the F o od S a f ety A uth ority are a recogn ition of reality
The Member States would not accept a regul atory ag ency , so there is not very much point in your propos ing one
S ome sect ors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of fe ed and an im al fe ed ing st u ff s
However, as ch air man of a committee which look s as though it will be concerning itself al most entire ly with food over the next three years, I have to ask : if Europe has the saf est food control system , as you have said, why do we need 2 4 new dire ctives and regulations and 2 0 new amend ing dire ctives ?
Secondly, will this not comp ound the problem of over - reg ul ation from Brus sels and under - i mp lement ation in the Member States ? We look forward to a f ru it ful dialogue with you on this
Reg ard ing enlargement : what plans does the Commission have to involve the applic ant states in deb ates on these new law s, given that the Commission clearly expect s the law s env is aged in the White Paper to form part of the ac qu is commun a ut a ire by 200 3 ?
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs A her n , Mrs R oth - B eh r end t and Mrs J ack s on for their words of support in relation to the White Paper
I find that encoura g ing and I look forward to further discussion s with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised
Mrs A her n raised the issue of liability
That of course is not specifically address ed in the White Paper ex cept for the reference to the fact that we will be put ting in place provision s - and there are already some - relating to the issue of tra ce ability
On ce that is done , issues such as liability can be address ed
I have not given full and detail ed consideration to issues relating to and sur round ing questions of liability despite my back g round , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved
But I have taken on bo ard your sugg es tion and I will give it further consideration
Mrs R oth - B eh r end t asked me about establishing a positive list
That is one of the issues that we address in the ann e x to the legisl ation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for fe ed materi al
At the moment the list is, as I say, a ne g ative list and it is add ed to as required
The establish ment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the ann e x with a d ate att ach ed to it, 200 2 in fact
The r ap id al er t system for fe ed is something that we have i d enti f ied as a g ap in the legislation
R ap id al er t is there for food but not for fe ed
This is unfortun ate and it is wr ong , and we believe that it is important to i d enti f y it and to establish legislation to close that g ap and that will be done
The work in relation to B S E in Member States and the establish ment of r and om t es ting to i d enti f y level s of inf ec tiv ity in Member States is on go ing, I know that Mrs R oth - B eh r end t has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming al ong quickly but I understand it is in inter -s erv ice consult ation in the Commission and work is currently under way
I hope that the next time you ask me the question , I will be in a position to give you more detail ed information
Mrs J ack s on has focus ed on the fact that there are 2 4 new and 2 0 amend ing p i ec es of legislation and ask s whether this comp ound s over - reg ul ation
I should say that the p i ec es of legislation that we have i d enti f ied are intend ed to close g aps in existing legislation
It is not so much a matter of the establish ment of new reg im es or further regul ation, although that is part of it, but of i d enti f ying where there are g aps and lo oph ol es in the ch ain from farm to t able and clos ing them
There is a reference to applic ant states and that is something that we have in mind
St and ard s of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obvious ly of cri tical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have dra wn to the attention of Mr V er he ug en
Commissioner, the i gn or ance of certain Member States has l and ed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am a f ra id that once more I have cause to be an g ry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in att end ance, and that on the day that you present your inter es ting report
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , wh ate ver na me it goes by , will be given inf lu ence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matter s, and who will issue or d ers
Of course, we are not in a position to d ict ate any thing in terms of cont ent, but I would ins ist on Parliament re tain ing the rights accord ed it under M a ast r ich t and Amsterdam , and even ext ending them
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that f lies through Europe an on y m ous ly like a s ate ll ite ; an authority of this kind would be an ath em a to me and I hope it does not come to that
I also welcome the White Paper
But do you env is age that the F o od S a f ety Ag ency will have enough te eth to prevent something like the be ef w ar that we have had and France 's ref us al to li ft the ban ?
You mentioned the Commission being able to with ho ld grant s and subsid ies from countries who are ac ting in the way that France is ac ting
W ould you also propose that the Commission could give inter im pay ments for inst ance, sim ilar to the one that the B ri tis h farm ers are ask ing for at the moment ?
Mr President, you said during last week ' s information s ession that it was your view that any future EU food ag ency should not be loc ated on the peri p her y, but you did not mention what that peri p her y was
For example, the work of the EU un it loc ated in D ub lin has sh own that ph y s ical dist ance is no b ar ri er these day s to communication and having an effective inf lu ence on matters
It has been suggest ed that the most important tas ks of a future food authority will be to g ather , p ub lish and coordin ate d at a, make recommend ations for impro ved food saf et y, and - as you said - colle ct scientific d at a and po p ular ise that information for consum ers
All this will be man aged with the help of modern techn olog y in any area of the European Union
I would ask you on what you b ase your ide as for a loc ation ?
In relation to the make up of the authority : first of all it will employ in - h ouse scienti st s who will li a ise with and consult with scienti st s who are exper ts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a bo ard
You will no tice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the make up of that bo ard
This is an issue which I expect will be discuss ed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few wee ks and months
I env is age that the bo ard 's members hip will be made up from st ake ho ld ers or representatives of st ake ho ld ers
It s function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in S ep t ember
We have not done that yet but it will be done in S ep t ember
I do not expect that the bo ard will have any function in dire c ting the scienti st s how to do their work
That would e ro de the independ ence of the scientific adv ice
But it would have an over all re mit , particular ly, for inst ance, in reques ting the authority to inves tig ate particular areas requ ir ing research
Mr F l or en z ask s whether Parliament will have a say in that
That is an issue for consideration and discussion
There may be a number of views on that
S ome may take the view that it would be in app ro pri ate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament n om ine es - to be members of the bo ard
O thers may take the view that it would be a val u able ex erc ise if Parliament, through n om ine es or even M E P s themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be inves tig ated
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been rul ed out
Mr F l or en z also raised the question of an on y m ity
I am happ y that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high prof ile
It must be vis ible . It must be know n
Con s um ers in the European Union must know of the exist ence of the food authority
The C E O of the authority would be some b od y who ty p ic ally would be know n , who might appe ar reg ular ly on te le vision talking about issues relating to food , particularly in relation to the good new s st or ies sur round ing food in relation to n ut ri tion , di et and such issues , so that if another food crisis comes al ong consum ers will be aware of the exist ence of the authority
They will be aware that they have he ard from the authority before under other circ um stan ces and hope ful ly will have some b ed ro ck of confidence already bu il t up in the pr on oun ce ments from the authority
It is fund ament ally essential therefore that the authority is not an on y m ous
It must be vis ible
I will do every thing I can to promote that high prof ile role for the authority
Mrs L y n ne ask s whether the authority will have su fficient te eth
I su s pect that the question is focus ed on the issue of where the compe t ence of the authority begin s and end s and where the compe t ence and authority of food safety ag en ci es in Member States begin and end
There would have to be an inter action at scientific level
Q u ite clearly it is u nd es i ra ble to have situ ations develop where b y scienti st s working for , or adv is ing, the food safety authority at Community level may be in dis ag ree ment with some scientific opinion at Member State level
That is an u nd es i ra ble situ ation, we do not want that situation in the future
There are a number of things that under min e consum er confidence - lack of information is one
But information which includ es a fundamental dis ag ree ment between scienti st s on c ore issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern
We must attemp t to avoid that and establish the struct ures so as to ensure that there is a proper dis se mination of information between scienti st s, that there is full consult ation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is m and ated to seek the adv ice and opinion of independent scienti st s in all Member States and indeed may b e even be y ond , where exper ts are to be found else wh ere
O ver time, as I said a moment ag o, not only will the prof ile of the authority be raised but its exper ti se , its mor al authority will be increased and en h an ced over a period of time so that its views are ac cep ted and not chall eng ed
This situation can be achie ved over a period of time
You cannot legisl ate for consum er confidence
It is something that is ear n ed over a period of time
However, the Commission will have the possibility of see ing that the opinion s of the A uth ority on scientific matters are en for ced by way of pass ing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council
I real ise that this is a some wh at time - con s um ing ex erc ise but, non eth el ess, the establish ment of legislation ar ising out of the opinion s of the A uth ority is - I believe - the way forward
An y fail ure to comp ly with legislation is a matter that can be deal t with in the cour ts in the n orm al way
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the spe ed of response in such circ um st ance
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a fa ster response from the cour t process
In relation to grant s and subsid ies : y es, consideration has been given to that issue
It will require the adv ice of legal services and that will be s ought , particularly bear ing in mind that it may provide a spe ed y response to a fail ure to comp ly with Community law p ending a cour t rul ing
In relation to Mrs L y n ne 's question on inter im pay ments : that is a matter that might very well be address ed by Parliament as it rel ates to budget issues
Mrs My ll er then asked me about the loc ation of the A uth ority
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more like ly that the A uth ority will be loc ated c entr ally rather than on the peri p her y
I recogn ise that the F E O is loc ated in D ub lin and, although I come from that part of the world myself , I have to accept that it is not the cent re of Europe !
But the F V O is in quite a different situation from the F o od S a f ety A uth ority
The F V O is made up of independent scienti st s and v et s and so on who tra vel from some loc ation where there is an a ir port - quite clearly we have an a ir port in D ub lin
The F o od S a f ety A uth ority 's situation is quite different
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for inter action between the scienti st s involved in the F o od S a f ety A uth ority and those of us who are involved in the initi ation of legislation
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obvious ly be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the dra f ting of legislation understand clearly and perf ect ly what it is the scienti st s mean , what problems they have i d enti f i ed, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they ra ise
E qu ally, the scienti st s will wish to have some in p ut into the legal process or the policy -m aking process or the law - d ra f ting proces s, to ensure that the legislation meet s the i ll s that they have i d enti f ied
It seems to me des i ra ble for an authority of this type to be c entr ally loc ated
S ci enti st s will be employ ed in - h ouse but it will also be necessary to li a ise with scienti st s on a consult ative basis and, in those circ um stan ces, as scienti st s will have to tra vel , it is prob ably better that they move to a central loc ation, once again where the parliament ary struct ures and the Commission and Council are based
That is my jud ge ment at the moment
It may be a matter for discussion here and else wh ere and I will list en to any sugg es tions that are made but my pre li min ary conclusion is that this A uth ority should be loc ated c entr ally rather than on the peri p her y
C ol le ag ues , I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and ra ise it in the Conference of President s
If you feel that these s ession s after a Commission statement are important , I would suggest that we require more time than the h alf - h our that is alloc ated to them
On this occasion we have had six min utes of questions from the f lo or of the House and we have had 2 9 min utes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement
As you can see , h alf - an - h our is not really any thing like enough time for such a s ession
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structure d s ession with the Commission on such future occasion s
That conclud es the debate
Question T ime ( C omm ission )
The next item is Question T ime ( B 5- 000 3 /2 000 )
We will exam ine questions to the Commission
We will d ed ic ate appro x im ately one h our and f i ft een min utes to Question T ime
We will c ut back our time a little because the inter p re ter s are working today in continu ous s ession
Mr P ur v is has the f lo or for a proced ural motion
I ob ject to the fact that we are c ut ting back the time for Question T ime ; it is one of the few occasion s when back b ench ers have a ch ance to get their time on the f lo or and I do ask you to extend it to one and a h alf h our s as is on the agenda
That is the agenda and I think that we should s tic k to the agenda
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5 . 3 0 p . m. , and you can see the cl ock
I hope that we do not go on into the even ing s ession in any event
First Par t
Question No 2 8 by ( H - 0 7 8 1 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : Con struction of nuclear pl ant in ear th qu ake - pr one Turke y The two recent ear th qu akes in Turke y reg ister ing more than 7 on the R ich ter sc al e ra ise t re m end ous doub ts about Turke y 's pers ist ence with the con struction of cost ly nuclear re act ors at A k k u y u , while energy res er ves produ ced by the At at ü r k dam s are exp ort ed to third countries and the EU sp end s a s lic e of its budget on rep air ing the damage w rought by the ear th qu akes
Turke y 's nuclear plans ? which i gn ore the ris ks to the population and ec os y stem s of Turke y and the sur round ing region ? pro mp t the su sp ic ion that there are under ly ing plans previous ly deter min ed by Turke y 's political and m il it ary lead ers to ac qu ire nuclear techn olog y en abl ing them to build nuclear we ap on s, as e vid en ced by their attemp ts to bu y re act ors of C an ad ian o ri gin of the type ac qu ire d by Ind ia and P ak ist an
What step s will the Commission take to prevent nuclear ac cid ents and the pro li fer ation of nuclear we ap ons in a country that wishes to j o in the EU but sp end s en orm ous amount s on nuclear programmes while recei ving financial aid from the EU budget ?
Mr V er he ug en has the f lo or on behalf of the Commission
The Commission is following with interest the plan n ed con struction of a nuclear power pl ant in A k k u y u , Turke y and recogn ises the importance of ens uring that the con struction of the new pl ant follow s the high est intern ation ally ac cep ted nuclear safety standards
A cc ord ing to our inform ation, the decision on the se le ction of a b id der has not been taken yet
The Commission ac know led g es the fact that Turke y has sign ed and ra tif ied the con vention on nuclear safety and recogn ises that the responsibility for gr an ting l ic ences and regul ating the si ting , con struction , comm ission ing, oper ation and dec omm ission ing of nuclear power pl ants in Turke y res ts entire ly with the Tur k ish At om ic En erg y A uth ority
The Commission does not have a m and ate to imp ose any limit s on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy produ ction , including the nuclear op tion
As Commissioner W all st r ö m indic ated during the hear ings in the European Parliament in S ep t ember 1999 , the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and r ad i ation protection in any rele vant meeting with the Tur k ish Government in the future and I am happ y to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Tur k ish F ore ign Minister in a c ou p le of day s and will certainly ra ise the issue
In particular , the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the rec ord ed se ism ic activ ity in the area of the E ce m is fa ult line loc ated in the vic in ity of the proposed pl ant s ite
A cc ord ing to information received from the Intern ational At om ic Ag ency , the design of the pl ant takes into account the possibility of ear th qu akes strong er than any ever rec ord ed in the area and particularly more than t en tim es strong er than the one reg ister ed in J un e 1998 in A d an a
L arge design mar gin s are being provided in order to ensure saf e oper ation of the pl ant according to the environmental conditions of the s ite
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the pl ant to produ ce we ap ons - gra de materi al
It ac know led g es the fact that Turke y has sign ed and ra tif ied the Treaty on the N on - p ro li fer ation of N uclear We ap ons and has sub sequ ently conclud ed a compreh ensive saf eg uard s agreement with the Intern ational At om ic En erg y Ag ency
Thank you for your rep ly
I should like to make the following points : Turke y is now a c and id ate country
This plan is design ed to increase its energy potential by 2 %
At the same time, it also wishes to ac qu ire C ad ou type re act ors from C an ad a, which we now know have already been used for nuclear we ap ons in P ak ist an and Ind ia
In this sense , there is therefore a serious risk that some i di ot will dec ide that the new g e op o li tical bal ance of power in the C au c as us call s for a ne ar b y country with we ap ons g ra de nuclear techn olog y
So much for the political aspect
N ow to the technical aspect
The safety fact or in this type of project , and I am spe aking as an en g ine er, has nothing to do with increasing safety level s in relation to the risk of co ll ap se by a fact or of t en or tw ent y
In cases such as this, where there is un c ertain t y, sim ul at ors are used
However, we cannot used sim ul at ors in cases relating to nuclear energy
In this sense , all high se ism ic risk areas must be exc lud ed a prior i for nuclear inst all ations such as this
Therefore , and given that the relations hip between the European Union and the Commission and Turke y has now chang ed, it would be a good idea if Turke y discuss ed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peace ful development of Turke y within the European Union
A c ou p le of wee ks ag o we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the c and id ate countries
I have explain ed the position of the Commission
You have to accept the fact that there is no ac qu is commun a ut a ire on nuclear safety
So what we did was use political means to conv ince some c and id ate countries that we have to have dec omm ission ing plans for some re act ors that are considered not to be up gra d able
In the case of Turke y it is different
The pl ant is not yet there
I have already said that Turke y is part of the N P T and of the Con vention on N uclear S a f ety
If we see in the development of that nuclear power pl ant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turke y
If the conclusion is that Turke y is planning to build a nuclear power pl ant that does not meet n orm al European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with L ith u an i a, S lo v ak ia and B ul g ar ia
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turke y has sign ed the non- p ro li fer ation treat y, it has sign ed the nuclear safety t rea ties : why should there be any doubt at all but that Turke y 's nuclear pl ant should not be just as saf e as any in the Community , and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more r ob ust position with Mr S ou l ad ak is on this matter ?
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to ra ise his own concerns and fear s
I do not have these concerns
I believe that Turke y completely recogn ises the standards and the criteria of the con vention on nuclear safety and the non- p ro li fer ation treat y, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament
Question No 2 9 by ( H - 0 7 8 6 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : D ep le ted ur an ium we ap ons H as the Commission con du ct ed any stud ies of the potential effects upon EU states of trans b ound ary po ll ution ar ising from the use of dep le ted ur an ium we ap ons in the Koso v an conf lic t ?
If not, why not ?
Mrs W all st r ö m has the f lo or on behalf of the Commission
Thank you, Mr B ow e, for your question
The European Commission has mon it ore d the environmental effects of the conf lic t from the begin ning of the N A T O action
As ear ly as last J un e the Commission finan ced a first stud y
It was carried out by the regional environment cent re for central and e ast ern Europe and conclud ed that there had been no large -s c al e ec ological c at ast ro p he
N one of the sub sequ ent e vid ence or analysis has over t urn ed that o ri gin al assess ment
The Commission has also been close ly as soci ated with the produ ction of the recent report p ub lish ed by the United N ations environment programme - B alk an T as k For ce
This is the most detail ed and compreh ensive report to d ate on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conf lic t and I recommend it to those who have not yet stud ied it
The use of dep le ted ur an ium we ap ons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now w ide ly available also on the N et
The B alk an T as k For ce was ha mp er ed by the fact that little or no information was available on the act ual use of these we ap ons during the conf lic t
No indic ations of cont am in ation were found in Kosovo during the B T F fact -f ind ing m ission
However, this does not exc lud e the possibility that areas in Kosovo are cont am in ated by dep le ted ur an ium
F rom a des k assess ment c ou p led with a fact -f ind ing m ission the report conclud es that the risk s, if any , are limited to an area a round the t ar get
F ut ure actions will take place within the st ability p act for s ou th - e ast ern Europe
A special regional environmental recon struction plan is also being develop ed. It will form the framework for em erg ency assistance for comb ating w ar damage if such action should be needed
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very use ful response
C lear ly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these report s which have been produ ced so far have look ed careful ly at the issue
But I would like to point out that the concern with dep le ted ur an ium we ap ons is about the way in which they are used
This ur an ium bec om es a ir -b or n e, is in h al ed and could now be effective ly carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long -term effects than it has been possible to establish so far
This seems to be the p at tern of event s that has em erg ed after the use of dep le ted ur an ium we ap ons in the G ul f w ar
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continu ation of monitoring and for what l ength of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long -term effect s, not just of dep le ted ur an ium we ap ons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occ ur red at least in a local ised way within Kosovo ?
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these we ap ons ?
Thank you, Mr B ow e, for that question
We have to state again that there is still no confirm ation that dep le ted ur an ium was used in the conf lic t and no dep le ted ur an ium has been det ect ed in the c le an - up of Kosovo
But those sy mp t om s and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of dep le ted ur an ium
That is also mentioned in the report
No trans b ound ary effects have been det ect ed and most of the we ap ons will have been used on the ter rit ory of the F eder al Rep ublic of Y ug os la v ia
The problem is that the current political is ol ation of the country means that access to this area is restric ted
A b ig responsibility res ts with the United N ations because they are address ed with this report, so they have to take responsibility
But through this regional and environmental recon struction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union
It is important to follow up and it gi ves the Member States, as well as the United N ations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning m il it ary sec re ts and their effects on the environment
It also has a long -term effect on think ing when it comes to the use of these s ort s of we ap ons
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months ' time, h und red s of th ous and s of ho li day m ak ers will again he ad for the A d ri atic C o ast to sp end their su m m er ho li day
We know from medi a report s that b om b s and we ap ons were d u mp ed just off the co ast
A re you able to confirm that ho li day m ak ers will be able to s w im saf e ly in the A d ri atic this su m m er, and are there any measures in the p i pe line for as c ertain ing what the dang ers might be in this respect ?
I wish I could give guarant ees for many things but unfortun ately I am not able to
We make our jud ge ments from report s like this and the m ission s we s end to chec k on things like this
That is what we re ly on when we adv ise people on what to do
What we have seen is that w ar affect s the environment in the long term and is dangerous
In the environmental field we have just pass ed a directive on mar ine po ll ution
That also includ es b ul le ts and we ap ons and so on and it is an ear ly w ar ning system
Un fortun ately we are not able to give guarant ees and we can only continue to monitor and tr y to do the c le an - up ex erc ise
I want ed to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that so ld i ers of the N A T O ar m ed for ces now st ation ed in that region under go special control s against nuclear r ad i ation and that the same measures are not appli ed to civ ili ans living in the area ?
I cannot answer that question
When it comes to m ed ical chec ks and so on , I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer
What we know from the environmental s ide is what I have already mention ed, that there is now an environmental recon struction plan , but when it comes to m ed ical chec k - up s I do not have the information about that
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information
Question No 3 0 by ( H - 0 7 9 3 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : A pp oint ment of a European Union env o y for T ib et In 1998 the T ib et an Government in ex ile received over 4 000 T ib et ans who es c ap ed over the H im al ay an m ount ain s seek ing freedom and refuge at risk of life and li mb
M an y of the refuge es had been sever e ly f ro st -b itt en and many had di ed al ong the way
The T ib et Inter g roup is very concerned about the wor s ening situation in T ib et and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has pro ved in ade qu ate to address the g ra ve human rights ab us es fa ced by T ib et ans d a ily in T ib et
The T ib et Inter g roup , therefore, g ra ve ly concerned about the continu ing human rights ab us es in T ib et and supp or ting the D al a i L am a ? s proposal for dialogue with the Ch ines e Government to resol ve the situation in T ib et , call s on the Commission to app oint a S pe cial En vo y for T ib et to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the T ib et an and Ch ines e authorities together for dialogue
When will the Commission app oint a S pe cial En vo y for T ib et ?
Mr P at ten has the f lo or on behalf of the Commission
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about T ib et are w ide ly sh ared
I have long belie ved in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including T ib et , firm ly and c and id ly to the Ch ines e authorities
The European Union did that at the European Union ­ C h in a S um mit in Pe k ing last month where we press ed the Ch ines e on a number of human rights issues , including T ib et
We again urg ed the Ch ines e to begin a dialogue with the D al a i L am a
I urge the Ch ines e again to do so
We will continue to ra ise T ib et with the Ch ines e authorities
We are also doing a number of other things : in the European Union - C h in a human rights dialogue , we have focus ed on a number of practical step s, including s ending exper ts on as si gn ment to T ib et , planning development assistance programmes and activities focus ing on health , e du c ation and training for T ib et ans
The app oint ment of an EU special env o y for T ib et would be pri m arily a matter for the Council to dec ide and Parliament might care to take the issue up direct ly with them
But for my part , I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts
It would be un li ke ly to have much imp act on the Ch ines e authorities and we already have effective ch ann els of communication with the T ib et an community in ex ile
I am also k een to gu ard against an exp on ential grow th in the number of special env o y s, how ever worth y the cause
Mr President, Mr P at ten , of course, you are very well - qu al if ied to comment on account of the time you sp ent in Ch in a, and you are well aware of how hard the T ib et ans are tr ying to initi ate a debate , something which has always been b l ock ed h ither t o
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to " M r C F S P " , that is, to Mr S ol an a, then I fear that this would constit ute a one - sid ed approach to an ex tern al policy matter
Y our approach , which I am very much in favour of , since it is a co her ent one , takes its ins p ir ation from the issue of human rights ; I whole h ear ted ly agree that we must em b ra ce the cause of human rights
I mp ris onment , to r t ure , the m u til ation of y oun g women and so on and so forth , are defin ite ly issues that we could discuss ad inf in it um
If we c ut down here and say that the Council now sh a res responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they des erve
The possibility of stress ing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equ ation, would be a step we should take in t and em with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council
Let me make clear to the hon oura ble Member what the position is
I st ated nothing but the tr uth when I said that the app oint ment of special env o y s was a matter for the Council
As it happen s, we deal with the budget ary consequ en ces, the Council makes the app oint ment
S ome may think that the budget ary point should be look ed at in due course
P ut ting that on one s ide , because that is the situ ation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a compe t ence in human rights issues
I am very much h op ing in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produ ce a communication on human rights po in ting out , among other thing s, that there is no dis j unction what so ever between a regard for human rights in Ch in a or other pla ces in the world and the tra d ing and comm er cial interests and other interests of the European Union
I have long belie ved that we should all recogn ise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most dec ently - every wh ere in the world
I repe at that we have made our position know n to the Ch ines e on T ib et
D uring the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happen ed tw ice , first of all in N e w Y or k at our meeting with Minister T ang and most rec ently at the meeting in Pe k ing and we will continue to make that concern man if est
If I can make a l iter ary comm end ation to the hon oura ble Member , who I recogn ise is interest ed in these subject s, I recommend to him a bo ok p ub lish ed just before Ch r ist m as wr itt en by Is ab el H il t on , the dis ting u ish ed j our n al ist , on the problems of T ib et
Mr President, I would like to start my addition al question with the T ib et an g ree ting , which bet ok ens peace and happ iness
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where T ib et is concerned, rather it is about a un i q ue cultural her it age that is also able to communic ate important values such as peace , s er en ity , comp as sion - as the D al a i L am a would say - to us European s
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his H ol ines s, the D al a i L am a ' s , proposal for a peace ful solution to the T ib et affair ?
I would point out that doing nothing will be the de ath of T ib et an culture and will mean the end of the T ib et an people
I have much sy mp ath y with what the hon oura ble Member has said about cultural her it age and about the B ud d h ist tra dition
Li ke the hon oura ble Member I have read the a ut ob i o graph y of the D al a i L am a
It is an extremely mo ving account , not just of his respon sib ili ties in and towards T ib et but also of his spirit ual views as well
The Commission, like other s, has urg ed dialogue
The D al a i L am a has made it clear that peace ful dialogue is what he wishes
I wish that the Ch ines e authorities had respon d ed cons ist ently and positive ly to that over t ure from the D al a i L am a
At or a round the time of President C l int on 's vis it to Ch in a, the President of the Pe ople 's Rep ublic of Ch in a g ave the imp ression that dialogue was on the agenda
It would be very bene fic ial , not just for T ib et and for all those who believe in peace and st ability in A si a, but it would also be great ly to the cre d it of the Government of the Pe ople 's Rep ublic of Ch in a if they were to respon d to those attemp ts to begin a dialogue
Question No 3 1 by ( H - 0 7 9 5 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : Commission' s re jec tion of legislation on proper administration in the EU A cc ord ing to new sp aper report s, the Commission has reject ed the proposal by EU O mb ud s man J ac ob S ö der man for a citizens ? right to proper administration in the EU
Al though the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administ r ation, it has not now ac cep ted a detail ed proposal that has been made , but has decid ed to issue a whole set of addition al guidelines on impro ving service
A re these report s acc ur ate ?
What is the reason for the Commission ? s ac ting in this way , and how can it explain the result ant disc re p an cy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration ?
Do es the Commission consider that what has happen ed is comp a ti ble with the five - p oint programme ag reed between Parliament and the Commission in S ep t ember , and is it prepared to sub mit a detail ed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allow s Parliament to express an opinion on it ?
Mr P at ten has the f lo or on behalf of the Commission
The new sp aper report s that the hon oura ble Member made reference to seem to me to be mis le ad ing and in ac c ur ate
In No ve mber 1999 the Commission approved at first read ing a cod e of good administ ra tive beh av i our to be incorpor ated into its R ul es of Pro ced ure
At the moment the Commission is cons ul ting its sta ff representatives on the document , a process which will be final ised in the forth coming wee ks
The Commission will then adopt the cod e at second read ing
It should be not ed that the new Commission g ave an immedi ate follow - up to the European O mb ud s man decision of 2 8 J u ly 1999 in his own -in iti ative in qu ir y rel ated to the cod e
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the dra f ting of the cod e, it has taken on bo ard all the draft recommend ations of the European O mb ud s man
The cod e will be a document exc lu sive ly deal ing with the relations of the Commission' s administration with the public
It will be adopted through a leg ally -b ind ing Commission decision to be p ub lish ed in the O ffic ial J our n al of the European Comm un ities
The document has been dra wn up taking full account of the provision s contain ed in the draft prepared by the European O mb ud s man 's offic e
A cc ord ing to the rel ated provision s in the Trea ties the responsible legisl ator for establishing its R ul es of Pro ced ure is the Commission itself
However, it goes without saying that the Commission ad her es to the principle of reg ular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspect s of administ ra tive reform
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner
However, I would still like to ask when this cod e will fin ally come into force , bear ing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997
The new sp aper report s were mis le ad ing
I do not think there is any differ ence between us and the O mb ud s man
There is a question about the legislative b ase on which we have taken the best adv ice and I think we are s ound ly pla ced on that
I want to repe at that hon oura ble Member s, like the hon oura ble Member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it
It is extremely important and I recogn ise the concern of the hon oura ble Member
I want to thank the Commission for what I per ce ive as a very positive answer
For safety ' s s ake , I should like to have confirm ation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of J ac ob S ö der man ' s proposal which the Commission think s is unacceptable
Is it true that the cont ents of all part s of the proposal will be approved ?
Let me read what it say s in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true !
" I would like to stress again that the Commission has ac cep ted all the O mb ud s man 's recommend ations contain ed in his draft recommend ations of J u ly 1999 "
B oth document s, that is the Commission' s document and the O mb ud s man 's draft , cover large ly the same ground
The only substan ti al question that has ar is en is the legislative basis
I can go into that in detail if the hon oura ble Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all four s with the O mb ud s man on this important issue
We will be happ y to incorpor ate Mr P at ten ' s not es into the b ib li o graph y, as another b ed side bo ok for the Members to bear in mind
As the author is not present , Question No 3 2 l aps es
I ap olog ise to Mr V itor in o for this parliament ary disc ourt es y. I am s or ry

Question No 3 3 by ( H - 0 8 2 9 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : ' M ain st ream ing ' in EU aid policy In 199 5 the Council d re w up guidelines for int e gra ting the equal opportunities di men sion ( ' m ain st ream ing ' ) into the full r ange of EU aid policy
The guidelines call for all sta ff working in the development sector to rece ive continu ous training in ' g ender main st ream ing ' but in recent years only a round 5 0 people have been tra ined and there is still no comp ul s ory training in the subject within the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for De velop ment
' M ain st ream ing ' means taking account of equ ality between women and m en as an integr al part of all for ms of development policy, strategy and measures
To achieve that, the Council 's guidelines must be implemented in their entire ty
C urr ent sta ff must rece ive comp ul s ory training in equal opportunities and 1 - 2 day s ' training in such issues should form an essential part of the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for De velop ment 's introdu ct ory cour s es for new sta ff
Is the Commission prepared to take such measures ?
C an I first of all emphas ise how s or ry my colleag ue , Mr N i els on , was that he could not be here but the hon oura ble Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his m ission is, tr ying to ensure that our agreement with S ou th A f ric a sur v i ves
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introdu ction to g ender and development, part of the so -c all ed ind u ction cour s es for new sta ff , something that has been done already but not, I ad mit , on a reg ular basis
The training of sta ff mo ving to the de leg ations in the different regions is another ent ry point
The training then would be a ut om atic ally perf orm ed without being comp ul s ory
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our official s rece ive in project c y c le management
As far as possible , we want to see this s ort of training a ut om atic ally bu il t into programmes at the out se t , inst ead of having to be t ack led s ep ar ately and l ater
My own view as a form er development min ister is that these issues should be main st ream ed themselves and t ack led at the hear t of training and not turn ed into a s ort of op tion al add - on
The ques t for equ ality should per me ate the work of the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for De velop ment at all level s. It is not to be brought in as a " s ort of op tion al add - on "
This must nat ur ally lead to a reform ul ation of development go als and strateg ies, together with a trans f orm ation of institutions and process es so that both women ' s and m en ' s prior ities and needs are better ref lect ed
In addition , measures must be taken to combat differ ences on the ground s of g ender
E qu ality must per me ate not only projects and programmes but also all over ar ch ing go al s, action plans and strateg ies
It would appe ar that we are in agreement about this
However, responsibility for ens uring that due attention is given to equ ality li es with dep art ment al and un it man ag ers
If the l at ter do not have the required prof ession al compe t ence, then nothing will happen and g ender main st ream ing will no longer be a priority
E xt re mely few members of the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for De velop ment , that is to say un it man ag ers and more sen i or man ag ers, have taken part in the g ender cour s es that have been organ ised
On ly one man ag er has particip ated in g ender tra in ing, and for h alf a day
That is nat ur ally unacceptable
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that un it man ag ers and more sen i or man ag ers go through the necessary g ender training ?
G ender has in fact been included in the comp ul s ory introdu ct ory course for new employ e es, but then with only one to two h our s dev oted to it on each course
This limited training e lement has , however, been rem o ved from all introdu ct ory cour s es which have taken place in recent tim es
As I point out in my question , one to two day s, and not one to two h our s, need to be dev oted to the subject
My question is this : is the Commission really prepared to comp ly with the adopted guidelines for g ender main st ream ing at the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for De velop ment ?
We ll I certainly take g ender main st ream ing serious ly and so does my colleag ue Commissioner N i els on
I must not go on about bo ok s, but I have just been read ing the bo ok by D a vid L and is B arn h ill on what makes some countries pro sp erous and some countries less pro sp erous and it is inter es ting to see there the importance that he att ach es to g ender issues , in the economic pro s per ity and political st ability of soci e ti es, going back m ill en n ia
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be comp ul s ory - after all there is no comp ul s ory training on any thing in the Commission - it should be essential
And , since it should be essential , I would hope that every b od y would make certain that they had ad equ ate g ender training
That goes for every b od y at wh ate ver level of sen i ority
It is not something which more sen i or official s can de em appropriate for their j un i ors but think that they are too g ro wn - up or too sen i or to rece ive themselves
Th ird ly, one of the best approach es to this issue is to integr ate g ender as an important and cross -c ut ting issue into the most po p ular cour s es for development official s and above all perhaps for the project c y c le management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground
So I sy mp ath ise very much with what the hon oura ble Member has said
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstr ates practical ity and the imp er ative of gi ving this the attention which it des er ves
S ince 199 1 , the Community has provided significant financial support to the N e w Ind epend ent States including the countries of central A si a
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the T A C I S programme
In 1998 and 1999 K y r g y z stan , K a z ak h stan , U z b e k ist an and Tur k men ist an received technical assistance of EUR 7 5 million
This assistance has deli ver ed benefit s in all sector s, in particular agric ulture , inf ra st ruct ure development, the priv ate economy and the strengthen ing of institutions
Sec urity consider ations have prevent ed T aj i k ist an from bene f iting fully from T A C I S but a re h ab il it ation programme of EUR 7 . 2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999
In addition to national programm es, the European Union has support ed important regional actions in the energ y, transport and environmental sect ors
F o od security programmes in central A si a be gan in 199 6 , following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind
These programmes have bene f ited K y r g y z stan and to a more limited ext ent, T aj i k ist an
Fund ing for N G O programmes in T aj i k ist an amount ed to EUR 7 . 4 2 million in 1998 and 1999
O ver the same period , K y r g y z stan received EUR 1 7 million
S ince 199 3 the Commission' s European Community H uman it ar ian O ffic e, E C H O , has been active in supp or ting the most v ul ner able groups and sect ors in T aj i k ist an and K y r g y z stan
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3 . 8 million was grant ed to K y r g y z stan and T aj i k ist an received over EUR 3 5 million , main ly for food , m ed ical supp li es, water and s an it ation
F re qu ent monitoring and situation assess ments have sh own that European Union assistance is contrib u ting to the st ability of these countries and therefore the on go ing peace process
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of C entral A si a and the C as p ian S e a bec om ing the B alk ans of the 2 1 st C ent ur y
That is why it is imp er ative to st ab il ise the two major states of Tur k men ist an and U z b e k ist an in particular
That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sp h ere of compe t ence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are go ing, that is, with regard to political relations that is
Of course, that fall s within your re mit ; my next question fall s within Mr N i els on ' s re mit in that it concerns environmental cooper ation, in particular matters p ertain ing to water and the problems sur round ing the c ot t on mon oc ulture s, which are the cause of great a ri d ity
We were able , at the I stan b ul S um mit a c ou p le of wee ks ag o, to meet and have discussion s with some of the C entral A si an rep ublic s
I am very an x ious that we should strengthen our relations hip with them
I can s end the hon oura ble Member , if he would like , a detail ed b re ak d own of exact ly where we stand on the negoti ation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the C entral A si an rep ublic s
Ob vious ly everyone will hope that his pre dic tion of what may happen in the future is on the glo om y s ide
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of C entral A si a
I have he ard the hon oura ble Member talk in the past about the C au c as us as well
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which t al ks about conf lic t pre vention should be look ing at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the s ort of conf lic t in the future which has caus ed so much dev ast ation in the B alk ans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to sp end other wise , had we taken more pre - emp tive measures if those had been possible
So the hon oura ble Member 's rem ark s about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made
We are contrib u ting to programmes in the region which have some ec ological imp act
Our food programmes are direct ly rel ated to structural reform s in agric ulture as well as po ver ty al le v i ation
Th ose programmes themselves are intend ed to ensure that agric ulture has a more s ound ly based position in those soci e ties and does not cons ist simply of r ap ing the l and
There is an ec ological aspect which we should continue to give priority to
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has app la ud ed the Commissioner ' s answer
This is not the us ual state of affair s
And further more the Commissioner has not qu oted from his b ib li o graph y this time
Thank you very much , Mr P at ten , for your inter ven tions today
Question No 3 5 by ( H - 0 7 7 8 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : G ree k action plan for employment A cc ord ing to the find ings of the e val u ation of A ction P l ans for E mployment , G ree ce and It aly are the main t ar get s for critic ism from the Commission for not proper ly carry ing out employment support measures and policies
The report states that in G ree ce and It aly t ar get s for impro ving ? e mploy ability ? have not yet been reached and it is doubt ful whether the policies to be implemented will en able the guidelines on pre ven ting and deal ing with long -term unemployment to be comp li ed with
The report also comments that in G ree ce there are no plans for medium to long -term measures aim ed at redu cing employment tax and ins ur ance ch ar g es, or for the satis fact ory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment polic ies, and, in addition , that there are no exact employment f ig ures
C ould the Commission say whether the G ree k Government has made any specific commit ments on how to t ack le the problems of you th and long -term unemployment , and what these commit ments are ? H as the government legisl ated for and put into place a su it able system for p in p o in ting , rec ord ing and monitoring f lu ct u ations in unemployment , or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to c oun ting those out of work ?
As far as Mr P ap ay ann ak is ' question is concerned, in the 1999 A ction P l an for E mployment , the Commission proposed certain recommend ations for G ree ce with a view to impro ving the efficiency of the A ction P l an for E mployment
The most important recommend ations rel ated to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector servic es, where problems exist , improve the sta tis tical monitoring system and apply pre ven tive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the A ction P l an for E mployment
The G ree k Government introdu ced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : " Y es to W or k " and " B ack to W or k "
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the qu an tit ative objectives were achie ved
The G ree k Government ac know led g es the problem of its being un able to rec ord human resources enter ing and le a ving work and is therefore comm itt ed, first ly, to rest ruct uring public sector employment services in G ree ce , second ly, to set ting up effic ient employment prom o tion cent res - this programme has already st ar ted but has not yet been comple ted - and, third ly, to introdu cing a system of elect ron ic employment card s and using su it able I T system s to monitor all these policies
In the new programme sub mitted for the period from 2000 to 200 6 , which is being finan ced from the Social Fund , both the resources and the policies should be us ed, with the Commission' s support , to implement the objectives which I refer red to ear li er
The Commission will keep a close w at ch on the G ree k Government in order to ensure that it hon our s the commit ments which it has made
Thank you, Commissioner for your rep ly
However, our current situation is as follow s : at 1 1 . 3 % , we have the second high est unemployment in Europe, which was not previous ly the case, we have the b ig g est increase in unemployment , we sp end less than any one else on the une mploy ed, i.e. less than 1 % of G D P , while other countries, such as Fr ance, B el g ium and German y sp end 3 - 4 % , and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been us ed, inter a li a, to combat unemployment
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommend ations
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommend ations will be ad her ed to
However, my question for a very long time has been this : what happen ed with previous policies ?
D id any one find work ?
How many people found work ?
If you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before
What has been done about training ?
Is the purp ose of the fam ous training cent res to provide jobs for inst ruct ors or tra ine es ?
Do we have any f ig ures ?
In other words, do we have way s of chec k ing what is happen ing with this government policy in G ree ce ?
Mr P ap ay ann ak is , the only answer I can give you is that the G ree k Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introdu ce comp ut er ised sta tis tical rec ord s and to set up struct ures so that the programmes implemented have the qu an tit ative results which you mention ed, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for form ul ating policies
G ree ce has seen an increase in the employment r ate and, as far as I can see , an increase in produ c tiv ity
The action which the Commission can take rel ates to the specific guidelines
As you know , there are 2 2 guidelines on which each country is e val u ated
They concern access to tra in ing, the ra ti o of m en to women with access to tra in ing, and special action for the long -term une mploy ed
The Commission will end e a vour , for all these specific guidel in es, to qu an tif y the d at a and to ob tain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 200 6
Question No 3 6 by ( H - 0 7 8 2 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : D anish ear ly re tire ment p ension sch e me W ill the Commission state whether the D anish ear ly re tire ment p ension sch e me has been approved in its entire ty and whether there are dis ag ree ments between D en mark and the Commission in other areas of social policy ?
The D anish p ension sch e me , the E fter l ø n , only allow s people res id ent in D en mark and people who have comple ted the required period of employment in D en mark to re tire
S ome work ers have comp l ain ed to the European Commission because they do not have the right to re tire
The D anish authorities do not consider that they are oblig ed under Community law to pay this comp ens ation to work ers taking ear ly re tire ment who do not meet the conditions required under D anish law
It should be not ed that the current regulation on social security system s does not at present refer to the question of ear ly re tire ment and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are , however, still p ending before the Council
There is, as yet , no European Court case law on E fter l ø n , but it could val id ly be argu ed that the res id ence require ment is inc om p a ti ble with general cla us es now in force ban ning discri mination on the ground s of national ity
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meeting s and discussion s with the D anish Government with a view to find ing a common l ang u age and a common approach
The last meeting on the subject was held in No ve mber 1999 and we are w a iting for the Commission services ' final proposals on whether or not inf ring e ment proceed ings will be ins tit ut ed against D en mark
I no tic ed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the D anish ear ly re tire ment p ension sch e me as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was ind ire ct ly app ar ent that the answer was that it has not been
I should like to ask the Commissioner express ly to confirm that the sch e me has not been approved by the Commission
The Commissioner also more than h int ed, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bring ing the whole issue of the D anish ear ly re tire ment p ension sch e me before the Court of Justice in L u x em bour g , specifically on the ground s that the sch e me actually discri min ates against non- D anish w age ear n ers who are un able to fulf il the condition s, due to the fact that they have not been in pa id work for the period required under the D anish system
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any appro x im ate de ad l ines in connection with this matter , for it is a problem which needs cl ar ific ation in the context of the D anish soci o - p o li tical debate
So I should be gr ate ful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question
H on oura ble Member , I should just like to stress that both D en mark and num erous other Member States are having problems inter p re ting the dire ctives and transp os ing them into national law
This is one such case and discussion s are under way between the D anish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter , to the benefit of the work ers who meet the requirements and who , as things stand , have a right to this p ension
B ri ef ly, just to follow on from that last point , I inv ite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission' s objec tion s, such as they are , would not in any way inf ring e the rights of D anish national s to benefit from this sch e me , but simply that the Commission has a concern , which it has the right to have under Community law , to ensure that the sch e me appli es to all EU citizens who qu al if y
I think that the answer is brief and clear
Of course it is as you say
There will be no problem with D anish national s within D en mark , that is not where the problem li es
The problem is with D anish national s or other national s res id ing outside D en mark
Question No 3 7 by ( H - 0 7 9 1 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : W or k ing time directive C an the Commission say what action it propos es taking to ensure a level of protection , equ i val ent to that provided by the 199 3 working time directive , for non- con s ult ant h os p ital do ct or s, who were exc lud ed from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amend ing directive ( CO M ( 9 8 ) 0 6 6 2 - C 4 - 0 7 1 5 / 9 8 - 9 8 / 0 3 1 8 ( S Y N ) ) ?
A proposal has been dra f ted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non- con s ult ant h os p ital do ct ors
The cont ent of the proposal concerns the a ver age 4 8 - h our working week of do ct or s, with the possibility , following negoti ation, of increasing it to 5 4 h our s
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all ag reed on the cont ent but there is dis ag ree ment on the tr an sition al period for implementing the directive
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 1 3
This proposal is still being discuss ed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the cod ec ision procedure
Al though there is this dis ag ree ment , I should stress that all three institutions agree on the cont ent and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sen si tive question which concerns an excep tion ally large number of working do ct ors throughout Europe
Question No 3 8 by ( H - 0 8 0 5 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : M e as ures to adv ance g ender equ ality One of the working groups of Commission ers ann oun ced by President Prodi has as its objective the prom o tion of measures to adv ance g ender equ ality ( g ender main st ream ing )
Wh ich Commission ers are members of this group ?
How many meeting s of the group have been held to d ate ?
What conc re te measures have been discuss ed ?
This question co vers several individual matters
It ref ers to the special Commission working group deal ing with questions of equ ality
The Commission ers taking part are President Prodi, V ice - P resid ent K in n ock , Mr R ed ing and myself
The meeting s of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 1 1 J an u ary 2000
Th ree serious issues were discuss ed : the first was the first discussion on the f if th programme for women , of which I g ave an initi al e val u ation, the second issue was the report by Mr B us qu in on the inves tig ation into the participation of women in research and sci ence, and the third involved Mr K in n ock , who report ed to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the g ender equ ality di men sion in the over all reform s currently taking place in the Community
Thank you very much , Commissioner, for your rep ly, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet , since this matter is of the gre ates t importance . We tr ust ed this Commission, from the out se t , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equ ality for m en and women
I hope that, in the future , things will change and meeting s will become f re qu ent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to spe ed up and conclud e, as quickly as possible , those measures which will promote greater equ ality between m en and women
Mrs A v il é s - P ere a, that was an ex h ort ation rather than a question
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer do ct r ine or good int en tions
A llow me to say just one word . I agree that the working group should have m et ear li er but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken st ra ight away
Question No 3 9 by ( H - 0 8 0 7 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : Community EQUAL initiative On 1 3 O ct o ber 1999 , the Commission adopted the Community 's EQUAL initiative , the aim of which is trans n ational cooperation to find and develop new means of comb ating discri mination and in equ al ities in the l ab our market with the focus on asylum - se e k ers
U nder this u mb re ll a, each Member State is to sub mit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country
What criteria will the Commission use to appro ve or reject the Member States ' programmes ?
Wh ich Community bod y will control the funding of the st e er ing group and the monitoring committee and ver if y that the programme is carried out exact ly and correct ly ?
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000 - 2 00 6 will total 2 4 8 7 b illion e uro . As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding v ent ure with the Member States, what will G ree ce 's contribution amount to ?
The EQUAL initiative is not restric ted to certain groups of people
It s purp ose is to combat discri mination in the work p la ce
The decision on this initiative was taken in B er lin , where it was decid ed to take account of prof ession al groups of asylum seek ers and to include them in its action
This is an important aspect of this initiative
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comp ly with the regulation
This is the same as the Social Fund regul ation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation
It has been sub mitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satis f ies national requirements and national plans def ined in accordance with ag reed European strategy
The Member States, i.e. the national government s, have pri m ary responsibility for set ting up the joint ag en ci es, sub mit ting proposal s, se le c ting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carry ing out pri m ary control
With in the European Commission, the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for E mployment is responsible for implement ation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for Fin an cial Con t rol , the An ti - F ra ud O ffice and the European Court of A ud it ors
The last question concerns the amount grant ed
G ree ce has been grant ed E C U 9 8 million
The contribution commitment is 8 0% , ris ing to an 8 5 % contribution from the initiative for the is land regions, especially the rem ote G ree k is land s, and a contribution by G ree ce of 15 %
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative , especially the four actions des c rib ed in it, will result both in comp lic ated bureauc ra cy and, par ad o x ic ally, a non- t rans p ar ent structure
For example, one w ond ers how a development partnership will pro ve its cooper ative spirit or its represent ative cap ac ity , as required by action 2 in paragraph 3 3 of the guidelines
At the same time, the oblig ation to en g age in trans n ational cooper ation, the comp lic ated demand s of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership in e v it ably require large structure s, as these are the only struct ures which can meet such demand s
However, this contra dic ts the st ated aim of the general objectives for dec entral ised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas
However, at the same time, participation by those actually discri min ated against , such as asylum seek ers, immig r ants and so on , is r ender ed imp os sible or mere ly sy mb olic
Finally, if you consider the over all amount , which is on the small s ide , - EUR 2 . 8 b illion for 15 Member States - and how amb iti ous the objectives are , I am a f ra id that all we shall suc ceed in doing is to pro ve that unemployment is a b ad thing
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being process ed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to redu ce unemployment , it cannot pos sib ly deal with the issue of redu cing unemployment , or to support an increase in employment
That is the job of the European St r ateg y for E mployment and the Social Fund , which have h uge su ms of money and excep tion ally large resources at their disp os al , especially for countries like G ree ce
The EQUAL initiative has a specific m ission
To encoura ge , to assist prom o tion , to create sta tis tic s, to create stud ies and ag en ci es to support those sec tions of the population which su ffer discri mination
So what we are look ing for is cooperation between local group s, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experi ences ; that is main ly what we are look ing for , and for experience to be trans fer red from one country to another so that it can be em ul ated
This is the ph il os oph y behind the initiative ; the budget is comm ens ur ate with it and our aim is for development ag en ci es, non- governmental organ is ations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible , so that it can get as close to the people as possible
Question No 4 0 by ( H - 0 8 0 8 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : Article 1 3 T E U and E mployment The draft Commission Dire ctive establishing a general framework for equal treat ment in employment and o c cu p ation gi ves ex emp tion to re lig ious organ is ations (A r t . 4 . 2 )
C ould the Commission ple ase tell Parliament the circ um stan ces and the groups within Article 1 3 ( T E U ) like ly to be effect ed by such an ex emp tion ?
A month ag o, the Commission sub mitted a proposal on equal treat ment in employment , as pres c rib ed in the Treat y, in order to implement Article 1 3
The ban on discri mination is the r ule in the p ack age of dire ctives and programmes which we sub mitted
At the Commission' s proposal and after appro x im ately two years of consult ation with social ag en ci es, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of excep tions have been made
These excep tions rel ate to prof ession s which must be ex erc ised by person s with a g en u ine prof ession al qu al ific ation
A llow me to give you a specific example to i ll ust r ate this
In a re lig ious sch o ol , it is l og ical for an ex emp tion to be reques ted and ac cep ted in order to ensure that the te ach er is of the fa ith to which the re lig ious sch o ol in question be l ong s
That is the s ort of ex emp tion we are talking about
C lear ly this is not a general ex emp tion and the different approach which allow Member States to introdu ce special provision s are only jus tif ied in the case of this special prof ession al qu al ific ation
This is a per ver se inter p ret ation of end ing discri mination
For inst ance, re lig ious sch o ol s could quite proper ly say to a R om an C ath olic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a g ay man or because you are a l es b ian
H ere we have from the Commission a re in for ce ment of a h i er ar ch y of opp ression
S ure ly what we should be do ing, and I hope you will agree , Commissioner, is en g ag ing the person to do the job on the basis of their cap ability , and we should not ens h r ine such b ig ot ry and pre j ud ice , no matter how s in c ere ly held
I must stress that this ex emp tion is not a ref us al of work for any reason , be it the reason which you mention ed, se x ual o ri ent ation, e th n ic discri mination or any other reason
It allow s a ch o ice to be made only where special qu al ific ations are needed which rel ate direct ly to the activ ity in question
In other words, it is positive discri mination
In the example which you mention ed, it is only l og ical that the te ach er in a C ath olic sch o ol should be C ath olic
That is the only form of ex emp tion which is accept able
Question No 4 1 by ( H - 0 8 1 3 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : P rom oting jobs for women in sever e ly less -f av ou red regions G i ven the en orm ous difficulties in ob tain ing work which women face in certain sever e ly less -f av ou red regions, and given that these women very se ld om have any resources to draw on , in terms of either fin ance, ent re pr ene ur ial or cooper ative tra ditions or even training fa cili ti es, living as they do in rural dist ric ts where 8 0% of the population is on the po ver ty line , what measures or actions are plan n ed to help these women over come the h ur d le of their social environment ?
Do es the Commission intend to put forward low est common d en om in ator policies which will proper ly ref lect the ad mitted ly extre me but non eth el ess real - life situation of these women , or will their p light once again be over lo ok ed by the new employment policies ?
Ob vious ly, the cohesion policy ex ists for less -f av ou red regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Fund s, the Social Fund and the Ag ric ult ural Fund exist for the cohesion policy
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget
The aim of these regional polic ies, which, of course, are implemented under the joint ly ag reed European guidelines in each Member State , i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both m en and women
I should point out that 7 0% of funding for the period 2000 - 2 00 6 , i.e. EUR 1 9 5 b illion , will go to the less -f av ou red regions of Europe
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are creat ed, I would like to say, first , that there is, v ia the Social Fund , an entire equal opportunities p ill ar which the Member States must implement , i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being stud ied gi ves special priority to development strateg ies which aim to give special support to women in small enter p ris es in the agric ult ural sector and in rural to ur ism, with a view to increasing the involve ment of women in agric ult ural regions
Commissioner, thank you for gi ving me a well - int ention ed answer , which has been r ig or ous and well - ar gu ed
However, I can ass ure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have refer red to - reach these sever e ly less -f av ou red regions
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal fo oting with those areas where we work in cooper ation, where al most n one ex ists
Therefore , my question is whether you could exam ine the possibility that some of the policies on m ic ro c red it s, which have brought results in cooper ation, could be appli ed to those women in sever e ly less -f av ou red regions, who have the o d d s st ack ed against them
I am very fam ili ar with the programmes which you refer to
I can ass ure you that we are not reach ing the areas where there is most need
With these fore c ast s of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the fore c ast s of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote , as we should , employment among st women in the sever e ly less -f av ou red regions
I would therefore ask you to stud y the possibility of apply ing m ic ro c red it policies
The Commissioner accept s and takes good note of Mrs I z qu i er d o R o j o ' s inter vention
Question No 4 2 by ( H - 0 8 1 7 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : Commission' s plans for present ation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, set ting out a specific plan with a tim et able for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the ' so cial dialogue '
C an the Commission say what its precise int en tions are regarding the present ation of a new social action programme ?
We es tim ate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be read y at the end of this su m m er
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consult ations with Parliament, the social partners and non- governmental organ is ations
These discussion s have already start ed, but we will need to take account of the results in L is b on
The L is b on European Council is tr ying to take a new approach to the question of social exc lusion and the link between social exc lusion and the information soci et y, economic policy and reform s
These results will be most important in sh ap ing the Commission' s social programme
I have already to ld the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in A pri l between Parliament and the Commission, after the L is b on con ference , so that all aspect s can be discuss ed and the social programme for 2000 - 2 00 6 can fin ally be dra f ted
C lear ly, any future social action programme should take account of development s, for example within information techn olog y, and, in time, become a modern social action programme
But can you also provide confirm ation concerning the matter I ra ise in my question , namely that the programme will be design ed in such a way that we shall ob tain a conc re te tim et able for the various ty p es of legislation in the social sp h ere which the Commission is planning , as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two s id es of industry ?
We need to see which conc re te al tern atives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purp ose of reach ing agreements
Firstly, I agree with you entire ly. A cc ount will be taken of the information soci ety ; that was something which I too mentioned
Social exc lusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , every thing needs to be look ed at now in the light of the new reality of the information soci ety
Secondly, there will obvious ly be tim et abl es for the initiatives within which system atic monitoring will also have to be implemented
Wh ere I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know , is not included in the ar tic les of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty
S ince the author is not present , Question No 4 3 l aps es
Question No 4 4 by ( H - 0 8 1 9 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : O pport un ities of the dis abled to take adv ant age of freedom of movement within the EU U nder Article 1 3 of the Amsterdam Treat y, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take adv ant age of freedom of movement within the Union
However, for people with various kind s of ph y s ical dis ability who are in need of special transport and person al assist ance, freedom of movement is still high ly restric ted
What measures is the Commission taking to fa cil it ate opportunities for the dis abled in this area ?
On 2 6 No ve mber 1999 , the European Commission approved a p ack age of measures to combat discri mination
As far as the p ack age in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentr ates on comb ating discri min ation, especially in the work p la ce
The European Commission belie ves that this initiative to combat discri mination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these person s
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport , services and all ty p es of inst all ation if they are to ex erc ise their right to freedom of movement
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special ar r ange ments in bus es, co ach es and other vehic l es, so that people with special needs with mo bility problems and people using wh eel ch air s have access to them
In addition , you should know that, on 4 J un e 1998 , the Council approved the recommend ation for a p an - E uro pe an type of par k ing per mit to be introdu ced for people with special need s, the aim of which is to help them tra vel in all Member States with a common per mit so that they can take adv ant age of all organ ised par k ing areas throughout Europe
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the dis abled have to take adv ant age of freedom of movement in Europe
It is quite an exp ensive business if you are to tra vel from G oth en b ur g to some wh ere else in Europe on ho li day or on a stud y vis it if you are in a wh eel ch air and also need to have a person al assist ant or car er with you in order to manage
I am gr ate ful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan
It is of course a pr ere qu is ite , however, that there be financial resources and means of actually cross ing the b ord ers ph y s ic ally if you have a dis ability
It would be inter es ting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set a side financial resources for those who have dis ab ili ti es, so that they too might v ent ure further out into the world than mere ly to where their wh eel ch air s take them
I refer red to the directive which the Commission has proposed on comp ul s ory ar r ange ments for means of public transport , so that people with special needs can use them
It has not yet been pass ed by the Council ; it is at the consult ation stage
I think that a strategic decision of this s ort can be taken at European level
I think it is excep tion ally difficult for us to special ise in aid programmes for person al transport
That is deal t with either under special programmes in e du c ation, for y oun g people , for women and for exch ang es or must be a matter for national policy
Question No 4 5 by ( H - 000 6 / 00 ) :
S ub ject : C om p li ance with Dire ctive 9 6 / 7 1 / E C concerning the pos ting of work ers The pos ting of work ers directive has still not been implemented in D en mark , even though the de ad line has pass ed
The draft legislation before the F ol ke ting does not contain any rules govern ing rights of employ ed person s under colle ctive agreements
P urs u ant to Article 3 ( 8 ) of the Dire ctive , terms and conditions of employment must be in keep ing with the ' c ol le ctive agreements which have been conclud ed by the most represent ative employ ers ' and l ab our organ is ations at national level and which are appli ed throughout national ter rit ory '
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imp osed on the two s id es of industry without a legal basis
There are therefore two possible solution s : either the Dire ctive is in app lic able in D en mark , or D en mark is required by the Dire ctive to introdu ce un i vers ally applic able agreements
C an the Commission confirm that the Dire ctive concerning the pos ting of work ers is in app lic able in D en mark as far as ' c ol le ctive agreements . . . dec la red un i vers ally applic able ' ( c f . Article 3 ( 1 ) ) are concerned, given that such un i vers ally applic able agreements do not exist under D anish law ?
If not, will it explain how the Dire ctive is to be comp li ed with in this area ?
The European Union pos ting of work ers directive sti pul ates that the comp ul s ory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applic able in the ho st country must also apply to work ers post ed to that country
What it say s it that one of two things may app ly, i.e. either the legislation in the ho st country or the colle ctive agreements which have been dec la red to be the rules un i vers ally applic able to a specific sector
B ec ause D en mark does not have a system for dec l ar ing colle ctive agreements to be un i vers ally applic able rul es, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, ap art from current conditions of employment sti pul ated in legisl ation, the h our s in un i vers ally applic able colle ctive agreement s, conclud ed by the most represent ative organ isation s, also apply to post ed work ers
In other words, to put it simp ly, D en mark has a ch o ice : it can either introdu ce legislation or it can use the legislative process to ch o ose a colle ctive agreement and leg ally activ ate it
D is c us sion s are being held between the European Commission and D en mark , and D en mark is expect ed to no tif y the Commission of the transp o sition of this directive into its national legislation
The de ad line by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions exp ire d on 6 De ce mber 1999 and we have not received a rep ly
We are w a iting to see what the next move will be
Thank you for a very clear answer , the g ist of which - if the inter p ret ation is correct - is that the pos ting of work ers directive ent ail s an oblig ation on the part of the D anish state to establish a system of un i vers ally applic able agreements
It is a very clear answer , but it is also an answer , may I point out , which put s D anish organ isation s, the D anish Government and the D anish Parliament in a very , very difficult situation politic ally, for it is a well - know n fact that there are a number of basic problems as soci ated with the relations hip between the D anish mod el , which is based quite obvious ly upon colle ctive agreement s, and the Con tin ent al mod el , which pres u pp os es legislation
The dis ag ree ment and the cor res pon d ence to which you refer , Commissioner, concern , first and fore most , another directive , namely the working time directive , but now we can fore se e another let ter of form al no tice and further Treaty inf ring e ment proceed ings lo om ing because the D anish Government does not intend , or has express ly st ated that it does not wish , to implement legislation and establish un i vers ally applic able agreements
Firstly, no attemp t is being made to change the system in D en mark or in any other country
As I said ear li er, there are always problems inter p re ting the dire ctives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because system s are very different from one country to another
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to D en mark
It is not only D en mark which has matters p ending
F ive countries have transp osed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage
What now needs to be done , and this was the reason for the consult ations and discussion s between the Commission and the D anish Government , and with other government s, is to find the best way forward , so that something which is decid ed at European level by all the Member States, and which constit utes a general framework , can also include work ers post ed to D en mark from other countries
And this is the dire ction in which we expect the D anish and the other n ine governments to move
Thank you very much , Commissioner, for your d ed ic ation
You have fulf ill ed your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions
We congratulate you
S ince the time alloc ated to Ques tions to the Commission has e la p s ed, Ques tions 4 6 to 6 8 will be rep li ed to in w ri ting
That conclud es Question T ime

1997 discharge
The next item is the report (A5- 000 4 /2 000 ) by Mrs van d er L a an , on behalf of the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol , on gi ving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Comm un ities for the 1997 financial year ( S ection I - Parliament, II - Council, II I - Commission, I V - Court of Justice and V - Court of A ud it ors ) [ S E C ( 199 8 ) 5 2 0 - C 4 - 0 3 5 0 / 199 8 , S E C ( 199 8 ) 5 2 2 - C 4 - 0 3 5 1 / 199 8 , S E C ( 199 8 ) 5 1 9 - C 4 - 0 3 5 2 /1999 ]
The Commissioner, Mrs Sch re y er, is not here yet , but I hope , and expect , that she will ar ri ve in the next few min utes
N ever thel ess, I recommend that we start , in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate , and particularly the rapporteur ' s speech , from her offic e, if that is where she still is
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Sch re y er must have a very good reason for not being here because her abs ence would be in e x c us able other wise
I would like to start by thank ing my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation
Mr President, ear ly last year , the 1997 discharge was post pon ed because this Parliament could not pos sib ly grant discharge to a res ign ing Commission which could not enter into any commit ments for the future
In its resolution , this Parliament st ated that discharge could not be grant ed until we had received seri ou s, far - re ach ing proposals for reform from the new European Commission
This report, therefore, appe ar s at a crucial time, on the e ve of Mr K in n ock ' s reform s
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introdu ce far - re ach ing reform s to these plans
In the period lead ing up to this, it already appe ared , on the basis of the initi al draft s, that the Commission had made very important pl ed g es
We asked for a wh ist le -b low er ' s regul ation, and this is now in place
Parliament want ed financial ins pe ction and a ud it f un ctions to be s ep ar ated
This has now been done
Parliament requ i res a cod e of con du ct for Commission ers and C ab in et s
This is in place too
Parliament asked the Commission to w a ive its ex ces sive priv ile g es
It did this as well
The Commission has also enter ed into commit ments to cooper ate with Parliament in terms of S E M 2000
Fund amental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offic es
These are s ound , first step s which i ll ust r ate that, if this Parliament so wish es, changes are not only possible but can also be trans l ated into action quickly
We want more than that, how ever
The Commission should now produ ce an amb iti ous and far - re ach ing reform programme
This is not only necessary for proper public administ r ation, it is a con d iti o s ine qu a non of reg ain ing the tr ust of the European citizen
We now demand from the European Commission clear pl ed g es concerning the following points
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission docu ments
This , however, pres u pp os es that we set up an internal sch e me quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confid enti ality of sen si tive docu ments
In the context of provid ing inform ation, I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to docu ments
If the current draft is correct , then this is a h uge step back wards in comp ar is on to today
We must put an end to the situation in which finan cially power ful organ is ations with represent ation in Brus sels are able to access information wh il st the or d in ary citizen is not
N e ither can we to ler ate a situation in which a public bod y hold s the c op y ri ght to public docu ments
We would also like a clear job des c ri p tion for each European official so that an official with cons ci enti ous objec tions can more e a si ly ob ject to tas ks which are un eth ical or un la w ful
F urther more, it should be the case that, if the Court of A ud it ors det ect s a m ist ake not just one year but two years run ning , the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on ch an ces of prom o tion
U l tim ately, we also need to achieve better cooper ation, of course, between the European Court of A ud it ors and its national c oun ter p art s
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initi al out line of the ex tern al aid policy reform s on 3 1 Mar ch of this year
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power , we have no political inf lu ence because , when the ch ip s are down , we cannot offer effective aid to areas which des per ately need it. I would qu ote G a z a as an example
It is unacceptable that the Commission comple ted the con struction of a h os p ital in 199 6 and that, as yet , it has been left un us ed
Mr President, since 199 6 , the discharge has ac qu ire d a he av y, political signific ance
It is one of the most power ful we ap ons Parliament has and must therefore be dep loy ed with care
This is why we will most prob ably grant the discharge tomorrow
However, we are not s urr ender ing this we ap on without pla cing a time b om b in its place
Inde ed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial ir reg ular ities high light ed by the Court of A ud it ors have been c le ared up
Finally, this discharge report is nat ur ally address ed to the Commission
But this does not det ra ct from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own h ouse in order
As long as we have no stat u s, we are not cre di ble as a force for reform ing the Union
The reform s of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe ' s development process
We cannot have a dec is ive and fa ir Europe un less it is also open and democratic
All institutions must now j o in for ces in order to work together towards build ing this type of Europe
Mr President, the Committee on Ind ustry decid ed to go a he ad and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so
We w ent a he ad because we f el t we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that is, by making sure that we take good care of tax p ay ers ' money in Europe
D uring the course of our work on this report it bec a me clear that there are pers ist ent problems in the sp ending areas under the control of our budget
They were not un i q ue to 1997 and two strand s seem to run through them. The first is a t end ency for the Commission to em b ark on very amb iti ous programm es, particularly in third countries, without su fficient assess ment of the practical ities of implementation and proper resour cing
The second invol ves serious man ag eri al short com ings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordin ation ac ross dep art ments and management of ex tern al contra ct s
I know that all the In s titution s bear some responsibility for the increasing work lo ad of the Commission and for some of the lack of resour ces. That cannot ex cu se every thing that we ca me ac ross
C itiz ens of Europe expect the European institutions to be proper ly man aged and they are right to do so
That is why I want to e ch o the comments from my colleag ue about the importance of the reform process which has been prom ised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr K in n ock
F rom what I have seen of the reform proces s, it look s good
I sa w some of Mr K in n ock 's p ap ers today, I he ard some of what he had to say
I have every confidence that if we and the poli ti ci ans of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need
But we need that reform process
M an y of the general points raised in our committee 's report have been cover ed in Mrs van d er L a an 's report
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it
It seems to h it on all the right points without just being like some of the old report s, a seri es of detail s
It groups them together and that is very important
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to
One is nuclear safety in East ern Europe
We have to get this right
The Committee of Ind epend ent E x per ts said the Commission was not man ag ing this proper ly
We have to rem ed y that
The second point is about sc ru tin y m ech an is ms
We need from the Commission materi al we can use to help us sc ru tin ise sp ending
We need proper inform ation, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more serious ly than in the past . It has been seen as a bureauc ra tic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible
I hope colleagues in this House will support the ground s for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will p us h a he ad with the reform process which is long over d ue
On ly in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence rest ore d
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are hon est , we find ourselves in a some wh at un us ual situation
We are discuss ing last year ' s discharge , but also the Commission' s responsibility
I would like to ra ise the problems which are still p il ed up high on our des ks
The assess ment of whether or not the discharge will be grant ed also dep end s to some extent on where the emphas is is pla ced
It is about a Commission which is no more
There is now a new Commission
Th en it is l og ical to grant discharge , because how can the current Commissioner be b la m ed where 1997 is concerned ?
The problems remain and this gi ves r ise to doub ts
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intention s, but there is still no structural out line for these good int en tions
Mr K in n ock will present his proposal next month
We are all very much anti cip ating this, but the fact s are still mis s ing at this time when we already have to dec ide whether or not to grant discharge
It is clearly a di le m m a with which the rapporteur has also st ru gg led
This di le m m a st ret ch es be y ond the areas which I have already list ed. T ake , for example, the pl ed g es made by the Commission
They look good in themselves . I have read a few docu ments wr itt en by Mr K in n ock and we have every confidence in them
But I will give two examp les from which it is not as e vid ent that the good int en tions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good out come : the public nature and confid enti ality of docu ments
The previous speak er already said something about this
A document is cir cul ating at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the Commission - which, inst ead of en h an cing the public nature of document s, is having the opp os ite effect
This is an i ll ust ration of emp ty pl ed g es not necess arily lead ing to good result s. This also appli es to wh ist le -b low ers
Mr K in n ock has also dev oted some fin e -s ound ing ph r as es to this subject but, at the same time, it is entire ly un c lear , at this moment when we have to make a decision , what , for example, happ ens with wh ist le -b low ers who want to get something off their ch est and cannot do this intern ally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type
So there is doubt as to whether these pl ed g es of the Commission contain enough sub st ance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made
This also appli es, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Ind ustry has introdu ced
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr K in n ock should come with good int en tions and with s ound plans on person n el policy and financial management , but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious short com ings in the past should come with s ound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general , emp ty proposals
At the mom ent, our group still feel s sy mp ath y for , and pa ti ence with , the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large prop or tion of the m ist akes made in the past , but this pa ti ence has a limit
C lear progress must be vis ible
At present , we tr ust that the Commission will produ ce these s ound proposal s, but it is not a fore g one conclusion that it will do so
Finally, Mr President, the 199 6 discharge was the begin ning of the end of the last Commission
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the begin ning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. O ther wise this discharge will not have been of any value
In assess ing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge , the decision must be based upon what actually occ ur red during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997
In our Group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 199 6
In that year , we voted against gr an ting discharge . As a result , we shall vote against gr an ting discharge for 1997 , too
We think that this p ict ure of our s is confirm ed by the exam in ation carried out by the Court of A ud it ors
It is both good and necessary that reform s have been prom ised
So far , the prom ises which have been made are still , however, to be fulf ill ed, especially where transparency is concerned
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demand s for reform s which are presented in the resolution , but against the gr an ting of discharge
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs V an d er L a an ' s very exper t work on this report
The Union for a Europe of N ations Group cannot vote for appro ving the account s for 1997
The report on so -c all ed discharge contain s a compreh ensive and extremely cri tical sur ve y of the account s
We support these cri tical rem ark s, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite abs ur d , against this back g round , to vote in favour of appro ving the account s
It has not been possible for the Court of A ud it ors to issue an a ud itor ' s statement to the effect that the ar r ange ments cover ed by the account s are law ful , and we should regard it as extremely problem atic if we , as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of account s without having any guarantee of the leg ality of the ar r ange ments concerned
The majority have made their appro val of the account s condition al upon the new Commission' s implementing a seri es of reform s, so as to ensure that what we are fam ili ar with from the previous Commission' s period of offic e is not repe ated
Ag ain , I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortun ate conf u sion of the old Commission' s account ability for 1997 and the new Commission' s account ability for the future
We do not think that the new Commission, under any circ um stan ces, could inc ur liability for the past
We think it is wr ong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution
The m ist akes up until 1999 are att rib ut able to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of know ing whether the new Commission can do any better
B y means of this ext ra ordin ary procedure , Parliament is st o pp ing itself from pla cing liability for the ar r ange ments in 1997 s qu are ly where it be l ong s, namely with the previous Commission
It was the 199 6 account s which l ed to the down f all of the previous Commission, and the 1997 account s are just as inc ri min ating
There is no reason wh y, against this back g round , we should agree to grant discharge
As far as the decision to bal ance the account s is concerned, we shall ab st ain from voting , and where , fin ally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall att ach most importance to the many correct instru ctions contain ed in this and vote in favour of it
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was post pon ed because the e r st wh ile Commission, to wh om it was to be grant ed, had st e pp ed down before the app oint ed time and was only continu ing in offic e in a care t ak er cap ac ity
Mrs van d er L a an ' s report - on which she has la v ish ed a great deal of hard work , and for which we are inde b ted to her - propos es that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to rece ive the discharge for its pre d ecess or ' s budget ary management - Mr C am re just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year , 199 6 , was d en ied
That is just the way things are , how ever
In taking over the m and ate, the new Commission has to ass u me responsibility not just for the achieve ments of the past but also for the m ist akes made
S ince , on account of the colle ge system , discharge can only be grant ed to the Commission as a whole or , al tern ative ly, d en ied or post pon ed, it is no longer of any consequ ence that four form er Commission ers who be l ong ed to the previous Commission that has yet to be disch ar g ed, c ro p up again as Members of this bod y
This question o u ght to have been asked when the new Commission was app oint ed
If Parliament v ot es in favour of the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol ' s proposal this week and grant s discharge , then the Commission must not take this to be a b l ank ch e q ue
For it is the third sec tion of Mrs van d er L a an ' s report that is the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution
The comments contain ed within , under e ight he ad ing s, are an integr al part of the discharge , the implementation of which for ms the basis of our decision
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to exam ine , as a matter of urg ency , whether or not it was too quick to best ow pre m at ure p ra ise on the Commission for 1997
We will be in a position to jud ge just as soon as the Commission present s its reform programme
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to chec k whether efficiency , transparency and account ability , and like wise a s in c ere will ing ness to provide inform ation, are being disp lay ed vis - à - v is the discharge authority
Mr President, we all rec all that Parliament decid ed to post p one the discharge for the 1997 financial year p ending commit ments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform
In response to this the Commission has enter ed into various commit ments and has certainly adopted many reform measures
It is fa ir to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his te am are certainly comm itted to implementing the financial control requirements as la id down by this Parliament
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run - up to the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives
E x isting EU t rea ties will be amend ed so as to ensure , for example, that the enlargement process can suc ceed
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analys ed in this debate. But from the pers pe ctive of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reform ed, it must be done in a way that ens ures that small Member States continue to have represent ation on the Commission
Mr President, the Commission is now to ob tain its discharge for 1997 , but in reality it does not des erve it
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability
It is true that implementation of the B udget for 1997 fe ll within the old Commission' s re mit
The new Commission has , on the other hand, undert ak en to carry out a c le an ing up ex erc ise following form er sc and al s, and I must ad mit that I am not imp ress ed at all
The old mind se t which involved s w eep ing things under the car pe t and prot ec ting one ' s f ri end s unfortun ately still ex ists
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let by g on es be by g on es and make a f res h start
I do not, however, think we can make a f res h start if we do not t id y things up proper ly
I am refer ring here especially to the ear li er sc and als invol ving E C H O
I am very ind ign ant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any docu ments hand ed over on this matter
I am the rapporteur for E C H O on the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol , and I shall have a lot of difficult y carry ing out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information
F rom the outside , it look s as if the Commission has something to h ide
My inves tig ations also unfortun ately suggest that this could be the case
The Commission is not put ting all its card s on the t able and is in that way repe ating an ci ent practice on the part of the Commission
It was this practice which l ed to the Commission' s down f all
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament un con dition al right of access to docu ments
O ther wise , we cannot carry out our work
Thank you, Commissioner Sch re y er
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m
R es pon se to Second Report of Committee of Ind epend ent E x per ts
The next item is the report (A5- 000 1 /2 000 ) by Mr van H ult en, on behalf of the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol , on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Ind epend ent E x per ts on reform of the Commission
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent exper ts ch a ire d by Mr M id d el ho e k to inves tig ate al leg ations of fraud , ne p o tis m and cor ru p tion in the European Commission
On 15 Mar ch the committee p ub lish ed its first report conclud ing that : " I t is bec om ing difficult to find any one who has even the s light est sense of responsibility "
With in a few h our s of the present ation of the report President S an ter ann oun ced the res ign ation of his entire te am
The res ign ation mark ed the end of a b it ter st ru gg le between an increasing ly confid ent Parliament and a European Commission m ire d in al leg ations of sc and al
S ince then the Brus sels l and s c a pe has chang ed be y ond recogn ition ; a new , re in v ig or ated Parliament has been elect ed and a new Commission confirm ed in offic e
S pe aking in this House on 2 1 J u ly President - d es ign ate Prodi undert o ok to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Ind epend ent E x per ts on Commission reform , which contain s 9 0 detail ed recommend ations and which we are deb ating today
The new Commission has already taken important step s to move away from the way it used to function
A cod e of con du ct for Commission ers and their priv ate offic es has been adopted
In a sy mb olic but significant g est ure Commission ers have vol un t arily r en oun ced their en tit lement to the tax -f ree pur ch ase of al c o h ol , to b ac c o, p et rol and consum er goods
N e w rules have been dra wn up and implemented govern ing the app oint ment of sen i or official s
The number of dep art ments has been redu ced
The Commission, in my opinion, has sh own a clear and un p re ced ent ed commitment to change and for this they are to be congratul ated
The over all aim of the reform s must be to create a strong , hon est European public administration equ i pp ed to carry out its tas ks in an effective and effic ient man ner ; an administration in which official s are provided with the means to carry out their tas ks and are held fully account able at all level s ; an administration that recogn ises and re wards m er it and encoura g es official s to develop their full potential
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas
First , financial management and control within the Commission must be impro ved
One of the main problems is the lack of a function ing system of financial control
The Commission' s D G s must be made fully responsible for their own exp end it ure , including financial control
A new independent a ud it system service must be set up
D G s must p ub lish their own ann ual account s so as to en able a clear i d enti fication of problem areas and set ann ual t ar get s for redu cing fraud and ir reg ular ities
In ret urn for this greater de g ree of a ut on om y, man ag ers must be made fully and person ally responsible for their actions
It is clear that the tr an sition to such a new system will take time
Ch ang es to the Fin an cial Reg ul ation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes
But while the Commission must ensure that it respect s the Treaty and the Fin an cial Reg ul ation in the tr an sition al ph ase , this must not be an ex cu se for in er ti a
U r g ent change is required today
Second , the fight against fraud , m ism an age ment and ne p o tis m must be strengthen ed, first ly by creating a culture in which they cannot th ri ve
This requ i res a clear example to be set by Commission ers and sen i or sta ff as well as ad equ ate training and second ly, by re in for cing the existing m ech an is ms for deal ing with fraud
OLAF , the Commission ag ency set up ear li er this year must be pla ced under the dire ction of an independent European public pro secutor whose job will be to prep are for pro sec ution by national criminal cour t s, criminal off ences comm itted against the financial interests of the Union by Members and official s of the European institutions
A proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of Article 2 8 0 of the Treat y, by the m id d le of this year
Th ird , standards in European public life must be up he ld
The political crisis which l ed to the down f all of the Commission ear li er this year clearly demonstr ated the need for un am b ig u ous and en for ce able rules of con du ct
A number of cod es have since been introdu ced
They must be assess ed by Parliament and should be made leg ally b ind ing
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most not ably the United K ing d om , and ins tit ute a committee for standards in public life , with a m and ate to give adv ice on prof ession al e th ic s and rules of con du ct in the European institutions
Wh ist le -b low ers who act in good fa ith must be prot ect ed
At the end of last year Mr K in n ock ann oun ced new measures for the protection of wh ist le -b low ers. They must be implemented without delay
Al though such measures can never be an al tern ative for good management , they must be an es c a pe val ve when something goes wr ong
C ru ci ally, reform s must not be limited to the Commission
Parliament must consider itself the need for improve ments to its internal rul es, administ ra tive proced ures and management prac tic es
Finally, the Commission' s human resour ce policy must be modern is ed. It is clearly no longer su ited to the requirements of a modern , mul tin ational organ isation
The social dialogue has often act ed as a b ra ke on reform and its over h a ul is long over d ue
A care er with the European institutions must become more att ra ctive
To o many y oun g , new official s are le a ving their jobs after just a few years
M er it must be recogn ised and re ward ed, specific s k ill s training should be a s ine qu a non for prom o tion to a high er g ra de
The prom o tions procedure must be made fa ir er and more transpar ent
L ast but not least the pay and benefit s p ack age must be review ed
It must become more flex ible and more responsible to l ab our market conditions
It must be r id of some of its more out d ated ele ments ; and it must deal with the leg iti m ate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil serv ants should be pa id an exp at ri ation allow ance inde f in ite ly in a Europe of open border s, or pay a level of tax es that is often well be low that of Member States
Commissioner K in n ock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform
This communication must contain a clear tim et able
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and run ning the moment um for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and prob ably ever will be
En l arge ment of the Union is just a few years away
N ow is the time for Europe to put its own h ouse in order ; to ins til in its institutions - as the independent exper ts might have said - a sense of responsibility
In J un e of last year Europe 's v ot ers g ave a clear sign al that they are f ed up with end less st or ies about m ism an age ment and ne p o tis m
There is a very simp le way to deal with those st or ies. Let us get r id of m ism an age ment and ne p o tis m
Mr President, I do not want to be mis u nder st o od - I s in c ere ly hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am , of course, in favour of comb ating fraud and firm ly support the appropriate , necessary reform s
This is not a st ra ight for ward issue and call s for a much more w ide - r ang ing analysis , but I shall restric t myself to ra ising only a few point s, in order to make people more aware , if possible , of what we are talking about
All the exper ts can provide information and new s, form ul ate opinion s and give adv ice , but, they have no political or ele ctive responsibility , and right ly so
I never thel ess believe that poli ti ci ans should look into what can be g le an ed from an exper t report and what cannot be taken en m as se in a spirit which, on some occasion s, I have f el t in the past and still feel to be s el f- d est ru ctive
I believe - and I shall only p ick up on a few ide as - that Parliament al one , and no one else , can ex er t an inf lu ence over its Member s. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and represent a tiveness would be serious ly under min ed in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward , as it should
It is just as important for no - one to be able to or have to ref use the European Parliament or its comm itt ees any document ation
Members of Parliament must pos s ess the qu al ities of mor ality , dis cip line and disc re tion over de leg ated issues inn ately, and these certainly cannot be imp osed on them by any one else
I would point out that there is no European legal system , but that a different legal system ex ists in each Member State
We run the risk of de leg ating issues relating to the same off ences which will then be p un ish ed in different way s
I agree that an inves tig ation system should be introdu c ed, but I am also absolutely conv in ced that we must recogn ise the right to equal respect for di gn ity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a def ence
I am opp osed to European Community official s being acc us ed of criminal act s at the d ro p of a h at : wh ist le -b low ing is a m eth od that has no place in the third m ill en n ium
In conclusion , Mr President, Parliament must introdu ce a principle of democracy : we must implement reform s which allow Parliament to grow and exp and its power s, not go into re ver se
This debate on the van H ult en report b r ings to a close one of the most tra um atic period s for the European institutions since their cre ation in 1 9 5 7
The ref us al of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the defin i tive ref us al for the 199 6 budget ; the motion of c ens ure tabled in this House a year ag o for differ ing reason s ; and the first report of the Committee of Ind epend ent E x per ts on the reform of the Commission which l ed to the m ass res ign ation of the Commission itself , are now part of European f ol k l ore
Th ose of us involved in these hist or ic event s are well aware that n one of the up he a val would have been caus ed had we not act ed with parliament ary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission oper ated
R e me mber that the Council of Minister s, abs ent again this even ing from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 199 6 - on the very day the Commission itself res ign ed on 15 Mar ch
N ow we come to the second report of the Committee of Ind epend ent E x per ts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and brief ly debate last S ep t ember
Our gre ates t concern in the E P P is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is rest ore d
F urther step s to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European pe op les per ce ive that there is no ad equ ate system of democratic account ability for over - z e al ous official s
U nder no circ um stan ces will we conc ed e ground which we have w on over the past few month s, which we believe to be in the interests of open ness and transparency
We are therefore concerned to see the f l ur ry of Commission ann oun ce ments in recent wee ks by Commissioner K in n ock sugg es ting policy proposals of various kind s to be put in a White Paper short ly
Wh ile con ve ying a des ire to proceed r ap id ly, it also gi ves the imp ression that the Commission is in trans m ission rather than list ening mod e
Our concern is strengthen ed if the r um our report ed a few day s ag o is true - namely that the Commission want s to limit sever e ly the access of Parliament to information
This was , after all, one of the caus es of the down f all of the last Commission
Ha ve the less ons not been le arn t ?
The know ledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negoti ated l ed to our dis ag ree ment with the rapporteur when we deb ated his report in committee
We could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be de me an ing for Parliament to set out detail ed instru ctions as to what we want ed the Commission to take up in its reform p ack age
The less precise , Mr van H ult en, we are in our resolution s, the more ro om it gi ves the Commission and your form er colleagues in the Council to do what they like
We believe the v ast number of recommend ations of the W ise M en ' s report should be implemented
We have , as the E P P - E D group , sub mitted all the recommend ations of the W ise M en ' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entire ly chang ing the nature of the van H ult en report in committee
We have res ub mitted a few amendments which fe ll in committee , in particular , our des ire to see the cod es of con du ct rev ised specifically to include the reference to m er it and man ag eri al cap ac ity which you, Commissioner, ac cep ted - when we had our hear ings last S ep t ember - should be included in these cod es of con du ct , particularly when consider ing app oint ments and prom o tion
L o ok ing to the future , we know that we are at the begin ning of a long process of continu ing reform in the European Commission
We want in particular to see the hard - work ing and high ly compe t ent n orm for Commission official s ac know led ged in the outside world - a rep ut ation that has been d ark en ed by the in app ro pri ate con du ct of a few individual s
Commissioner, you will be aware from your pres ence in the last Commission why the crisis occ ur red
In a n ut s he ll : there were programmes being run for which there were ins u fficient sta ff resources available
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real sta ff ing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible
Our position was made very clear on this top ic in the 2000 budget
We will be v ig il ant over the next five years to ensure the reform s now being suggest ed are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modern ise institutions
But , equ ally, we will not h es it ate to with d ra w our support finan cially or other wise should step s be taken which do not cor res pon d to the open ness prom ised by Commission President R om an o Prodi prior to his n om in ation
Let us hope that we can avoid institution al up he a val s by having an on go ing dialogue which ass um es from the out se t that Parliament will be an equal partn er in decid ing the out come of Commission reform
Mr President, I must start by ap olog ising that I cannot be ne ar ly as dra m atic as Mr E ll es in my present ation
C an I first thank Mr van H ult en for this report
It is an excellent report
It would have been wr ong for Parliament to have put in w il ly n il ly every single recommend ation that ca me from an ex tern al bod y because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues
It is right for us to have a focus ed report which is what Mr van H ult en has produ ced
C an I inv ite Mr E ll es not to put the car t before the h or se
Y es, a lot of things were lo st by the Social ists but they have not been w on in pl en ary yet , and may I w arn him that may not be the case tomorrow
I should like to thank Commissioner K in n ock for all his efforts so far
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produ ce a r ad ical change
C entral to this is the attemp t to produ ce and en g ender responsibility
It is clear that this needs to be develop ed at all level s and it needs to recogn ise the needs of each level within the Commission
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Fin an cial Reg ul ation
That is important
We need to st op people pass ing the bu ck from one to another
Wh ere fail ure is occ urr ing within the Commission we need to hold people responsible
We need to be ass ure d that cons ist ent under - per f orm ance must lead to dis m is s al
This is nat ural else wh ere but it seems to be an extremely r ad ical sugg es tion when it is put to the Commission
We cannot continue with a situation where inc om pe t ence, m ism an age ment and fraud are c os ting the European tax p ay ers money and provid ing them with a po or service
I will give you one example of this. In the 1998 Court of A ud it ors report an exchange r ate mis c al cul ation in relation to It al ian w ine cost the tax p ay ers of Europe G B P 8 to 1 0 million
It is clear that is not accept able
What happen ed to the person who was responsible for that mis c al cul ation ?
We need a system which provid es inc en tives and prom o tion and we need to see this prom o tion based on m er it
We recogn ise that most of the official s within the Commission are extremely hard - work ing
But we also recogn ise that some of the prac tic es are out d ated
We look forward to read ing the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail al ong side the Commission because , un li ke what Mr E ll es has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 Mar ch
We also need to recogn ise that people who live in g l ass h ous es should not th row st on es
The European Parliament has not exact ly been c le an in its approach to things throughout its hist ory
We have a long way to go before we are perf ect ourselves
Our own sta ff policy is out d at ed. S ome of our working prac tic es need r ad ical reform
I hope that the European Parliament will be h ang ing on t o the co at t ail s of the Commission in this reform process
We recogn ise the proposals on activ ity -b ased b ud ge ting . We recogn ise that means dis cip line on the part of Commission official s and we recogn ise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on dis cip line when we talk about ne g ative prior ities
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relations hip s with the public
European tax p ay ers need to be re - ass ure d
The f ate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, res ts on deli ver y of this reform
That is the key issue , deli ver y of these proposals
Mr President, I would like to start by ext ending my comp li ments to the rapporteur, Mr van H ult en, on his first report
I very much ad m ire him for keep ing his spirit s up at a time when he was in und ated with so many amendments
I think that the report dra wn up by the W ise M en has been use ful and I think that it is also use ful for this Parliament - as already st ated by Mrs M or gan - that we ourselves should ask for exper ti se from outside for once to see how our administration is run
We have sub mitted an amendment to this effect
F rom the many points made by Mr van H ult en in his report, I would like to high light a few , not necess arily in order of importance but just r and om ly
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper st or age of docu ments
The Commission' s rec ord s le ave a great deal to be des ire d
We no tic ed this when we had to inves tig ate the F le ch ard affair , which, as it happen s, has still not been s ort ed out
C ur ious ly, very important docu ments had g one mis s ing from the c ab in et s, even from those of the President and of various Dire ct or ates - G ener al , and this is clearly something which should not happen
If Parliament want to carry out proper ins pe ction s, these docu ments must be available , and I would like to know what the Commission intend s to do to improve this situation
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control
This has also been part ly deal t with in the van H ult en report
I think it would be use ful if we were to give report f ig ures per c ateg ory and per sector on how the budget is implemented
The general imp ression at present is that any thing budget - re l ated within Europe is b ad
It is clear that, over the past c ou p le of years, we have no tic ed an up ward tr end in agric ulture and a down ward one in structural exp end it ure
Is this possible ?
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it pres c rib e a de ad line by which the reform s have to be carried out
If we ad mit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first
Mr President, I would first ly like to thank Mr van H ult en
It is his first report here in pl en ary
This is worth a comp li ment although I regret , of course, that he did not exp ound it in his own m other t ong ue
It is a report which ca me about with difficult y and may well be too l ate
In my opinion, this is main ly down to the wr ang ling between the two major groups within our Committee on B udget ary Con t rol
Let us be hon est
The second report of the W ise M en ar ri ved in S ep t ember
We are now four months down the line
M e an wh ile , Mr van H ult en has been in und ated with amendment s, more than 1 00 amendments in the first r ound
He w ent back to work , re w ro te his report and to ok into account the very many sugg es tion s, but had to face ne ar ly another 1 00 amendments in the second r ound
My fear is that all of this has contrib ut ed to a report which is too detail ed, too ext ensive and too l ate
M ore over , I have been inform ed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all day s - on the reform of the Commission which will be dist rib ut ed for further consult ation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope
M ight Mr K in n ock be able to th row some light on the matter this even ing ?
Mr van H ult en, my Group of the G re ens and regional ists will support the attemp ts in tomorrow after n o on ' s pl en ary meeting to em b e ll ish this report
A fter all, it makes no sense to c op y the many s ound recommend ations made by the Committee of W ise M en word for word in your report
So tomorrow , if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraph s, this is certainly not on account of their cont ent but rather to r ender your report as a whole more read able
In any case, it should be clear that my group , of course, fully back s the recommend ations made by the Committee of W ise M en
In any event , I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in F e b ru ary
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the W ise M en and that of Mr van H ult en will become g au g es for our group , g au g es which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not
I would like to end on the following point
J ust as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and rele ased to public opinion with a clear de ad line stat ed, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is look ing for change and, in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 200 2
Mr President, this report is positive but, act u ally, we need more than this
F ra ud , m ism an age ment and ne p o tis m do not come from now h ere . They are most like ly to occ ur if there is little democratic control on cas h f low
V ia the structural fund s, a great deal of the European budget is being p u mp ed a round the system
This is only use ful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where r ich Member States contrib ute to both the re ven ue and development of po or er Member States
But there is also funding which is being p u mp ed v ia Brus sels back to the same r ich Member States
D ist ric ts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hand s on this by inves ting v ast amount s of money and man p ow er in l ob b ying and negoti ating
A fter each in cid ent of impro per use of this mone y, and certainly after fraud , the call for str ic ter control is more pr on oun ced
E ven the str ict est control cannot s ol ve this problem . It will , at best , lead to more bureauc ra cy and less ro om for local democracy and for people to get involved in ch o os ing and develop ing projects
It would be pre fer able if national governments ch an ne ll ed this money direct ly to their local governments without a European det our
In the next c ou p le of years, we will need to think about the possibility of rep la cing structural funds by an equal isation fund which is limited to budget ary aid for Member States or their constit u ent regions with a low inc ome per cap it a of the population
This is prob ably the only way to achieve less fraud , less over he ad s, more transparency and more democracy
Mr President, a year has not yet pass ed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to e val u ate the first and second report s differ ently
The first report was w ide ly public is ed, form ally deb ated and used - just like the cont ro vers y and new s le ak s which pre ced ed it - to make m ince me at , first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioner s, even though they had no connection with fraud , m ism an age ment or ne p o tis m
R ead ing now what happen ed then , not even a year ag o, it bec om es clear that that first report was intend ed to do any thing but s erve the cause of tr uth or reform , as is maintain ed today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more s al ient points - was comm ission ed with the precise m and ate not to address specific cas es, since there is no intention to follow up the off ences detail ed in this report
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, n or to the majority of the trade un ion s, who are bus y discuss ing the def ence of European public administ r ation, but, in practice , are o c cu p ied with the cor por ate protection of their own member s, put ting the w ide po w ers aff ord ed to them to d ub ious use
T ra de un ion representatives sit on the D is cip lin ary B o ard and the St a ff Reg ul ations Committee , there b y making it imp os sible to rem ove dis loy al official s and pres er ving the St a ff Reg ul ations in their f os si l ised state
In com p reh en sib ly, trade un ion representatives are also members of comm itt ees on competition , and I would not be sur pr ised if un ion members were already members of OLAF , there b y pla cing this institution which should , at least form ally, guarantee its imp ar ti ality , at great risk
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is us ually set a side for other activities and not for deb ates , discussion s and the exchange of information
Mr President, when it comes to put ting its own h ouse in order , the European Commission is in a C at ch - 2 2 situation
There is en orm ous press ure of expect ation following the event s that l ed to the res ign ation of the previous Commission
I some tim es have the imp ression that the more r ad ical the proposals made here in this Ch am ber s ound , the more app la use they rece ive
There again , it is simply not possible to change situ ations once and for all with a few st ro k es of the p en, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and get ting down to b r ass t ack s
This may explain why we experi en ced more difficulties than anti cip ated in the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol as regards this issue
N ever thel ess, the out come is now on the t able and there for all to see , and I would express ly like to thank Mr van H ult en for the work he has done on this report
Pro vid ed this report is not water ed - d own yet again by the adop tion of amendment s, it will aff ord us the opportunity to make clear and un am b ig u ous demand s of the Commission on a number of crucial points
A llow me to start with the most important demand
We do not want financial control to be ab ol ish ed
The financial cont ro ll er should still be able to make chec ks before funding commit ments or pay ments are made , not in every case, but where ver un c ertain ties or ris ks ar ise
The Commission is s ending out the wr ong sign als here , by r en am ing the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for Fin an cial Con t rol as the Dire ct or ate - G ener al for A ud it s, for example
It may well be e as y enough to change the Commission' s organ isation ch art but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal text s, particularly those relating to budget ary dis cip line
I do not have exact f ig ure s, but the Community ' s budget ary dis cip line and the as soci ated implementing provision s apply to al most 1 00 different areas of responsibility of the financial cont ro ll er, to his or her independ ence and the tas ks as si gn ed to this offic e
This cannot be i gn ore d or e v ad ed, certainly not on account of so ft law , as was once suggest ed at a meeting of our Committee
I r res pe ctive of such legal consider ations, it would be an un for g iv able m ist ake , under the circ um stan ces, to sc ra p financial control in the tra dition al sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are , at long last , no longer out on a li mb but set to become part of a ch ain of function ing superv is ory and inves tig atory m ech an is ms
As we see it, there will be a do ve t ail ing of three m ech an is ms in the future : a system of independent prior appro val by the financial cont ro ll er, conc om it ant and follow - up control by the internal a ud it service - also know n as the a ud it service - which has yet to be set up , and fin ally, there will be the t ar get ed tra ck ing - d own of ir reg ular ities by OLAF , the new anti -f ra ud offic e
It is to be wel com ed that Mr van H ult en ' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial short com ings li e, which must be t ack led
A few s al ient points : the dis cip lin ary proced ures are not taking effect , especially when it comes to call ing official s to account for their mis de me an our s, including those of a financial nature
There is a large gre y area and a great lack of cl arity where criminal s an ctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the ann oun ce ments made by the Commission are rather v ag ue
I can only emphas ise that these are the really hard n ut s that fin ally need to be c rac k ed
Mr President, first ly I would like to extend my hear t f el t congratul ations to my colleag ue , Mr van H ult en
It is a good feel ing to be able to say that he is from our de leg ation and I am , I think , en tit led to feel a little p rou d of him
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report
Mr President, the Commission' s res ign ation has also creat ed a culture of fear among st many official s within the h i er ar ch y and large bureauc ra cy
The call to make a cultural U - t urn and em b ra ce a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one
I have w it ness ed from close up within the De velop ment Committee how th ous and s of projects st ag n ate and how some tim es up to 8 0% of the money is not sp ent . S ome tim es, an en orm ous res erv o ir of money is creat ed, not because it is not des per ately need ed, not because there are no s ound proposal s, but because the whole system has co ll aps ed
A lack of responsibility , too much ex an te , not enough ex post and, as a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective sp ending
It would be mar ve ll ous if this report were to give the gre en light to result - or ient ed sp ending of this kind , with all the work organ ised on that basis
When the Commission' s first draft report soon bec om es the official report on 1 Mar ch , I very much hope that our in p ut here will help ensure that we will actually w it ness this change
With out any doubt , this will then be a service , Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produ ce , we will also reg ain and re - ac qu ire something which we have o st en sib ly lo st over the past c ou p le of years
This is the best support we can give to European democracy
If , in this way , we can move away from the culture of the f if ties and cross over into the next cent ur y, we are w it ness ing a very special moment indeed
Mr President, first of all, congratul ations to M ich i el van H ult en for his first report
It was a b ap tis m of f ire but we have a saying in the N ether land s appropriate for this occasion : in at the de ep end and you will s w im in no time
Mr van H ult en, I think you des erve a m ed al for your efforts
There are two points which, in my opinion, des erve special attention on the part of the E L D R
Firstly, there is the Commission ers ' individual responsibility
This must be regul ated during the IGC
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entire ly in the hand s of the Council and we have , therefore, sub mitted an amendment in which we ask whether an inter in s titutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall -b ack position and are not pla cing our f ate completely in the hand s of the Council
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleag ue , Mr M u ld er, the E L D R is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be inves tig ated by independent exper ts
This will contrib ute h uge ly towards re - est ablish ing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution
We at the European Parliament cannot be a cre di ble c oun ter p art to this reform ed Commission as long as we do not s earch our hear ts and put our own House in order as well
On ly when all European institutions are reform ed will we have the open , democratic and dec is ive Europe which our citizens now fin ally des erve
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van H ult en on this first p ie ce of work which he is pres en ting to the House
I am sure that it will s erve , among st other thing s, to make his second report more flex ible and for him to step up efforts to find a cons ens us among st the groups
At this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reform ing the Commission, demand ed by our citizens
This Parliament has often he ard the des ire to reform the Commission express ed, even by its President s
It now appe ar s that this des ire is more serious
A fter the res ign ation of a Commission and after a Committee of E x per ts has list ed an al most end less number of de fic i en ci es, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have prom is ed, on 1 4 S ep t ember , to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by F e b ru ary
This Parliament an x ious ly aw a it s this complete reform programme
The report that we are deb ating today intend s to give political force to many of the recommend ations of the Committee of E x per ts comm ission ed by this Parliament
Mr Prodi said he would act any way , that he pre fer red to get things right , but that fear of not get ting things right would not prevent him from ac ting
We therefore ask that his programme be a bo ld one and, if it is, I can ass ure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and ne ut r al man n er, but with political sense
Commission ers should not be considered sen i or official s but rather poli ti ci ans in offic e
Therefore , the report allow s them to be members of political par ties and to be members of political bod ies aff ili ated to their par ties
P er haps the reference to the post s is imp re c ise
I do not know your exact view in this respect , Mr K in n ock , but it is clear that we want Commission ers who are politic ally strong and politic ally comm itted
We want a structure which allow s every Euro to be sp ent effective ly, and our account s demonstr ate that this is not happen ing at present
Therefore , Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bo ld programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bod ies who feel that their stat us qu o is under threat , but not with this Parliament, which expect s prof ound and d ar ing changes
Mr President, the S an ter Commission ca me to g ri ef because financial control fail ed all down the line
Therefore , the future of this new Commission will dep end in no small measure on the extent to which reform s are s w i ft ly undert ak en here and financial control is back in working order
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already refer red to the fact that the Commission intend s to d r as tic ally improve and con so lid ate its follow - up chec ks and that these chec ks should be carried out on a completely independent basis , with no s w eep ing of matters under the car pe t in future
N at ur ally, this is only to be wel com ed
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a pr ice , as it were , that is, of having to disp en se with independent - and I st res s, independent - prior appro val
U p until now , the Commission' s pay ments could only be made when the author ising offic er sign ed the appropriate order and the financial cont ro ll er g ave his appro val in the form of a vis a
And so it is the " t w o key " principle that appli es here
A single key is to su ffice in future
The financial cont ro ll er is no longer to make adv ance chec k s, if all goes to plan as regards the reform s currently under discussion within the Commission
If you will par d on me for saying so , Mr K in n ock , what you are propos ing is a little like ab ol ish ing the polic e because they were un able to prevent cri m es
What we really need to focus on , however, is making the chec ks more effective
This could be achie ved by no longer ins isting , in future , that the financial cont ro ll ers f urn ish every single pay ment trans action with their appro val st amp
It is precisely those who feel the need to control every thing that end up cont ro ll ing nothing at all
Therefore , in future , prior appro val should take place in a t ar get ed man n er, that is, only in cases of un c ertain ty or risk
The official s responsible for financial control should be dep loy ed on a dec entral ised basis , that is, in the oper ational Dire ct or ates - G ener al , among st those of their colleagues that sp end the mone y, so that they are immedi ately available when problems ar ise and so as to r ender the chec ks less p on der ous and time - con s um ing
However, the financial cont ro ll ers must work independ ently
That is the crucial differ ence between our plans and those of the Commission, when it t al ks in terms of dec entral isation
It is obvious ly the Commission' s intention to make the financial control official s sub ordin ate to the individual Dire ct or ates - G ener al , but this is precisely what we do not want
S ure ly we have le arn t this much from the event s sur round ing the Le on ard o affair , when the internal exam in ers in the rele vant Dire ct or ate - G ener al iss u ed w ar ning s, but these were ne ither he ed ed n or pass ed on
Therefore , independ ence is pr ere qu is ite for effective chec ks
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol sub s c rib es to
Inde ed, the new Commission has now dec la red itself in favour of follow - up chec ks having this independ ence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior appro val to en j o y such independ ence as well ?
I believe we should set the se al on this point at tomorrow ' s vote
Mrs The at o has already expressed as much and I am only too will ing to support her in this regard
Mr President, a c ou p le of years ag o, the previous Commission t ried once and for all to t ack le r ig id and obs ol es c ent struct ures
This l ed to st ri k es and s me ar c amp a ign s by int r an si g ent trade un ion s, where u pon the proposals were ab and on ed and rep la ced by a wish y - w as h y comprom ise
This was st up id of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion
When I read Mr van H ult en ' s pass age about person n el policy, I am a f ra id that Parliament may again be fail ing to t ack le the crucial issues and just sp ou ting a lot of h ot a ir
There are too many right s, too many regulations and too little ro om for lead ers hip
There is no back b one , and no te eth
Wh ere is the be ef ?
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner : ple ase , deli ver the be ef even if it is B ri tis h
R om an o Prodi prom ised a rev olution
You have said some power ful and worth wh ile things your self , but take care now that you do not do d ge the crucial issues , the on es where it h ur ts !
S ort out the t ang le of sta ff allow an ces
St and firm on the demand for mo bility , not as a right , as it say s here in the report, but as a management to ol
En s ure too , that training bec om es a management to ol
Do not list en to the report ' s demand s that te mp or ary sta ff should have their employment confirm ed
It is the post s which should pos sib ly be made per man ent and not necess arily those employ ed on a te mp or ary basis
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the B ureau until six months ag o, I would urge you to address this issue in the B ureau so that we here in Parliament at least comp ly, in our own administ r ation, with the demand s we are making on others
We have not done this so far , and this is something you o u ght to be instrument al in chang ing
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van H ult en for his report and to say that I voted for it
So I refer to the things I do not agree with
I do not agree with the paragraph s in relation to Parliament
This report is about the Commission
Parliament is a s ep ar ate subject
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission
In addition to that, there is the question of d ut y -f ree
That was a s tic k used to be at the Commission by the d ut y -f ree l ob b ies who res ent ed the fact that the Commission ab ol ish ed d ut y -f ree in a ir port s
It is not worth y of being brought into this report either
M ost of the report is about financial control . That is reason able because it comes from the B udget ary Con t rol Committee
But we should not create the imp ression that v ast amount s of European resources are being put at risk by care less ness in the European Commission
A fter all, it is only 1 % of G D P , by comp ar is on with national sp ending
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are y oun g and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 8 0% of these resources are sp ent by the Member States
So care less ness within the Commission in the sp ending of money is not like ly to put at risk v ast qu an ti ties of money
We should get it into pers pe ctive . It is important to re me mber that
The business of the European Commission is very little about sp ending mone y. They have very little of it
They have a much w ider responsibility . That w ider responsibility concerns the management of the environment , food saf et y, fore ign trade , the internal market and so many other respon sib ili ties we have given them without the resources to deal with them
I am not one of the people who ag re es that there is a v ast lack of tr ust
If there is, we have gener ated it in this House in the past year
I have been here for 2 0 years and found absolute tr ust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament
We have had our problems and we recogn ised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureauc ra tic Commission was m ist r ust ed, doub ted and fe ared by the citizens of the European Union because they were m ism an ag ing our affair s
That is a g ross ex ag g er ation of what the difficulties were
This Commission should not have to live fore ver in the sh ad ow of the m ist akes that caus ed the res ign ation of the Commission that w ent before it
Wh ile there were problems - and we have to resol ve them in view of enlargement , for inst ance - we some tim es take the ne g ative s ide too far
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his sp l end id report
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work
The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of em erg ency seems to pre v ail in the Commission
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well
N at ur ally, there are good , cap able employ ees in the Commission, and they are in the majority
But we need r ad ical reform
There is too little action and too much un n ecess ary bureauc ra cy
Pe ople should have clearly - de f ined po w ers to take decisions for which they should also be account able
The Fin an cial Reg ul ation should be amend ed
We agree that we should have better control of the finan ces
It is just a question of how
The Commission and the Committee of Ind epend ent E x per ts are in favour of completely doing away with ex an te financial control
We should be careful about this. We should re tain some form of ex an te financial control
It is not enough simply to carry out sp ot chec ks once the money has been sp ent
This would allow too many an om al ous projects to s li p through
In st ead , we should be reform ing and dec entral ising control
The Commission does not have enough sta ff
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the c oura ge to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s sta ff resources are not at all ad equ ate for the tas ks which have been as si gn ed to it
And the Commission should be able to ref use new tas ks if it does not also get the ext ra sta ff it needs
The sta ff ing system is too r ig id
There should be a more f re qu ent r ot ation of employ e es, especially at the top of the h i er ar ch y
It should also be much e a si er to sa ck in e fficient and inc om pe t ent employ ees
I am therefore very pleased that the dis cip lin ary procedure is to be reform ed
A fter all, the very b ad experi ences so far with dis cip lin ary proceed ings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reform s
Mr President, Commissioner s, first of all, I cannot help but ref lect upon the fact that this is, on the whole , a D ut ch - B ri tis h - S c and in av ian debate where the speak ers are concern ed. P er haps this is a little wor ry ing
I hope , like so many other s, that the state of em erg ency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resol ved
We must get away from the idea that we are r us hing to put out a f ire in one cor n er, only then to have to r us h again to put out the next one
As Mr B l ak said, we must inst ead establish a system with clear r ol es
First of all, we need to u gh regul ations, which can be implemented
C od es of con du ct and e th ical comm itt ees are not enough . There need to be to u gh rules st ating , among other thing s, what may be dec entral is ed, what may be out s our ced and what is independent
I find it a little wor ry ing that people are cla m our ing for independ ence in this debate without def ining what it is in relation to which there is to be independ ence and without def ining what right of decision -m aking is to be ex erc ised
What we need , then , are basic administ ra tive regulations for the EU , for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States
These are what are mis s ing
We have asked for a Public Pro secutor ' s O ffice and criminal law , but we also need administ ra tive law for the EU
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt , as b ind ing regul ations, the o mb ud s man ' s proposal of a cod e of con du ct for good administ ra tive practice
The van H ult en report is a step in the right dire ction , but it is not enough
Secondly, we must also cl ar if y our own a ud iting r ol es
The Court of A ud it ors is to monitor the extent to which actions are inc om p a ti ble with the regul ations, but it should not exam ine the exp edi ency of a particular action
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political e val u ation
We do not h un t down criminal s. That is OLAF ' s job
T e ll me what national parliament , for example, is hand ed all pre li min ary inves tig ation docu ments
Ob s tin ate as I am , I also want to say that the regulations govern ing public access to official rec ord s must be clearly better than the draft which has been cir cul ating on the Intern et . O ther wise , we shall not get any wh ere in this fight
Mr President, I would like to extend a w arm thank you to the rapporteur for his report
I am pleased that I can address him now in D ut ch , now that Mr V an d en B erg has just done so
O ther wise I prob ably would have f el t s light ly gu il ty about this
I would like to say that this report represent s a h uge improve ment , also with its amendments
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteur s on our committee are always p rou d to rece ive 1 00 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an inter es ting top ic
I think that this is also the case here , but I think it would be a b it over the top to sp end too much time talking about these 1 00 amendments
I would also point out that our coordin ator on the B udget ary Con t rol Committee is Mr P om é s R u i z , who is S p anish and has h ence made a major contribution to this debate from a S p anish pers pe ctive
Mr President, one of the key aspect s which have been mentioned is, to my mind , the rapporteur ' s proposal for the stand ing committee on standards in public administration
A very important proposal indeed
I am only very sur pr ised that the Social ist group would like to sub ordin ate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs M or gan , because she want s to sc ra p it al t og ether
I cannot fully gr as p the under ly ing r ational e
On the one hand, we rece ive all kind s of words of p ra ise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs M or gan want s to purs ue a s ort of sc or ch ed ear th policy on this point and on other key points as well , as a result of which, in fact, the entire cont ent of this report v anish es
I do not know whether this is to appe ase Mr K in n ock , but I happen to know Mr K in n ock
He is happ y to hear what our demand s are and is quite prepared to be flex ible if he con sid ers it necessary
In my opinion, such a far - re ach ing sc or ch ed ear th policy is really un n ecess ary
Finally, the issue of official s
A ct u ally, I do not entire ly share Mr Ha ard er ' s view
I do agree that the sec tion on official s has , in fact, been comple ted tot ally in ade qu ately
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphas ised
Secondly, all kind s of proposals are never thel ess being mo ot ed, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are ter rib ly appropriate and whether they would lead to improve ment
For example, we are currently look ing into T A O s. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to ab ol ish te mp or ary sta ff at the Commission
These two consider ations are di am et ric ally opp osed to each other , and I really fail to gr as p how such a proposal can end up on the t able
Mr President, ever since P l at o ' s ' R ep ublic ' , the W es tern world has reg ular ly been te mp ted to rep la ce government by the people with government by exper ts
Our Parliament first asked exper ts to help it e val u ate the perf orm ance of the European Commission and they to ok adv ant age of this inv it ation to deter min e, themselves , what its future should be
In this second report, the exper ts have g one a step further and critic ised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have h es it ated to rem ove the European Commission from offic e, since they sh ared the political aff ili ations of some of its member s. The exper ts think that this problem will be resol ved by ban ning the Commission ers from be l ong ing to political groups
A cc ord ing to the exper t s, Parliament should no longer have the power to superv ise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life , and this should be a stand ing committee , not elect ed, pres um ably made up of another group of exper ts
In this, their second report, the exper ts tell us that It aly is finan ced by the C o hesion Fund , that the E R D F and the Social Fund represent two - th ird s of the Structural Funds and that the principles of addition ality and comp lement arity in the Structural Funds come to the same th ing. They tell us that the farm ing l ob b y is for cing us to fin ance rural development through the E A G G F - G u arant ee and that the principle of partnership only appli es to the Commission and to the Member States
This less on in w is d om is 1 00 % ide olog y and 0 % know ledge
This will not help us to reform the European institutions wh il st fully res pe c ting democratic institutions
The van H ult en report st ar ted out as a bri ll i ant one and I would like to pay de ep and s in c ere t rib ute here to what Mr van H ult en achie ved
Un fortun ately, it was then chang ed, and chang ed for the wor se , which turn ed it into a document which in fact, propos es something that we cannot accept
Mr President, Mr van H ult en, your work is worth y of being qu al if ied as enter p ris ing, ar du ous and comple x , and I believe this is important in a first report
P le ase therefore accept what I am about to say as being critic ism made in the spirit of hon est debate , and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be r ich er
This report seems to me to be red und ant , long - w ind ed, conf us ed and lack ing in acc ur ac y in the terms used
P er haps ' red und ant ' is the most serious e p ith et , and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament
That is to say, if this Parliament comm ission s a Committee of E x per ts - and I am not going to repe at what Mr C as ac a has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analy se a problem , where is the sense in ind ul g ing in the m ed ie val tra dition of critic ising the critic s and so on , ad inf in it um
C lear ly we are aw a iting this reform from the Commission, we are aw a iting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them
M e an wh ile , we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence
' L ong - w ind ed '
I am not going to mention the l ength of this report
I do not know if it b re ak s the rec ord for all the resolution s presented here , but, for this type of resolution it certainly does
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produ ce comple x resolution s - which has had paragraph s of more than 1 6 l ines without a single full st op
It is also ' con f us ing '
I am not going to ret urn to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report
And fin ally, Mr President, f r ank ly, I am not going to give examp l es, but there are many cases in which legal l ang u age is used with an al arm ing lack of acc ur ac y
Therefore - in su m m ary - I aw a it , and many of us aw a it , your report, Commissioner K in n ock , so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the d ut y of this Parliament
Mr President, the scope and high ly detail ed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reform s are
When one con sid ers the event s that have set these end e a vour s in motion though , it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them
H op es and expect ations were raised high er still by the strong m ess ag es s ent out by Commission ers Prodi and K in n ock in pl en ary and in the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol
The con cept of transparency stand s out in the report
Sec uring this is a major priority
The importance of sm o oth - r un ning , compreh en sible work cannot pos sib ly be emphas ised enough
This is not just about bureauc ra tic reform , how ever ; rather , it is about show ing good will towards the citizens
We must w in back their fa ith in EU politic s
The citizens demand r ap id and open access to the institutions and call for EU provision s to be compreh en sible to them
This is what en abl es them to understand what is going on . They want to see the politic s of success and believe that this is how any politic ally mat ure citizen could expect to be s er ved
Wh ether or not the reform s suc ceed dep end s, to a very large ext ent, on the Commission' s own initiative
However, it ann o y ed me when I he ard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the inter im report with Parliament on an inform al basis
However, Mr K in n ock , your present ation to the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol this coming T ues day must not just be a one - way st re et ; rather , as Parliament ar ian s, we want , and must , play a part in this and it also goes against my understand ing of politic s when I find that yet another press con ference has taken place this week , before we have had ch ance to careful ly discuss the sub m ission in the compe t ent Committee on B udget ary Con t rol
I believe , Mr K in n ock , that not w ith stand ing all the success achie ved on a person al level , the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satis f y our jus tif i ably high expect ations
C an I begin by st ating for the rec ord and for the en light en ment of Mrs L ang en h ag en that the decision for me not to address the full pl en ary tomorrow and therefore be available for form al respon s es on the report is not m ine and not the Commission' s - it was the decision of this Parliament !
So if she has any l ect ures to offer they are best contain ed within this House
S he know s me well enough to understand that at all st ag es in the five years in which we work ed together in this House , there has never been a single occasion on which I have ref us ed to account in full , form ally and in detail for every thing I have done
Mr President, may I begin by pay ing t rib ute to the p ain st aking and, from what I hear , the p ain s - ac cep ting work of Mr van H ult en in prepar ing his report
Al though new to this House he is re lative ly old in some respect s, certainly in his fam ili arity with the In s titution s as a form er official - and I think that the value of that is sh own by his ab ility to t ack le the comple x subject which is of cri tical importance , as several Members have said, to all of our In s titution s
I thank him and I wish him a long and dis ting u ish ed care er as a represent ative
Mr President, as you will know , Mr van H ult en 's report on the second report of the Committee of Ind epend ent E x per ts is necess arily long and, since I want to make a compreh ensive rep ly, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control , I seek your ind ul g ence
N at ur ally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of E x per ts last S ep t ember , I pl ed ged on behalf of the inc om ing Commission that the report would be treat ed as a fundamental in g re di ent in the Commission' s reform proposals
Our efforts to completely hon our that pl ed ge will be e vid ent to the House when consideration is given to the reform p ack age that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demand ing tim et able that we set for ourselves four months ag o
I am sure that Mr P om es R u i z is encoura ged by that
The great majority of the p aper 's proposals are close ly a k in to those put by Mr van H ult en and that p aper includ es - I say to him and to Mr St a es - a very exp lic it tim et able of actions to be undert ak en in purs u it of reform
There is nothing therefore that is open - end ed or v ag ue about the report which I have had the hon our to comp ile
The considered view of this Parliament in the consult ation period over the next four to five wee ks will for obvious reason s be of great signific ance
I would say to Mr E ll es that we are most defin ite ly in list ening mod e
But he will app re ci ate - with his c ust om ary gener os ity I am sure - that for us to be able to list en to the response to what we are propos ing, it is first necessary to trans mit what we are propos ing
H ence the trans m ission
Th ough time for b id s me , Mr President, from comm en ting in this debate on each e lement in the resolution before the House , I read ily give the ass ur ance that the detail s will be treat ed as an important in p ut into our reform proposals throughout this consult ation and indeed to our work in other rele vant areas
Tur ning to the main them es of the resolution I offer the following obs erv ations
The need for transparency is right ly stress ed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission oper ates will improve the efficiency and will also dem y s tif y what the Commission does
This is essential for an ex ec u tive administration that must be account able , not just to this House , but more gener ally to the European public
N at ur ally, sen sible saf eg uard s are required to prot ect speci ally sen si tive inform ation, but the cases where these are needed should be k ep t to the min imum possible
I have repe ated ly emphas ised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 2 5 or 3 0 years of c amp a ign ing
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission
Fin an cial management and control is obvious ly a crucial area of reform
As the House know s and has repe ated ly said, the sc al e and scope of the Union 's financial inter ven tions have g ro wn im men se ly in the past dec ade without a prop or tion ate increase in sta ff ing or an ad j ust ment in proced ures
S ever al Members have made that point again in the course of today 's debate
We share the view, force ful ly expressed by the Committee of Ind epend ent E x per t s, and repe ated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a th or ough over h a ul of our rules and proced ures
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a r ad ical rec as ting of the Fin an cial Reg ul ation in A pri l
Parliament ary support in purs u ing that essential course for change will be absolutely v ital
I share the view expressed by Mrs The at o that it would not be accept able in any way at all for us to seek to oper ate new ar r ange ments without a change in the law
Ch ange in the law is fundamental
There are prepar ations which can be made and they are speci f ied and set out with the full reas s ur an ces in the reform strateg y, but en act ment of change in the legislation is obvious ly of fundamental importance to the oper ation of the new system
E s s enti ally - and with legal change - the Commission will system atic ally move away from the current central ised system of prior appro val of each financial trans action by the Fin an cial Con t ro ll er and inst ead strengthen the internal control system s within sp ending dep art ments so that Dire ct ors - G ener al are better equ i pp ed to take responsibility for decisions with an imp act on the European Union budget
In addition , and to achieve better ass ur an ces than those provided under the present system , the new system of dec entral ised control s must be comp lement ed by set ting up an internal a ud it service - " th e second key " as H er r B ö s ch said, established in a way that is close ly cons ist ent with the recommend ations of the Committee of E x per ts
That service will open on 1 M ay this year
It will be he ad ed by a prof ession ally qu al if ied member of the a ud it prof ession and its independ ence must and will be guarant e ed through a new provision to be add ed in the financial regulation
The new service will report to me and it will be acc om p an ied by an A ud it Pro g ress B o ard ch a ire d by my colleag ue , Mrs Sch re y er, who I am de light ed to see in the Ch am ber this even ing
As B udget s Commissioner, here respon sib ili ties already include relations with the Court of A ud it ors
This A ud it Pro g ress B o ard will ensure effective and r ig or ous follow - up to internal a ud it s
I want to emphas ise strong ly that chang ing our control system s will defin ite ly not mean re la x ing them
The proposed change will make the system s more effective , both in terms of in p ut s and in terms of measure d and account able out com es
I can also specifically ass ure the House that we are not going for what is some tim es call ed " a b ig b ang approach "
Fin an cial control ' s ex an te vis a for each sp ending dep art ment will only be rel in qu ish ed as and when the internal control system in a dep art ment is sh own to be fully ad equ ate
I am some wh at sur pr ised that paragraph 1 0 of the draft resolution does not appe ar to address the fundamental critic is ms of the current central ised financial control function made in both report s of the Committee of Ind epend ent E x per ts
That committee was very clear about the need to ab ol ish the central ised ex an te vis a
It was clear too on the need to s ep ar ate internal a ud it from financial control
In addition , I do not believe that paragraph 1 0 fully ref lect s the opinion of the Court of A ud it ors in 1997
N at ur ally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Fin an cial Reg ul ation but it is use ful to rec all Mr K ar l s s on ' s comments to this House last month
" T he Commission' s internal control " he said " is not force ful enough in pre ven ting incor rect oper ation
For inst ance, the Fin an cial Con t ro ll er grant ed a positive a prior i vis a in most of the cases of m ism an age ment or ir reg ular ities rec ently un c over ed
At the same time, the internal a ud it function is carried out in an un c o ordin ated way by several bod ies, not ably the same Fin an cial Con t ro ll er, the In s pect or ate G ener al and by some un it s oper ating Dire ct or ates - G ener al . "
The central ised ex an te appro val system was doubt less ly o ri gin ally design ed to ensure careful ness but, over the years, it has had the per ver se effect of redu cing the extent to which man ag ers feel responsible for their decisions
I do not believe that there is any real dis ag ree ment between us on this
I take it from paragraph 1 0 that the under ly ing pre oc cu p ation of hon oura ble Members is that there should be a careful ly man aged tr an sition
That will most certainly be the ch ar ac ter of the change as hon oura ble Members will see when they read the reform strategy document
Our objective , the committee ' s objective , the Court of A ud it ors ' objective is not to ab ol ish financial control , it is to get r id of and improve upon central ised financial control
B e fore le a ving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal a ud it function must be maintain ed p ending the establish ment of the new independent internal a ud it service in a matter of months
Tur ning quickly to the sec tion of the resolution on f igh ting fraud , cor ru p tion , m ism an age ment and ne p o tis m : the major new proposal of the report concerns rep or ting by Commission official s of per ce i ved wr ong - d o ing
As I made clear in the hear ings last S ep t ember and on other occasion s, we are at one in the belie f that there is value in def ining the best possible m ech an is ms for this purp ose although obvious ly we all hope that it will r are ly be needed
S ince J un e of last year , the OLAF regulation has given better guid ance to sta ff about rep or ting possible ir reg ular ities
We propose to comp lement those provision s by def ining the rights and oblig ations for official s to report su s pect ed wr ong - d o ing through internal ch ann els but not exc lu sive ly within the same h i er ar ch ical line
The possibility of using speci f ied ex tern al ch ann els will also be address ed
We are seek ing to implement best practice
S eri ous response to report s, confid enti ality at ear ly st ag es and care er protection will be ass ure d for people who report wr ong - d o ing in good fa ith and in way s that do not comprom ise inves tig ations by un ti mely disc l os ure
As a cor o ll ary , there will be saf eg uard s for official s who are the subject of f al se al leg ations
A communication l ater this year will give full detail s
I do not think Parliament will be dis app oint ed by what we will propose . I am pers u ad ed, however, by the sugg es tion in paragraph 3 4 of the report on using ex tern al bod ies to en for ce existing provision s on financial liability
We already plan to reform the existing dis cip lin ary proced ures to ensure th or ough n ess, fa ir n ess, cons ist ency and prof ession al ism
And we will propose the establish ment of an inter in s titutional D is cip lin ary B o ard - something else on which we will need the support and understand ing of Parliament
A communication in J un e will set out the full proposal for change
St and ard s in public life is the next main sec tion of the report before the House
With the introdu ction of a seri es of cod es of con du ct the current Commission has be g un to develop an exp lic it e th ical framework
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in J un e for an inter in s titutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life
That is in line with the draft resolution
An important role for the committee will be to give adv ice on e th ic s and standards and to superv ise common and s ep ar ate cod es of con du ct for the institutions
I welcome Parliament 's support for that
We are also currently exam ining how we can most effective ly implement the proposal for a cl as si fication system for document s, made in paragraph 5 0 of Mr van H ult en 's report
The draft resolution right ly rec all s the Commission' s account ability to this Parliament
President Prodi and V ice - P resid ent de Pal a ci o and other colleagues have demonstr ated the Commission' s practical commitment to that
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a cod e of con du ct on relations between our institutions which will include up d ated rules on access to docu ments
The point was very proper ly raised by Mr E ll es and refer red to by Mrs Th ors
I am sure they are aware that in m id - D e ce mber we offic i ally received the draft framework agreement with Parliament
We are now w a iting for Parliament to dec ide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text
We are very happ y to proceed as r ap id ly as possible
The report right ly emphas ises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform
I am g l ad to say to Mr van H ult en and Mr Ha ard er that the detail ed recommend ations on rec ru it ment , tra in ing, app ra is al and the app oint ment to management posi tions are very much in line with our own think ing and our own proposals
I also want to move towards a l in ear care er system because the current c ateg ory system is no longer ad ap ted to the needs of our institutions
It certainly b l oc ks the adv ance and mo bility of people with pro ven cap ab ili ties
Member s, who , in the course of this debate , have proper ly p ra ised Commission official s, who in the great majority and ty p ic ally are of high integr ity , hard - work ing and of great cap ability , are absolutely right in the comments that they have made
Wh ile the reform strategy White Paper will clearly out line our ide as on these and other point s, detail and prec ision are obvious ly essential
A seri es of communic ations will therefore follow in the coming month s. E ach of them will be available for ref le ction and response by this House
It is, mean wh ile , very obvious that we will need to work close ly with Parliament, as an institution , on central matters of common interest , not ably pay and p ension s and the re vision of the sta ff regulations
On this l at ter point we are ref le c ting on whether it might be use ful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on lead ing issues like pay , condition s, sta ff represent ation rights and so on , but en abl es the different institutions to oper ate implementing rules on other matters
The ear ly thought s of Parliament on this consult ative idea would be especially welcome
I conclud e by refer ring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resour ce requirements of our policies for change
That is most certainly rele vant
We are sure that there will be an important " re f orm di vid end " as the modern isation measures begin to fo ster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources
It is very clear , however, that part s of the Commission services are already very st ret ch ed
Parliament has f re qu ently made that point
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new invest ment in training for s k ill s and in techn olog y
Th ird ly, it is very clear that increased prepar ations for enlargement must be undert ak en
They are already having imp lic ations for resour ce avail ability
It is also clear that if we take on new tas ks - which we will sure ly be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to i d enti f y so -c all ed " n eg ative prior ities " and d ro p those ne g ative prior ities in order to create sp are cap ac ity
A central fe at ure of the reform will therefore be a more r ig or ous process for t ying the process of priority - se t ting into resour ce alloc ation under a system of activ ity -b ased management
I want to emphas ise , however, that wh il st internal dis cip line on priority - se t ting will certainly be introdu ced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equ ally str ing ent at tit ud e to the demand s made on the Commission
The Commission therefore wel com es paragraph 15 of Mr van H ult en 's report
I conclud e, Mr President, by thank ing the House for its attention during an un a vo id ably l ength y speech and by express ing s in c ere g ra tit ud e to the rapporteur, to the Committee on B udget ary Con t rol and to the other comm itt ees which g ave their opinion s
We look forward to working close ly with this House on the final isation of the reform strategy p ack age and then , most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation contin ually through the years that will be required on such comple x ities
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m
( T he sitting was cl osed at 1 1 . 1 5 p . m. )
M id d le East peace process ( con tin u ation )
The next item is the continu ation of the Council and Commission state ments on the M id d le East peace process
I am very gr ate ful to the President of the Council for the statement this mor ning on the M id d le East at the begin ning of this debate and for hear ing some of Minister G am a ' s in si ght s, as he ar ri ved h ot -f o ot from the region
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European R ec on struction Ag ency on Mon day me ant that I could not take part myself in that t ri p to the M id d le East , even though , as I mentioned ear li er in the day - which is another st ory - event s cons p ire d to mar o on me at M un ich a ir port rather than transport me to Th ess al on i k i
S uch is life
I hope that hon oura ble Members will ex cu se me if I am not able to st ay to the end of the debate as I would , in all n orm al circ um stan ces, wish to do
The debate was f i x ed for this mor ning and on that basis I had ar r ang ed to see vis it ors from the B alk ans this even ing
So I hope I can count on the understand ing of the House on this occasion
It is not something , I ass ure you, which I would wish to make a practice of
Li ke hon oura ble Member s, I welcome the United States ' efforts that have re la un ch ed the Syri an / I s ra e li negoti ations, despite the Syri an decision that they needed more time before res um ing the t al ks that were sch ed ul ed to start again today
There is reason able hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be bu il t in the ne ar future
I also hope that progress in the Syri an tra ck will p ave the way for an ear ly res u mp tion of Le ban ese / I s ra e li t al ks which could then adv ance in par al le l towards an over all deal on Israel 's relations with its n ort her n ne igh bour s
At the same time we must not l ose s ight of the Pal es tin ian tra ck
The situation of the Pal es tin i ans has always been the c ore issue of the conf lic t
A fa ir and, inde ed, gener ous deal with them remain s the key to l as ting peace in the M id d le East
Israel is and Pal es tin i ans have made substan ti al progress in implementing the S h arm el - S he i k h M em or and um
Al though there has been some s li pp age , I tr ust that the remain ing Isra e li t ro op red ep loy ments will materi al ise soon
S im ilar ly, despite the indic ation the day before yesterday that the tim et able for the F ra me work Ag ree ment on per man ent stat us has been p us h ed be y ond the m id - F e b ru ary de ad line , I very much hope that the much more important S ep t ember de ad line for the final agreement on per man ent stat us will be reached
I was reas s ure d that this was also the view of P ri me Minister B ar ak and President A ra f at , when they m et on Mon day
H on oura ble Members will know that one particular concern of our s has been that there should be a res u mp tion of progress on the mul til ater al tra ck
This is far from st ra ight for ward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close li a is on with the U S and R us si an co -s pon s ors as well as the regional par ties
We are ch ar ged with particular responsibility for the prom o tion of regional economic development
The begin ning of the t al ks with Syri a pa ved the way for a con ven ing of the mul til ater al st e er ing group in M os c ow at the end of the month
I look forward to att ending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to p us h things forward again
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace proces s, as all s id es - Pal es tin ian s, Israel is , their A ra b ne igh bour s and the United States - have ac know led ged
N or is our role conf ined to that of b ank er
We must be prepared to act s w i ft ly to support the con so lid ation of peace in the region
But we should not k id ourselves : a compreh ensive M id d le East peace deal comes with a he ft y pr ice t ag
The Commission is already consider ing the imp lic ations for the European Union of the recent encoura g ing develop ments
We intend to share our more detail ed thought s on the matter with Parliament and Council soon
But let me remind hon oura ble Members that the European Union is no s l ou ch when it comes to financial support for the peace process
We are the l ar g est of all d on ors to the Pal es tin i ans
We have also offer ed very substan ti al support to J ord an , Le ban on , Syri a and E g y p t
With the Israel is we have established clos er cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them
The Community contribution of over EUR 6 00 million in grant s and lo ans between 199 4 and 1998 effective ly under p in n ed the Pal es tin ian authority and contrib ut ed substan ti ally towards the recon struction of the det eri or ated ph y s ical inf ra st ruct ure in the W est B ank and G a z a
European Union Member States together contrib ut ed another EUR 8 6 0 million during that crucial period
In this context , let me app la ud the important step s that the Pal es tin ian authority has rec ently taken to improve budget ary transparency
President A ra f at will be meeting the Council of Minister s next week
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take sim ilar ly c oura ge ous step s to improve the Pal es tin ian administration and to b ol ster the r ule of law
The Commission is active ly involved in those efforts
The Commission has also st e pp ed up its plan n ed support for regional cooperation projects between Israel is and A ra b s
We comm itted more than EUR 2 0 million for such projects last year
This p ack age included renew ed assistance for people - t o - pe ople activities and cross-border cooperation where Israel is and A ra b s meet on non- governmental and exper t level s
Members will rec all that the European Union is the l ar g est financial d on or to the over all efforts in bring ing recon ciliation to the people of the M id d le East
A number of issues nat ur ally em er ge as addition al potential t ar get s of Community support in the coming ph ase of the peace process - among them , help ing to con so lid ate a G ol an set t lement both in terms of contrib u ting to security ar r ange ments and supp or ting de min ing and the re b u ild ing of commun ities in the G ol an He ight s
Syri an economic development will need assistance for the tr an sition from a w ar ti me to a peace economy
R ec on struction and re h ab il it ation of s ou ther n Le ban on , the only M id d le East ern area with an on go ing m il it ary conf lic t , will also demand consider able efforts
We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Le ban on as a whole
A solution is needed to the Pal es tin ian refuge e problem - these are the l ar g est group of refuge es in the world , number ing ne ar ly 5 million people - an indic ation of the en orm ous chall eng es a he ad
We must support initiatives increasing the avail ability and impro ving the dist rib ution and management of the region 's very sc ar ce water resources
L ast ly, but may b e most important ly, we are encoura g ing clos er regional cooperation in a number of areas, bring ing all the countries concerned together in a joint end e a vour to address their common problems
It is already app ar ent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be su fficient for the m ag n it ud e of support that will be required in the event of per man ent peace
I want to under line that point
I wish ins ist ently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary , Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a g ap to develop between our r h et or ic and what we are actually cap able of doing
I repe at that a change in the politic s of the M id d le East will require a g ear change in the support that we shall be asked and expect ed to provide
I hope I can add that we will want to provide that
We have made progress in recent months and week s, as Mr G am a mentioned ear li er
But it is in e v it ably going to be a to u gh process with difficulties and dis app oint ments on the way
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the oblig ations and chall eng es that will be creat ed by that out come
L ast ly, I will repe at for some who have enter ed the Ch am ber in the last few min ut es, what I said at the out se t of my rem ark s : that I will not be able to st ay until the end of the debate , large ly as a result of having ass um ed that the debate was taking place this mor ning and having f i x ed a meeting on the B alk ans for this even ing
I hope the House will understand that
Mr President, Commissioner P at ten has our understand ing
I would like to tell him that communic ations with Mad ri d are us ually more f lu id and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon
The state ments we have he ard today on the M id d le East peace process are very opportun e at the moment because of the h ur ried to ur which Minister G am a - whose abs ence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region , acc om p an ied by other Council representatives
The t one of the new s in the medi a on the recent event s in the area could lead us to take a p es si m istic view of the situation
I hon est ly believe that an e val u ation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation
In this sense , I share Commissioner P at ten ' s positive at tit ud e
Let me explain : it is true that the Isra e li Government has delay ed the third hand - over of W est B ank ter rit ory to the Pal es tin ian authorities
It is also true , however, that, since the sign ing of the S h arm el - S he i k h agreement s, 3 9 % of the ter rit ory of the W est B ank has been hand ed over to the Pal es tin ian N ational A uth ority , together with two third s of the G a z a St ri p and, more important ly, this agreement has so far been sc ru pul ous ly comp li ed with , since , under the terms la id down in S h arm el - S he i k h , the Isra e li Government has the right to delay that hand over
This is nat ur ally on the condition that the delay does not ex ceed three week s, as P ri me Minister B ar ak has prom ised
On the other hand, the decision to delay the second r ound of talk s, initi ated in S h ep her d st own by the Syri an A ra b Rep ublic , is u nd ou b ted ly significant , but I am conv in ced that the h op es which were raised on 3 J an u ary in that to wn will not be d as h ed
Mr President, the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are t abl ing a motion for a resolution , in this ever cont ro ver si al debate , which is the result of a broad cons ens u s, seems to me to demonstr ate the clear political will to dec is ive ly support open peace process es
I would therefore like , equ ally firm ly, to express our re jec tion of the use of vi ol ence to resol ve differ en ces, which are still no doubt prof ound , between the par ties
In my jud ge ment , this constit utes a guarantee to both s id es, both from a political and a financial point of view, of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guarantee ing security in the area and to cooper ating in the development which is needed to he al the serious social differ ences which exist
But this also s er ves to make a cla im , on the part of the European Union, for a de g ree of political participation in the process which is cons ist ent with its economic contribution - we do not have as p ir ations to be b ank ers - and which will be su it ably vis ible to the public
There is absolutely no doubt that the forth coming t ri p by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contrib ute to this
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner P at ten for his detail ed account
I should like to say that I agree with the t one which G al e ote Q u ec ed o ' s speech set here . We in Parliament strong ly support the M id d le East peace process
It is, of course, a peace process which is fin ally under way
If we think of how the process was look ing a year ag o, the differ ence between then and now is like that between n ight and day , despite difficulties and delay s
I want to emphas ise four point s. First of all, the S h arm el - S he i k h Ag ree ment contain s, as everyone know s, a conc re te tim et able for the implementation of Israel ' s commit ments
This appli es both to the inter im agreement and to the He b ron and W y e Ag ree ment s. Wh ile the negotiations on the final peace set t lement have be g un , I think it is important to keep the two process es ap art
A lack of progress in the final stat us negotiations should not j e op ard ise implementation of the three above -m ention ed inter im agreements
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the h ar bour s in G a z a, the n ort her n trans it r out e between G a z a and the W est B ank , further rele as es of political pr is on ers and implementation of the financial commit ments
The second point rel ates to Syri a. There , the border question is obvious ly central
How negotiations are proceed ing there , we still do not know
What is important , however, is that they have be g un
An important question in this context is the future dist rib ution of water
As things are at present , the G ol an He ight s account for between a third and a six th of Israel 's water supp ly
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syri a which are close ly link ed to the issue of Isra e li with d ra w al from S ou ther n Le ban on
A cc ord ing to U N I F I L , there are now conc re te sign s that Israel is prepar ing to with d ra w , which is something we welcome
There too , of course, out stand ing matters in disp ute are the water problem and the situation of the Le ban ese Pal es tin ian refuge es
My last point concerns the future Pal es tin ian State
This may be pro c la im ed in the course of this year , with or without Israel ' s support
The B ar ak government has given to understand that it intend s to conclud e a peace agreement with a state as the other party
E ven if negotiations are not comple ted by S ep t ember of this year , there is nothing in the rele vant t rea ties to prevent a Pal es tin ian state from being pro c la im ed after that d ate
In this context , it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Pal es tin ian state that the l at ter should be as Commissioner P at ten said, namely a state subject to public control , and that it should be a democratic state
This is something to which we all want to contrib ute
Mr President, I would like to refer , first ly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be la id down to r ound off this debate
My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, need less to say, appro ves of it. M ore specific ally, however, I would like to express our de light at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syri a are on spe aking terms again to resol ve their differ ences of opinion
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a per man ent peace in the M id d le East
It is, therefore, regret t able that these peace t al ks have been su sp end ed for the time being
Inde ed, both par ties will need to make h uge efforts
L as ting peace in the region can only be achie ved by means of an agreement which guarant ees the security of the Isra e li border s, as well as Syri a ' s integr ity
It is also necessary to initi ate per man ent di p l om atic relations and to establish con st ant dialogue
In addition to the b il ater al meeting s with Syri a, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Le ban on within the fore se e able future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooper ation, a mul til ater al approach will appe ar possible
N ever thel ess, it is still regret t able that the European Union, one of the most important financial d on or s, is still un able to play a major political role in the peace process
This peace process in the M id d le East is one of the prior ities of the European Union' s common fore ign and security policy
This is where Mr S ol an a, the H igh Rep resent ative to the Council, could come into his own
The Commission and Member States also have to be encoura ged to support projects which can help develop understand ing and partnership between the different n ations in the region
I should also draw your attention to the signific ance of the B ar ce l on a process which should have a bene fic ial imp act on regional cooperation
In this respect , we support L ib y a ' s particip ation, provided that it recogn ises human right s, r en oun ces support for terr or ists and fully support s the peace process
There are still , need less to say, many un res ol ved problems and un ans wer ed question s, also invol ving the Pal es tin i ans
E ver y one know s that the peace process is a prot ra ct ed and difficult affair but we are conv in ced that, with the necessary tr ust , per se ver ance and ind is p ens able political will , our common go al , namely a peace ful and pro sp erous M id d le East , will be achie ved
Mr President, it is ple as ing that, despite certain delay s and problem s, the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Pal es tin e and between Israel and Syri a
The moment of tr uth is approach ing
Is Israel prepared to comp ly with the U N ' s resolution s and, in exchange for peace and security , hand back the A ra b areas which were con qu er ed in 1 9 6 7 ?
W ill Israel let Pal es tin ian refuge es ret urn or be given comp ens ation ?
W ill Israel share J er us al em and the water of the R i ver J ord an ?
W ill a free Pal es tin e be a t ru ly democratic state and, therefore, re li able as a partn er in peace ?
W ill Syri a fully accept Israel ' s exist ence and introdu ce democracy and the r ule of law ?
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process li es with the o c cu p ying country , Israel , does not prevent the A ra b partners from also having a consider able share of the responsibility
Pe ace in the M id d le East concerns us all, how ever
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a g od p ar ent to the Pal es tin ian state
Ag ain st this back g round , I want to conclud e with a rem ark able st ory from S w ed en where an international Intergovernmental Conference on H it ler ' s ex ter mination of the J e w s is being held , which is obvious ly a welcome initiative
Of 4 7 states inv ited from all cor n ers of the world , not one of them , however, is an A ra b state included in the EU ' s B ar ce l on a process
This has been inter p re ted as indic ating that the A ra b at tit ud e towards Israel should be regard ed by European s as being sim ilar to the N a z is ' anti - S em iti s m , which of course is completely incor rect
The A ra b world ' s critic ism of Israel has been found ed upon the same s ort of anti -c ol on ial ism as , for example, Al g eri a ' s fight for freedom against France
But today, E g y p t , J ord an and Pal es tin e have peace t rea ties with Israel
I therefore w on der whether Commissioner P at ten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have inv ited at least one A ra b state to the h ol oc a ust con ference in St ock h ol m
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner P at ten very much for the aw ar en ess he has demonstr ated of the difficulties in her ent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to comple tion
It is time to end the e ra which be gan with the B alf our dec l ar ation in 1 9 1 7 and the A ra b - I s ra e li w ar of 1 9 4 8 . It is time there were sec ure b ord ers and political , social and economic rights in every country in this region , and that human rights were recogn ised and up he ld in Syri a, Pal es tin e, Israel and every wh ere else
This is an ex erc ise in so ver e ign t y, and in democracy for each population and every individual , but to this end it is v ital for all par ties in the conf lic t to have the c oura ge to st ri ve for peace and right s, and to recogn ise the other as its partn er and not as its subject to wh om conc ession s must be given
I refer princip ally to the Pal es tin e - I s ra el question , but the same also appli es to the terr itor ies which have been o c cu p ied in the G ol an since 1 9 6 7 and in s ou ther n Le ban on since 1 9 8 2
Israel has to accept its respon sib ili ti es, with d ra w from the o c cu p ied terr itor ies and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be saf e and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area
However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security
The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Pal es tin ian s, who are still living under m il it ary o c cu p ation and whose l and even today is still conf is c ated in areas B and C , despite the O s lo Ag ree ment and sub sequ ent agreements
B et ween the period when the O s lo Ag ree ment was sign ed and 1 7 O ct o ber 1999 , 1 7 4 0 00 d un am s of l and were conf is c at ed, 8 4 6 2 of which have been taken under Mr B ar ak ' s Government
T re es have been up ro ot ed, h ous es are still being dem ol ish ed and, above all, water supp lies have been redu ced or ref us ed, especially in East J er us al em , while the set t le ments continue and are grow ing con st ant ly
N ever thel ess, there is no doubt that with the ele ction of the new government , positive step s have been taken : negoti ations, at least , have res um ed
But in the M id d le East , there can be no st able and l as ting peace if the Pal es tin i ans do not have their own state , if they cannot move free ly within their own ter rit ory
All the international community has to do is implement R es olution s 3 3 2 , 2 4 8 , 2 4 5 and 1 9 4
We are concerned by the de fer ment of the build ing of relations with Syri a, as well as Mr B ar ak ' s decision to post p one the with d ra w al of the Isra e li ar m y and the S h arm el ­ - S he i k h agreements
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which mat ch es its economic aid
We cannot be cont ent with a role back st age . We must be lead ing prot ag on ists while st ay ing off a co ll ision course with the United States, as Minister G am a said
Mr President, first ly my than ks and app re ci ation to Commissioner P at ten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace proces s, and for re a ff irm ing that our role is not only that of " b ank er " for the entire oper ation
I was de ep ly dis app oint ed at the new s this week that the peace t al ks between Israel and Syri a had been su sp end ed
I very much hope that a comprom ise can be reached to over come this so that the peace negotiations can be res um ed at a very ear ly d ate
N ever thel ess, we cannot d en y that some positive political progress has been made in the M id d le East of l ate
The fact that the Syri an F ore ign Minister and the Isra e li P ri me Minister were rec ently sitting a round the same t able in Am er ic a for the first time in their res pe ctive hist or ies is an indic ation that old h at red s and an im o si ties can be over come
P o li tical lead ers must show real c oura ge to put in place a framework which can lead to an over all peace set t lement within the M id d le East
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syri a and Israel , the Isra e li P ri me Minister will still face real opp o sition to any new agreement with Syri a in any future refer end um
The set t l ers at the G ol an He ight s will demand to be comp ens ated and there will have to be guarant ees of security
If Syri a would be will ing to offer conc ession s on the security question then the pro s pect s of a successful resolution to the Israel / S y ri a question might be prom ising
On the issue of Pal es tin e, I recogn ise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspect s of the W y e Ag ree ment
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of red ep loy ment , as well as the trans fer of terr itor ies
The low level of rele as es of Pal es tin ian pr is on ers and the fact that the Isra e li Government appe ar s to intend h al ting implementation of build ing per mit s already grant ed, as well as not appro ving new on es, po se further ob st ac les
These issues have clearly been hold ing up progress on the per man ent stat us negoti ations, although , I believe , these t al ks will not be held up inde f in ite ly
At present , the main difficult y in approach ing the negotiations seems to be that the Pal es tin i ans are ins isting that the border issue must be ag reed upon first , while the Isra e li Government say s that it should be set t led only if a solution is reached on the issue of set t le ments and security
C urr ent ly, both s id es seem to have ac cep ted that nothing will be ag reed until every thing is ag reed
In conclusion , while other countries in the M id d le East have had res erv ations about the over all dire ction of the peace proces s, now that the Syri an Government has been brought into the peace proces s, E g y p t and other countries in the region are will ing to move forward
I s in c ere ly hope that, in the interests of impro ving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the M id d le East , all the key prot ag on ists will move forward quick ly, in the very ne ar future , so as to reach an over all agreement on all the key matters which need to be resol ved
Mr President, the various mo tions for resolution s tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the M id d le East
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syri a, but only a few focus on the real problem at the hear t of the M id d le East issue
Inde ed, the time has come to resol ve a central problem for global st ability
The time has come for Israel to fulf il its prom ises of old and defin i tive ly with d ra w from the o c cu p ied terr itor ies, at last recogn ising once and for all the authority of Pal es tin e, whose res um ed di p l om atic activ ity will have a sec ure future while it is under the w ise lead ers hip of Y ass er A ra f at
It is equ ally important not to l ose s ight of the I ra q question , which no one discuss es any more, there b y re leg ating the problems of million s of women , e ld er ly people and ch ild r en, the vic ti ms of an em b ar go as ar ro g ant as it is w ick ed, to ob li v ion
I do not know what Syri a and Israel will want or be able to do in reality , but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it att ach ed the same importance to pe op les ' li ves as it does to the bal la st s of the co ld , col our les s, ar ti fic ial ne on b ul b s in our l amp s, which can i ll um in ate h ous es but not the world in the third m ill en n ium
Mr President, the Isra e li author , Am os O z , man aged to cap t ure very ap t ly the i cy at m os ph ere at the negoti ating t able between the Israel is and Syri ans rec ently
He was under the imp ression that the Syri ans thought that, in exchange for the G ol an He ight s, all they had to do was to fa x the Israel is a rece ip t
O z ' s imp ression is also e ch o ed in the Isra e li press
It contra st s P ri me Minister B ar ak ' s person al peace efforts and the dist ant at tit ud e, even ph y s ical abs ence, of the strong man of D am as cu s, President As s ad , at the negotiations in the United States
S ure ly As s ad would be B ar ak ' s ide al negoti ating partn er and not the F ore ign Affairs Minister
And the Israel is were certainly not imp ress ed by the disc our te ous beh av i our of Minister F ar ou k al - S h ar a in S h ep her d st own
H is beh av i our towards P ri me Minister E h ud B ar ak was pl ain ly ins ul ting
But why pay attention to such detail as basic di p l om atic n ice ties in the face of a to u gh negoti ation process over ter rit ory ?
We ll , the Syri ans are quite pos sib ly c ut ting off their no se to sp ite their face
At the end of the day , Isra e li v ot ers can still express an opinion on the ret urn of the G ol an
All the resolution s sub mitted express the s in c ere wish for greater European involve ment in the peace process
It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brus sels can make available the b illion s of do ll ar s which the Isra e li and Syri an authorities require from their peace p at ron , the United States, not to mention the he av y, equ ally cost ly, security guarant ees in case of an Isra e li with d ra w al from the G ol an
I would like to fin ish off by ask ing the European Council and Commission a question . How acc ur ate are the press report s which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pl ed ged t ro op s as a peace k eep ing force in the G ol an ?
Mr President, the tr uth is that the new s of the inde f in ite su sp ension or delay of the t al ks between Syri a and Israel is not good new s, but n or is it good new s that the day before yesterday there was another b om b att ack which in j ure d 1 6 people
It is clear that, for once , the United States has not been able to sec ure progress on the rest ar ting of these negoti ations, and it is true that the ob st ac les are difficult to over come : the Syri ans wish to reg ain so ver e ign ty and j ur is dic tion over the G ol an He ight s and re - est ablish the b ord ers which exist ed before 4 J un e 1 9 6 7 , while the Israel is wish , since they consider that it su it s their situation better , to have the b ord ers which were set in 1 9 2 3
The su sp ension of the t al ks between Syri a and Israel is not the only delay aff ec ting the peace process in the M id d le East
The application of the framework agreement between the Pal es tin ian authorities and Israel is also su sp end ed at the moment
A fter the t al ks which to ok place the day before yesterday between the Isra e li P ri me Minister and the L ead er of the Pal es tin ian A uth ority , the Isra e li P ri me Minister reques ted a delay of two months as from 1 3 F e b ru ary , the de ad line for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the W est B ank and the G a z a St ri p
What can the European Union do in these circ um stan ces ?
Un fortun ately, very little
It nat ur ally has to support these negoti ations, s pon s ore d by the United States ; cont act s have to be increased ; the pres ence of the European Union env o y, Am b ass ad or M or a tin o s, who has fulf ill ed his m ission with great di lig ence and efficiency , within the po w ers of the European Union, is positive
But n one of this h id es the fact that there is a certain sense of imp ot ence, because when the negoti at ors from each s ide f ly back to the United States this week end , we will have to re me mber that, for every 1 00 do ll ar s sp ent on the peace process in the region , 6 0 are contrib ut ed by the European Union
When we consider that a con ference will soon be held in M os c ow , it bec om es clear that the European Union' s pres ence in this peace process is some wh at p iti ful
I would like to ins ist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role , that it is time to take over and to sec ure greater participation for the European Union in this process
I hope that the forth coming vis it by the President of the European Parliament to the region , as well as the presid ents of the rele vant inter p ar liament ary de leg ations, will begin an e ra of greater initiative and a greater pres ence for the European Union in this comp lic ated and difficult peace process
Mr President, Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, Commissioner P at ten , I should like to thank you for your statement s, especially Commissioner P at ten , whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repe at any of his ide as
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner P at ten will perhaps see as sim ilar but which, for various reason s, a Member can form ul ate more open ly
First , I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Pal es tin ian authorities
But we have enough agreements now : O s lo , W y e P l ant ation, S h arm el - S he i k h
We have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented
However, in this regard I share Mr S al a f r an c a ' s s cep tic ism when he say s that there has been b ad new s from Israel this week , namely that the S h arm el - S he i k h M em or and um cannot be implemented within the set time f ra me
My second point concerns the res u mp tion of negotiations between Syri a and Israel
I consider this to be very encoura g ing new s
But we have also le arn ed this week that Mr B ar ak will not be tra ve ll ing to W as hing t on and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continu ed
I should like to make it quite clear : if the G ol an He ight s are ret urn ed to Syri a, the problem in this region will be s ol ved
On the question of the refer end um which various Members have refer red to : we must consider if a refer end um always needs to be held in order to hon our oblig ations under international law and under the law of n ations
In German y, there would prob ably be d an cing in the st re et s if we were to say that we were hold ing a refer end um on pay ments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay
That would be a sim ilar situation
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr M or a tin os ' special m ission has play ed in the region and the funding which we have provided there , Commissioner P at ten
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includ es your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to fin ance it
But we must also play a political role and Mr M or a tin os cannot play that role in this region on his own ; the Presidency of the Council must take action , the EU H igh Rep resent ative for common fore ign and security policy must tra vel to the region and we must do as the R us si ans did and inv ite the prot ag on ists of the peace process ourselves
Th en we will have play ed the role which is comm ens ur ate with our participation and our contribution
Mr President, Commissioner P at ten , the recent peace t al ks be g un in the U S A between Israel and Syri a mark a t ur ning point in the hist ory of the M id d le East . It has taken f i ft y years to reach this point , which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations
There will be no meeting today in S h ep her d st own but we must hope , as Mr P at ten said just now , that this post p one ment of the negotiations due to Syri an requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the M id d le East
This hope is contain ed in our motion for a resolution . We hope for a fa ir and bal an ced agreement based on respect for so ver e ign ties and the right to live sec ure ly within saf e and recogn ised b ord ers
All the fore ign t ro op s, including therefore the Syri an for ces, must with d ra w from Le ban on in accordance with R es olution 5 2 0 of the United N ations Sec urity Council
D are we hope for an Isra e li with d ra w al from S ou th Le ban on by J u ly 2000 , the d ate prom ised by E h ud B ar ak ?
D are we hope for a d ual peace agreement between Israel and its ne igh bour s to the n orth ?
We really hope and believe so
N ever have the par ties been so deter min ed
One fundamental point to be stress ed is the bal ance which must be expressed in the m ess age from Europe and which must exist between the people . There must also be a political bal ance between the particip ants in the negotiations
F o llow ing the att ack in H ad er a on Mon day , we must repe at our con d em n ation of any form of terr or ism
In terms of bal ance, or should I say im bal ance, I must add that it is to be regret ted that Europe is still play ing a min or political role in resol ving this conf lic t
At m id day , Mr G am a refer red to the financial and comm er cial support provided by Europe to the region
D es pite every th ing, we are being for ced to recogn ise that the res u mp tion of the peace process is large ly due to the work of W as hing t on
Li ke other A ra b countries before them , the Syri ans ch ose the Am er ic ans to s pon s or the negotiations
This was the ch o ice also made by Israel where Europe su ff ers from a par tis an public im age , and this is a fact, not a jud ge ment
This is now the opportunity to re iter ate to Mr P at ten , Mr S ol an a and Mr M or a tin os how much we are re ly ing on their efforts to include Europe in the s earch for a peace ful solution to the conf lic t
Al though it is difficult for Europe to speak with one v o ice about the peace proces s, it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity
The next item is questions to the Council ( B 5- 00 4 0 / 99 ) and the Commission ( B 5- 00 4 1 / 99 ) , on behalf of the Committee on C itiz ens ' F reedom s and Right s, Justice and H ome Affair s, on the 1999 ann ual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (A r tic le 3 9 of the T E U )
Mr President, 1999 was the year of the ent ry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , of the commun iti s ation of the Sch eng en Ag ree ment and of the E xt ra ordin ary T amp ere Council
These have been the most important mom ents in the Council ' s exp ression of its political will to establish an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union
The Council has decid ed to draw up a ch arter of citizens ' rights - and we re j o ice in this ; it has decid ed to implement Article 1 3 of the Treat y, comb ating all for ms of discri mination and xenophob i a, and it has decid ed to appro x im ate the law s on conditions for ad m ission and res id ence, as well as guarantee ing res id ents treat ment which is fa ir and on an equal fo oting with the citizens of the Union
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initi al proposals for civil cooperation
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affair s have been provided with a Community framework
They have been put into the hand s of a single Commissioner, Mr An t on i o V itor in o, and we congratulate them on this as well
F urther more, they have taken on the task of creating a " s c ore b o ard " to ver if y the progress made in this area at Community level , but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decision s, despite the fact that, for this House , the Treaty of Amsterdam included one dis app oint ment : that of delay ing, for five years, our role , our ab ility to particip ate active ly, to democratic ally control this area of freedom, security and justice , as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice
However, if , on ver if ying the progress made during 1999 , which is within the compe t ence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treat y, we le ave behind the stage of great dec l ar ations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out , the sc ene look s consider ably d ark er, Mr President
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hand s and what one sign s up to , the other be g r ud g es
D es pite all the commit ments made at the high est level , the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had env is aged
Pro gram m es mul ti p ly and over la p and there is no way of as c ertain ing level s of implementation and effec tiveness or , at least , this Parliament is un able to do so
We have presented the Council with a seri es of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them
We hope that this presid ency will mark the begin ning of a change of at tit ud e on the part of the Council towards this Parliament
I said that there was no cons ist ency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out
There are doub ts in my Group and doub ts also pers ist in this House , for example, about something which should be good new s : the incorpor ation of the Sch eng en Ag ree ment into the Community framework
Sch eng en has been incorpor at ed, as we said ear li er, into the ac qu is , but it has been done with very little transparency
N ot a single p ie ce of inform ation, n or a single consult ation, has been address ed to Parliament during this process ; ne ither on the as soci ation of the United K ing d om , n or on the incorpor ation of G ree ce , n or on the negotiations with N or way and I ce land
The same is true with regard to immig ration policy
We have am us ed ourselves with a p ile of report s, but we have no idea what has happen ed to these initiatives ; they have dis ap pe ared
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action , in the same way that 1999 was the year for expect ations
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament
The Council has decid ed that justice and home affair s policy must form part of the structure of the Union
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decision s, or it can continue to mis er ably be g r ud ge its as soci ation with the other institutions in this v it ally important project
If it ch o os es the second approach , it must be aware that this present s ris ks and that it will weak en the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is bu il t
Al tern ative ly, it could accept the offer of an agreement among st the institution s, in order to move forward in another way
F ul f il your oblig ations to Parliament in a gener ous spirit , th us prepar ing for the future
Pro vid e the Commission with the necessary resources and recogn ition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to ver if y the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States, and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at T amp ere and move towards a Union which is f re er, more just and more sec ure
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is rather mo ving for me to ret urn to this House in my cap ac ity as a Member of the Council
I was one of the first Portuguese Members of this House who , in 1 9 8 6 , to ok the first step s towards the integration of Portug al into the European Union, and I have to say, Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, that the experience I g ain ed here , political experience , has been extremely important in my life , and that the information we g ain ed and the contribution that we were all able to make towards build ing Europe defin ite ly mark ed the years that I sp ent here , and indeed my life
So it is with some pri de and satis f action that I find myself here and able to meet up again with some of my colleagues from those day s who are still in this House
The point I wish to make is that the Portuguese Presidency - to which the Minister for Justice , who is hand ling the field of justice and home affair s, and I myself both be l ong - wishes to us her in a new e ra with this Parliament, and to fo ster the relations hip between the Council and Parliament. This will in e v it ably be inf lu en ced by my parliament ary experience in this House , and of course by the parliament ary experience of that great Member of our national Parliament who is now the Minister for Justice and my colleag ue
We g ave an ear ly sign al when , before the start of the Portuguese Presidency , we m et with the President and V ice - P resid ents of the Committee on C itiz ens ' F reedom s and Right s, Justice and H ome Affairs in Brus sels
We were able to inv ite the Ch air man of that committee , Mr W at s on , and some members of the committee to come to L is b on , and to present our views concerning the role of the Portuguese Presidency in this area to them
And we g ave an undert aking then that I now want to repe at form ally : during all meeting s of the Committee on C itiz ens ' F reedom s and Right s, Justice and H ome Affair s, a represent ative of the Council, at political level , not an official but a political represent ative of the Council, from one of our ' c ab in et s ' , will always be involved in the work of the committee
(A pp la use )
and when ever the committee think s f it , and the Ch air man reques ts it, I myself or my colleag ue , the Minister for Justice , will come to Brus sels to take part in the work of the meeting
We will according ly give the Ch air man of the Committee on C itiz ens ' F reedom s and Right s, Justice and H ome Affairs the provision al ag end as for the Council meeting s in Mar ch and M ay , to allow cont act to be established before h and on the subject s to be discuss ed in the Council. We will do this today
Tur ning to 1999 , we find ourselves in the special position of taking st ock of the German and Fin n ish Presid en ci es. I would like to start by saying that, in addition to the rep lies that we shall be gi ving here to Mrs T er r ó n i C us í , who has presented a proposal on behalf of her committee , we shall also be let ting her have a wr itt en rep ly at the end of these discussion s
F urther more, I would like to say that the Council belie ves that 1999 was an important year in the field of justice and home affair s
C o oper ation in the field of justice and home affair s was not able for the significant changes w rought by the Treaty of Amsterdam and, as a consequ ence, for the incorpor ation of Sch eng en into the Community framework
The German Presidency had an important task in this respect in achie ving the tr an sition from the M a ast r ich t system to the Amsterdam system
Th en there was the la un ch ing of Euro p ol soon after the start of the Fin n ish Presidency , on 1 J u ly 1999
There was also a third not able event : the T amp ere S um mit , a European Council dev oted exc lu sive ly to justice and home affair s
The T amp ere S um mit was mark ed by a new spirit and by a deter mination to put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of the political agenda and to keep it there
The point that the Portuguese Presidency wishes to re iter ate here is that we intend to keep issues conn ect ed with the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of the presid ency ' s political agenda
As regards our rep lies to Mrs T er r ó n i C us í , I shall tr y to respon d to her questions on home affair s, and my colleag ue will then address the points relating to justice
As you know , the Sch eng en ac qu is appli es in full to t en countries, and in the course of 2000 , work will be done with a view to reach ing a decision on the ac qu is coming into force in D en mark , Fin land and S w ed en, and also in I ce land and N or way
The Sec ret ary - G ener al of the Council has p ub lish ed a colle ction of docu ments cover ing the entire Sch eng en ac qu is , p ending public ation in the O ffic ial J our n al once all the trans l ations are available
This colle ction is, at present , available in six l ang u ag es and the remain ing trans l ations are ne ar ing comple tion
A not her issue I wish to ra ise concerns programmes in the field of immig ration and asylum and how they apply to the C E E C s
In Mar ch 1998 , the Council adopted the O d y s se us programme, a programme of tra in ing, exch ang es and cooperation in the field s of policy on asylum , immig ration and cross ing of ex tern al b ord ers
It appli es to the f i ft een Member States of the Union and provid es for applic ant countries, and pos sib ly third countries also , to be as soci ated with it
This programme co vers the period 1998 to 200 2 , and the reference amount for its implementation is EUR 12 million
A pp lic ant countries can be as soci ated with projects se lect ed by the management committee as long as this comp lies with the objectives of the programme
The financial en vel ope env is aged for 2000 is EUR 3 million
U nder the 1999 programme, the Commission received 8 0 applic ations for fin ance, tot all ing EUR 7 . 5 million , against a budget for 1999 of EUR 3 million
The Commission proposed support for 3 5 project s, of which 12 were for EUR 5 0 0 00 and 2 3 for amount s over EUR 5 0 0 00
With regard to the O I S I N programme, and I am now refer ring to the 1997 budget year , projects were adopted for s em in ar s, tra in ing, exch ang es of official s, research and stud ies, and oper ational actions
Of 6 2 projects in all, se ven included applic ant countries
As regards S I S , the Sch eng en In f orm ation Sy stem , I am pleased to report that the Member States were very positive about its oper ation and use
The increase in the number of positive results demonstr ates the efficiency of the system and there is a continu ing increase in the number of report s
With a view to develop ing a c ust om s information system , agreement was reached with the Commission on a system which will per mit provision al application of the Con vention on the C ust om s In f orm ation Sy stem as soon as a certain number of countries have ra tif ied this con vention
Mrs T er r ó n i C us í also mentioned an inter in s titutional agreement
I o u ght to comment on this final point once my colleag ue , the Minister for Justice , has sp ok en, but it is obvious that what I shall say is the result of an exchange of imp ression s within the Council, and in particular between the two of us
I refer red ear li er to a new relations hip with the Commission and with Parliament, with a view to achie ving clos er link s and provid ing Parliament with time ly information on subject s to be discuss ed by the Council. I would now like to state before you here that we firm ly intend to consult the European Parliament, not only in those cases sti pul ated by the Treat y, which we are oblig ed to do , but also to inform and consult Parliament when ever we believe that it is appropriate to w id en this type of consult ation, and when , in direct cont act with the Commission, we believe that Parliament should be able to present its opinion
As regards inform ation, we will communic ate with Parliament on all matters which are important for establishing the area of freedom, security and justice . This partnership between the Council and Parliament, build ing on the Commission' s role and the excellent work Commissioner V itor in o has always done , will make it possible for the Portuguese Presidency to represent a l and mark in establishing this area of freedom, security and justice
( S ustain ed app la use )
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I do not have a back g round as a Member of the European Parliament, you will understand that it is even more mo ving for me to be here than it is for my colleag ue F ern and o G om es
As Mrs T er r ó n i C us í said in her speech , 1999 was a year of great expect ations in the field of justice and home affair s - an expect ation real ised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , an expect ation real ised with the conclusion s of the T amp ere Council, and a fundamental expect ation, as from this year , that will be real ised in the form of specific actions
We are all aware that, to this end , it is essential for the Council to appro ve , as quickly as possible , the sc ore b o ard which Commissioner V itor in o has the re mit of establish ing. I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency ' s ear n est des ire for political agreement to be reached on the sc ore b o ard at the inform al Council in L is b on on 3 and 4 Mar ch
Tur ning to the specific questions that Mrs T er r ó n i C us í has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas : the fight against organ ised crime , the oper ation of the J ud ic ial N et work , particularly as regards criminal matter s, and questions on Euro p ol
Reg ard ing the fight against organ ised crime , 1999 mark ed the implementation of several important actions st em m ing from the V i en n a action plan , which result ed in the sign ing of the Ch arter of European Pro f ession al As soci ations, in develop ments in cooperation and in establishing points of cont act between the Member States for recei ving information rele vant to the fight against money l au nder ing
And I must not for get the Fin n ish Presidency ' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the M ul ti - d is cip lin ary Group
This is an area in which we must carry forward and int en si f y our work , not just by sec uring appro val for the EU strategy for the fight against organ ised crime in the new m ill en n ium , but also so as to over come the difficulties as soci ated with the di ver g ence of views that exist s, particularly at Council level , on issues concerning the fight against organ ised crime
With this in mind I must emphas ise the importance we att ach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency , with the aim of organ ising a J um b o J H A - E CO F I N Council
If this is not to be a mere medi a event , it will need to be careful ly prepared by a joint committee , the comp o sition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organ ised crime
H ere , in addition to the work being done in the group of exper ts on the P re - A c ces sion P act , it is important that it has pro ved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organ ised crime between the European Union and the R us si an F eder ation, a plan which is now being final is ed, and to organ ise meeting s of li a is on official s from the Member States, in M os c ow , and to develop a set of further initiatives
A not her area is EU involve ment in the United N ations Con vention against Trans n ational O r gan ised C ri me and its various prot oc ol s, and in the con ven tions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe, in particular on c y ber crime
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affair s programme, the presid ency belie ves that it is worth wh ile , bear ing in mind the principles of Ch ap ter V I of the Treat y, to expl ore su it able means of provid ing the European Parliament with impro ved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United N ations Con vention
With regard to the J ud ic ial N et work , significant progress has been made , in particular the la un ch at the end of 1999 of the d ed ic ated te le c omm un ic ations system of the European J ud ic ial N et work , wh il st the M ul ti - d is cip lin ary Group has develop ed a seri es of actions to implement the 1997 action plan
However, we must stress that it is v ital for appro val to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new m ill en n ium , so as to give a f res h im pe t u s, while pres er ving continu ity , to the work done under the previous action plan
S ti ll on judicial cooper ation, consider able progress has been made on the legal protection of the e uro , and the European Parliament is being consult ed on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance
We believe that if legal protection of the e uro is to be cre di ble , we must avoid having a mul ti p lic ity of instrument s, and we should according ly make a comb ined effort in Mar ch to appro ve a single instrument cover ing all necessary aspect s, including those fe at uring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adop tion the Commission itself has call ed for
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the m ut ual recogn ition of judicial decision s, and we believe that on the basis of work already done , it will be possible , at least in the field of se i z ure of as se t s, for measures to be adopted in the ne ar future to provide for m ut ual recogn ition of judicial decisions
L ast ly then , Euro p ol , which st ar ted its work in 1999 . The Council approved a set of instrument s, with which Parliament is fam ili ar , to make Euro p ol ' s oper ations vi able but, of course, the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Euro p ol still remain , and these are issues which have nat ur ally taken on a new di men sion in view of the political decision taken in T amp ere to re in for ce Euro p ol ' s po w ers and, above all, to give it an oper ational di men sion
The French Presidency has pass ed an important working document to us which set s out various sc en ar i os for address ing and resol ving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Euro p ol
The Portuguese Presidency will short ly be pres en ting a working document on the Euro j ust net work , since although it is not obvious ly necessary for judicial control of Euro p ol to be a matter for Euro j ust , this op tion cannot be rul ed out at present
For this reason , it is essential that the Council ' s deb ates on the future of Euro p ol and Euro j ust should be con du ct ed in par al le l , so that conclusion s can be reached in par al le l also
I believe that in this context , and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Euro p ol and Euro j ust , it will be possible for us to find an accept able institution al solution to the relations hip between the Council and Parliament with regard to Euro p ol
We are fam ili ar with Parliament' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council ' s legal adv is ers
I believe that it will be possible to find a defin i tive solution to this question as part of the process of resol ving the issue of democratic control of Euro p ol , and that this solution will encoura ge and re in for ce institution al cooperation between all par ties involved
Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wish ing to compe te with the Minister s as regards em o tion s, I have to say that I am not mo v ed, rather I am dist ur b ed to have two person al f ri end s in the presid ency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not al ter the s ep ar ation of po w ers which is essential for the proper function ing of the Union !
I would also like to thank Mrs T er r ó n i C us í for having asked the question which has given r ise to the first ann ual debate of this parliament ary term on the establish ment of an area of freedom, security and justice , and to thank all the Members who , in their various comm itt e es, have active ly particip ated in prepar ing this ann ual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliament s and of civil soci ety
In this first speech , I would like to share with Parliament the Commission' s view of the most important event s in 1999
I believe that I can say with conv ic tion and also with satis f action that 1999 was both a t ur ning point and a year of con so lid ation by the Union on issues of freedom, security and justice
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam ca me into force in M ay and this Parliament st ated that the most far - re ach ing innov ation in this Treaty was its recogn ition of the need to establish an area of freedom, security and justice
At the same time, it also represent s a qu ant um le ap in qu al it ative term s, and a l og ical and v ital step in the development of the Union, in the w ake of the establish ment of the internal market , the introdu ction of the single currency and the la un ch ing of a common fore ign and security policy
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee g en u ine freedom of movement to all citizens res id ing in the ter rit ory of the European Union, recogn ising that this is only mean ing ful if it is ro oted in a sec ure b ase , with solid found ations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have e as y ac ces s, on equal term s, and in which our citizens can have real confidence
The Union' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom, security and justice was confirm ed at T amp ere
I would like to emphas ise the strong political m ess age s ent out by the European Council, re a ff irm ing the importance that the H ead s of State and Government of the Union att ach ed to a fundamental project , together with various political guidelines and prior ities which will turn this area into a reality , following a prog res sive strateg y, within a time -f ra me of five years, and that, above all, the three comp on ents of this area should be in bal ance : freedom, security and justice
1999 was also mark ed by the German Presidency ' s initiative to draw up a European Ch arter of Fund amental Right s
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union' s development, it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a ch arter , so as to make them as vis ible and ac ces sible as possible to our citizens
As I have already said on a number of occasion s, I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of draw ing up a ch arter which would ref lect , on the broad est basis possible and as part of a d y n am ic proces s, the common cons titutional tra ditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law , rather than being a mere statement of the low est common d en om in ator
In my cap ac ity as a represent ative of the Commission, I will ensure that the ch arter and the actions st em m ing from it represent an aff irm ation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integr al part of Europe ' s common her it age
That is the only way in which we can help to rest ore the leg iti m ac y of the project of an enl ar ged European Union in the e y es of every European citizen , an enl ar ged Europe based on respect for rights and freedom s, with a guarantee of person al safety and safety of proper ty and with effective legal protection , in other words, a Union ro oted in the political values which under p in cont emp or ary democra ci es
I must not over lo ok the fact that 1999 mark ed the begin ning of the 1999 - 2 00 4 parliament ary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission to ok up its d u ties and, as a consequ ence, the year in which a Commissioner so le ly responsible for the areas of justice and home affair s ass um ed his respon sib ili ties
In addition to these event s, I would like to remind Parliament of some item s that were approved in 1999
In the field of immig r ation, b ord ers and asylum , the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on set ting up the Euro d ac d at ab ase , and a proposal for a directive on conditions for ad mit ting third country national s into Member States of the European Union with a view to re un iting fam ili es, as part of a v ig or ous policy of int e gra ting legal res id ents in the ter rit ory of the European Union
We also presented a communication on common proced ures concerning asylum and a recommend ation for a decision author ising the Commission to open negotiations with I ce land and N or way on an agreement design ed to extend the rules appli ed by the Member States of the European Union under the D ub lin Con vention to those two countries
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the H igh Le vel Group on As ylum and M ig r ation, and u l tim ately, in De ce mber , it presented a proposal aim ed at establishing a European refuge e fund
In the field of judicial cooper ation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aim ed at the " c omm un iti s ation " of certain con vention s. These were the con vention on judicial cooperation and the en for ce ment of jud ge ments in civil and comm er cial matters ( B r us sels I ) , the con vention on j ur is dic tion , recogn ition and en for ce ment of jud ge ments in mat ri m on ial matters ( B r us sels II ) , and a third con vention concerning the service of judicial and ext ra j ud ic ial docu ments in civil or comm er cial matters
In 1999 , we also presented a communication on vic ti ms of crime in the European Union, which l ed to discussion s that were given greater im pe t us at T amp ere . This communication call ed for min imum standards for prot ec ting the vic ti ms of crime , in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to comp ens ation, including the cost of justice
We also presented a proposal for a decision on comb ating fraud and for g er y of non- c as h means of pay ment
In the field of European Union legislation on comb ating financial crime , the Commission presented a proposal for an amend ed directive on money l au nder ing
In 1999 , Euro p ol to ok up its d u ties and we in the Commission, e ch o ing the Portuguese Presidency ' s statement today, s in c ere ly hope that as we enter a new e ra in justice and home affair s and discussion s start on the implementation of new po w ers att rib ut ed to Euro p ol under the Treaty of Amsterdam , there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the link s between Euro p ol and the rele vant judicial institution s, and in particular Euro j ust
In 1999 , the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat d ru g s, which under p in s the strategy approved by the H els ink i European Council
This list of action s, which is not ex h a us tive , should , here today, in the pres ence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House , help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of con so lid ation for EU action in this key area , it also - I very much hope - represent ed the start of a new ph ase , mark ed by the des ire to spe ed up the establish ment of an area of freedom, security and justice
For this reason , 2000 will no doubt be a year for t es ting how the EU ' s institutions respon d to our citizens ' demand s for guarant e ed freedom of movement , with respect for their rights and guarant ees of security and st ability though appropriate judicial protection
In other words, 2000 will be a t est of the political will to take Amsterdam serious ly and to help to build the found ations for an enl ar ged political Union for the next dec ade - a t est for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own respon sib ili ties and it is according ly put ting the fin ish ing to uch es to an initi al proposal for a sc ore b o ard so that the institutions and other interest ed par ties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in comp ly ing with the de ad l ines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam , in the V i en n a action plan and in the conclusion s of the T amp ere European Council. This sc ore b o ard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning
It will also , and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the account ability of all the European Union' s institutions towards the public . It is for the public , therefore, that we are develop ing the area of freedom, security and justice
The progress made will not be due to the Commission n or to the Council, n or even to the European Parliament, but to a comb in ation of European institutions and to the Member States themselves , in as much as - as has already been point ed out here - specific tas ks on the sc ore b o ard will be ent r ust ed to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity
In the coming week s, I shall be making a to ur of capital s to s ound out the opinion s of the various min ister s for justice and home affair s
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil soci ety on this sc ore b o ard project
And we hope , during the Portuguese Presidency , to present the final ver sion to the Justice and H ome Affairs Council, taking account of the s ound ings that I have just mentioned
It is my intention that this sc ore b o ard should become an instrument provid ing political and strategic guid ance to all the institution s, and that it should also be an instrument for public sc ru tin y
For this reason , and I believe that this is a challenge we are all fa c ing, I recogn ise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real add ed value which the Union b r ings to d a ily life ac ces sible and vis ible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizens hip , for leg ality and, u l tim ately, for democracy itself
In addition to the sc ore b o ard , I would like to anti cip ate the following initiatives that the Commission intend s to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphas ise that I am de light ed the Portuguese Presidency is t re ating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme
I hope that in con j unction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of inter in s titutional cooper ation, which is also the political m ess age of T amp ere , and that this spirit of inter in s titutional cooperation will be carried forward by sub sequ ent presid en ci es
Reg ard ing immig ration and asylum , the Commission intend s to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the te mp or ary protection of refuge es ; to initi ate an analysis of criteria and conditions for impro ving implementation of the D ub lin Con vention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis , in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam ; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already p ub lish ed concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union ; and to present proposals with a view to prepar ing legislation on the gr an ting of res id ence per mit s to vic ti ms of tra ffic k ing in human being s who cooper ate with judicial action against net wor ks of tra ffic k ers
I also intend to contrib ute to the process of cl ar if ying the role of action plans as part of the work of the H igh Le vel Group on As ylum and M ig r ation, and to make progress in ad ap ting Community agreements in the field of read m ission by including standard cla us es
F urther more, on the subject of cross ing the ex tern al b ord ers of Member States, which is a central issue regarding the free movement of person s, I shall , in the next few day s, be pres en ting a proposal for a regulation up d ating the list of third countries whose national s are required to hold vis as for cross ing the ex tern al b ord ers
Tur ning to judicial cooper ation, in addition to an initiative on the law applic able to non- con t ra ct ual oblig ations, I s in c ere ly hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for min imum standards ens uring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceed ings
I also intend to continue discussion s on the prepar ation of specific common proced ural rules for simp li f ying and spe ed ing up cross-border judicial proceed ings relating to small comm er cial and consum er cla im s, a li m on y cla im s and non- con t est ed cla im s
As a follow - up to the T amp ere and H els ink i conclusion s, the Commission will be pres en ting its contribution to the prepar ation of a European Union strategy to combat organ ised crime
We will be organ ising and supp or ting actions includ ing, in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing m ut ual recogn ition of judicial decisions in criminal matters
The Commission also intend s to present specific measures in the field of crime pre vention , so as to encoura ge exch ang es of best practice in this area , and in particular the pre vention of urban and j u ven ile de lin qu ency ; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme finan ced by the Community for this purp ose
The Commission will also support the presid ency ' s efforts to cl ar if y the judicial framework and the framework for polic e and judicial administ ra tive cooperation in the fight against money l au nder ing, an e min ently cross - p ill ar issue
The Commission will fulf il the re mit given to it at T amp ere to present proposals for appro ving defin ition s, criminal ch ar g es and common s an ctions in the field of tra ffic k ing in human being s, economic exp lo it ation of immig r ant s, and se x ual exp lo it ation of w om an and ch ild r en, with special emphas is on comb ating the use of new means of communic ation, not ably the Intern et , for dist rib u ting ch ild p or n o graph y
We are also prepar ing a communication to ins tig ate a debate on means of ens uring greater security in the information and know ledge soci ety and in comb ating comp ut er crime
The year 2000 also mark s the start of the implementation of the European Union D ru g s St r ateg y 2000 - 2 00 4
In this field the Commission, in con j unction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Inter in s titutional Conference to be held on d ru g s in F e b ru ary
With regard to Sch eng en, without wish ing to t res p ass on the ter rit ory of the Council, or more precisely the incorpor ation of the Sch eng en ac qu is into the Community framework , I would like to st res s, on the top ical subject of rest or ing border control s, that the Commission wishes to re iter ate its will ing ness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Sch eng en Con vention in order to re in for ce its authority
The recent rest or ing of certain internal border control s lead s me to believe that we need a detail ed analysis of the conditions for adop ting a legislative instrument based on Article 6 2 of the Treaty
As was emphas ised at T amp ere , and as part of our prepar ations for the F e i ra European Council in J un e 2000 , we will have to prep are a su m m ary of the imp lic ations of the new ex tern al di men sion of justice and home affair s with a view to adop ting cross - p ill ar policy strateg ies, which strengthen the link s between the Union' s internal and ex tern al policies in this field and help to up ho ld the Union' s position on the world stage
N ever thel ess, I must make it clear that all these actions will , of course, have to take into account the principles ag reed at the H els ink i European Council concerning applic ant countries, so that those applic ants can cooper ate and also be as soci ated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice
F urther more, it is important to re me mber that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affair s negotiations with the first group of applic ant countries and I anti cip ate that we will be in a position to make substan ti al progress in prepar ing the negoti ating do s si ers on the second group with which it was ag reed to open ac ces sion negotiations at H els ink i
L ast ly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intend s to be in the po le position in pres en ting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their res pe ctive r ol es in ex erc ising their right to initiatives and in carry ing forward the legislative process itself
As I have to ld Parliament, the task before us is im men se and amb iti ou s, and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respon d to this challenge
We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and - why not say it - of the Council to sec ure these resources and to achieve these objectives , so that the establish ment of an area of freedom, security and justice bec om es a reality as soon as possible , th us allow ing us all to contrib ute , in a spirit of inter in s titutional cooper ation, to the real isation of this project , which is, without a doubt , the " j e w el in the c ro wn " of the Treaty of Amsterdam
Mr President, having dev oted itself over the last 4 0 years to establishing a common internal market , the House now fa ces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice , a task which we will only be able to m ast er successful ly if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this amb iti ous go al with m ut ual respect and consideration for each other ' s compe t ence
Commissioner V itor in o, although I would des c rib e cooperation with you as harmon ious and pro fit able , words have often fail ed me in the past when fa ced with the con du ct which the Council has demonstr ated towards us
It look ed, as Mr Sch ul z once ap t ly said in committee , as if the Council under st o od the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free re in , security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will
Minister G om es, I have , of course, he ard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency
I should like to ra ise three points which for us, as Members of the P P E Group , must be foc al points when such an area is creat ed
First : a common asylum law must be creat ed and the b ur den of abs or b ing refuge es must be dist rib ut ed
The Council must start by at long last ens uring that EUR O D A C is adopted in order to create the basic require ment for cl as si f ying asylum seek ers
As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at V i en n a and T amp ere
Un fortun ately, however, it has high light ed the difficulties rather than propos ing solution s
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look be y ond their national b ound ar ies and bring about a un if orm asylum procedure for the whole Union
S im ilar ly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States will ing to provide help to bear the entire b ur den of refuge e mis er y on our contin ent
Ag ree ment on b ur den sh ar ing must therefore be at the top of the agenda
Second ly : the introdu ction of a Europe - w ide fight against organ ised crime , including by Euro p ol and Euro j ust
The plan n ed introdu ction of Euro j ust is one of our significant success es from T amp ere and must now be implemented forth w ith
We welcome the fact that Euro p ol has fin ally been able to start work
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effec tiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to w id en Euro p ol ' s re mit , as decid ed at T amp ere ; we also need to increase the number of offic ers and extend its re mit to oper ational activities
We are not just call ing for more control , and more control over Euro p ol ; our m ot t o here is " L ess is some tim es more ! "
With most of Euro p ol employ ees currently en g aged in s el f- con t rol for the purp os es of d at a protection law s and questions being asked by 15 national parliament s, we may have a great deal of control , but it is in e fficient control
We want less conf us ing control and more parliament ary control by the European Parliament, without ha mp er ing the work of Euro p ol
At the same time, we support the establish ment of a European polic e ac ad em y as suggest ed in T amp ere as a step in the right dire ction
Th ird ly : the ext ension to Parliament' s rights in this context
If the establish ment of such an area , in which the Union can also inter ven e in the basic rights of the citizen s, is only decid ed by di p l om at s and bureauc rat s, while the elect ed representatives of Europe are redu ced to following develop ments like a r ab b it w at ch ing a s n ake , then this area will not g ain the accept ance of the citizens
There is therefore an urg ent need to grant Parliament cod ec ision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control
We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them
Mr President, I have nothing further to say to the Council
The previous speak er has qu oted me from the last committee meeting and said it all !
Wh y does the Council find it so hard to work with us in creating an area of freedom, security and justice ?
I find this question more and more wor ry ing
A llow me to tr y and e lu cid ate it a little from my point of view
The establish ment of an area of freedom, security and justice ho vers at the inter f ace between the constit u ent ele ments of national so ver e ign ty
The polic e and judicial policy are quite clearly ele ments of so ver e ign t y, in other words sen si tive political areas in the Member States, and sh if ting the inter f ace of these and commun iti s ing these polic ies, i.e. de leg ating po w ers from the national capital s, from L is b on , B er lin or Par is , to Brus sels represent s a trans fer of power
Of course it is very , very difficult to b re ak away from the ex ec u tive for ms which have been hand ed down to us, even if we recogn ise that polic e cooperation is necessary ; we can only fight international crime at European level
So we have to draw our conclusion s and say that we need legal and organ is ational commun iti s ation of the instru ments available
As a result , the governments which need to do this and which recogn ise that need , also real ise that, in implementing this, they are taking away their own po w ers
Th en there is the European Parliament, which is also comp lic ated
In the final analysis , however, we must find a way forward , because if we carry on as we have in the past , and with last year ' s experience , then what will happen is that the security debate and the debate about citizens ' rights will be mar gin al ised in the national parliament s as a result of making it a h alf national , h alf European structure
It has not quite taken off in the European Parliament and the Council meet s behind cl osed do ors
If the establish ment of an area of freedom, security and justice is k ep t sec ret , then we shall not w in the citizens over to it
In other words, the st ability of democracy is at st ake if we discuss it
This is why I f re qu ently get so work ed up , but not over the Council of Minister s
G ener ally, they too are elect ed Members of Parliament : Mr G om es, Mr C ost a, Commissioner V itor in o, in principle we are all in the same bo at
However, I should like to make an appe al to the Council app ar at ch i ks
The following principle appli es : He who prep a res decision s, in this case the Council app ar at ch i k s, anti cip ates the decision s, which is why the Council app ar at ch i ks should demonstr ate more democratic spirit
I should just like to mention another aspect brief ly because I do not have much time
S c ore b o ard s ound s like s k ate b o ard in German
I say therefore that we need a tim et able which sti pul ates what must be implement ed, when and by wh om
This V itor in o plan is what we need : clear , precise projects with a clear , def ined tim et able
Mr V itor in o, wh om I would like to thank for his speech , can give us that, provided that he has the necessary financial and human resources
Let us give him those resour ces, then he can get on with his job and we all stand to g ain
I w arm ly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affair s one of its top prior ities or j e w els in the c ro wn
I was also encoura ged by Commissioner P at ten ' s comments this mor ning about a r ap id re action fund for security cris es
P er haps that will end sc and als like the fail ure of states to dep loy in Kosovo the polic e they prom ised
I just want to high light three areas among many where we need quick progress
The first is asylum
It is essential to establish a single European system , but one based on fa ir n ess, full respect for the G ene v a Con vention and dec ent re cep tion condition s, including an end to r ou tin e det ention
D ec ision s on asylum should take months - not years
The second area is that of freedom : freedom to move and res ide where ver one wishes in the Union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have European citizens hip - and that includ es not just Member State citizens but third country national s
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affair s are about freedom, not just about rep ression
The last area I want to mention is con ver g ence of civil and criminal justice system s
Euro s cep tic s cla im that this is a threat to so ver e ign t y, the end of the n ation - st ate, and so on
But the case of the su s pect want ed for question ing in connection with the m ur d ers of three women in Fr ance, including B ri tis h stud ent, Is ab el Pe ake , who was th ro wn off a tra in , show s why we need m ut ual recogn ition
Ar re st ed and rele ased in Mad ri d , he is now being ext ra d ited after ar re st in L is b on
Wh ate ver the Euro s cep tic s say, it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters
Finally, as has already been said, it is essential , and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to cod ec ision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial sc ru tin y
Mr President, all I can say about 1999 is this : how w on der ful to feel the Portuguese su m m er after the Fin n ish w in ter
I hope that it work s out
The T amp ere S um mit was certainly an important m il est one in 1999 for Europe, and for the area of freedom, security and justice in particular
N um erous questions are still out stand ing
An s w ers are still aw a ited
S ince T amp ere , there has been an im bal ance between positive action and mere dec l ar ations of int ent
Reg ul ations on national ity and the integration of people from third countries are still out stand ing
On the other hand, quite specific action has been call ed for on the subject of safety of life
The cre ation of a Ch arter of Fund amental Right s will be one of the important projects in the immedi ate future
However, it is difficult to pre d ict what the cont ent of this ch arter will be and how it will be implemented leg ally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union
The Euro p ol agreement has now offic i ally enter ed into force
In T amp ere , the question of gr an ting oper ational po w ers was discuss ed
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorpor ate better parliament ary and judicial control
The agreement also att ra ct s critic ism with regard to EUR O D A C
Parliament has amend ed the contra ct ual text
C are must be taken to ensure that the Council comp lies with Parliament' s mod us oper and i
Un fortun ately, no initiatives have yet materi al ised regarding other matters and we still aw a it them
Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sect ors
And yet we o w e this to the citizens of Europe
Ha ving list en ed to the justice and home affair s min ister s, I am op tim istic and I am ass um ing that we will suc ceed in the next six months
Mr President, Commissioner, the or al question tabled by Mrs T er r ó n i C us í show s that this House is taking a firm st ance . Inde ed, six months after the ele ction of this new Parliament, we should now be able to s end a firm political m ess age to the people of Europe
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contrib ute positive ly to this
We are all aware of the en orm ous expect ations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice , particularly social justice
Y et their lack of interest and involve ment and some tim es even their dist ast e for all things political requ i res us to take specific action to t ack le their problems
This is the s ine qu a non condition for recon cil ing the po p ular and political sp her es
For Europe to become the sy mb ol of peace and f rat ern ity , we need a bo ld and gener ous policy to come to the aid of the most dis ad vant aged
A proper plan for f igh ting unemployment must be established for this is the sc our ge which is allow ing the r ise of r ac ism, xenophob i a, national ism and extre me - ri ght r ac ist move ments
We should re me mber that the most dis ad vant aged include immig r ants and refuge es
The v ir t ually system atic conditions of det ention and the criminal isation of asylum - se e k ers are no longer accept able
All asylum - se e k ers must be en tit led to a fa ir hear ing and an appe al with su sp ens ory effect
L ast week , and some wh at by ch ance, I w it ness ed, at R o is s y a ir port , a sc ene of r are vi ol ence in which two y oun g women , ad mitted ly i l leg al immig r ant s, were being ret urn ed to Con ak ry
They were treat ed like the wor st criminal s
They were st ri pp ed n ak ed and dra gg ed al ong the f lo or by their ha ir , sur round ed by a h ord e of state security polic e
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of b ar b ar ic beh av i our
Our role should be to acc om p an y, reas s ure and assist those who are fle e ing d ict at ors hip s
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refuge es to which Parliament was fa v oura b ly disp osed
In st ead of all this w a ff ling about the budget grant ed to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up
The Presidency and the Council can real ise what was inc om p reh en sib ly reject ed in T amp ere , even though this su m mit provided an important basis
Li ke wise , we cannot simply rec ord the r ise in xenophob ic feel ings in Europe and the increasing ly common discri mination without taking w ide - r ang ing action
The law s against r ac ism must be harmon ised
What dire ction do you intend to give to Article 1 3 of the E C Treaty ?
What do you intend to do to promote equal treat ment in w ag es for m en and women ?
How do you aim to e ra dic ate h om ophob i a, r ac ism and se x ism ?
We must take the best from each of our countries
When six European countries have grant ed the right to vote , the President of this House can v ent ure to extend this right to vote , and elig ibility to particip ate in the m un ic ip al and European ele ction s, to all people from outside the Community who have li ved in Europe for more than five years
The reg ular isation of i l leg al immig r ants in certain countries, including your own , must act as an example to other s. These i l leg al immig r ants now ad ay s constit ute a ple th or a of v ul ner able people at the m er cy of s l um l and l ord s, an opp ress ed work for ce subject to economic exp lo it ation, r ender ing them modern - day s la ves
In more general term s, this Presidency must start to change the beh av i our and inter action of our people with min ority groups and immig r ants
I m m ig ration is too often a sy n on y m for in sec urity and vi ol ence and p ure ly rep res sive respon s es
How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like al way s, immig ration is a sour ce of social and cultural we alth with a role which is, and will remain , essential in the context of population ?
What action do you intend to take to en h ance the place of immig r ants in our soci ety and to guarantee proper protection for asylum - se e k ers ?
Mr President, there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice
The European Union is an economic power h ouse but we are not in a position to p on ti fic ate when it comes to our treat ment of refuge es
The level of r ac ism in our soci ety is ter ri f ying
Ireland , for gener ations, s ent her s ons and d au gh ter s to pla ces of safety throughout the world , but now when the C el tic t ig er is provid ing we alth and pro s per ity be y ond our expect ations, we are show ing a very u g ly s ide to our ch ar ac ter
R ac ism in Ireland is end em ic
It has been a re lative sh ock to our political lead ers to find we must now take a share of the refuge es that have been coming into the European Union for a long time
We are coming from behind in deal ing with the issue and the government is doing its u t most to c at ch up
There is a will ing ness but fear p erv ad es, and to ass u age this fear we must find political and re lig ious lead ers hip not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union
Mr President, we take note that the ex cu se -m aking , re tic ent Presidency , which, in recent month s, has prevent ed us from hold ing a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today, has come to an end
I tot ally agree with Mr v on B o et ti ch er and Mr Sch ul z ' s rem ark s, and t ru ly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom, security and justice , without having to d er og ate from their own po w ers
N ever thel ess, to avoid the c ust om ary cir cu s, which every six months has us ind is c ri min ately att ack ing the Presidency of the Council, may b e Parliament should find the c oura ge to undert ake inc is ive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will dec ide to increase cod ec ision with immedi ate effect and not w a it for another five years
The two i den tical -s ound ing questions which are under discussion are , of course, under p in n ed by a m ant ra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasing ly trans f orm ed politic s into a type of ide olog y - fin e -s ound ing, but p ern ic ious
And our current EU m ant ra is A F S J : A rea for F reedom , Sec urity and Justice
B eh ind this li es another amb ition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the over wh el m ing majority of this House , namely to introdu ce such an area
And who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introdu ce by means of legislative dec re es and other sup r an ational resolution s
F reedom , security and justice are the ro ot system of any soci et y, ref le c ting its hist or y, cor por ate experience and political development
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introdu ce without soci ety ' s sustain ing damage as a result
But it is precisely here that we find the real r ational e behind the m ant ra concerning security , freedom and justice
The agenda is not design ed to sec ure justice for the citizen
That is already sec ure d by means of the various national legal system s
The agenda is design ed to trans fer v ital part s of soci ety ' s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU ' s control
It is concerned with increased integration which, as part of a d up lic it ous p ack age , invol ves increased rep ression and control
You just have to think of all the resolution s concerning F ort Euro p a, Sch eng en, Euro d ac e t c . An y dem ocrat can sp ot two key problems
First of all, the initiatives which have been plan n ed are completely un re al istic
How is it env is aged that the EU ' s institution s, which are already st ret ch ed well be y ond their cap ac ity , can bring the amb iti ous projects concerned to f ru ition ?
Th ink of last year ' s de ad ly critic ism of the Commission' s lack of prop ri et y, e th ic s and account ability
It also , of course, find s ind ire ct exp ression in the question
But , second ly, the projects will put a st ra in on , indeed will be in j ur ious to , the national democra ci es
As long as the EU rev ol ved a round the internal market , only the bod y was being att ack ed
N ow , it is the s ou l
Mr President, today the people of N ort her n Ireland see a str ange i ron y
We had Commissioner P at ten spe aking in this House in def ence of freedom, security and justice and yet his report before the B ri tis h House of Comm ons this after n o on , which has been accept ed, will do away with the R o y al U l ster Con st ab ul ary and its res er ves and put the people of N ort her n Ireland of both re lig ious sec tions into the hand s of the terr or ists
The I R A terr or ists have not given up any of their we ap on s, n or have the lo y al ist terr or ist s, yet the polic e are being for ced into a position where they will not have the power to res ist the terr or ist community
Let me just look at the f ig ures from the day that the agreement was sign ed
In 1998 , we had 5 5 m ur d ers
In 1999 , we had 7 m ur d ers and that does not include the O m a gh b om b where 2 9 were k ill ed and 3 00 in j ure d
B et ween 1998 and 1999 , lo y al ists ass a ult ed and sh ot 12 3 people , while rep ublic ans ass a ult ed and sh ot 9 3 people
Ch ar g es brought against lo y al ists in 1999 tot all ed 1 9 3 , while those against rep ublic ans tot all ed 9 7
S ince J an u ary 2000 , there have been six sh o oting s by lo y al ists and two by rep ublic an s, lo y al ists have been involved in six serious ass a ult s, one lead ing to another m ur der , while rep ublic ans have en g aged in five serious ass a ult s
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs rem ed ying
Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union
This is a task which all M E P s, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legisl at ure : the cre ation, as has been said alread y, of an area of freedom, security and justice
The T amp ere Council, the m ot or and ar ch it ect of this objective , has proposed certain go al s, but five years, the time sc al e la id down for the implementation of Ch ap ter I V of the Treat y, is too long to w a it for the urg ent solution which some problems require
My first point is that Parliament must not be exc lud ed from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision -m aking process must be guarant e ed, especially with regard to this project which affect s the citizen s, as the Commissioner has explain ed very well
My second point is that we must make r ap id progress in the adop tion of a common asylum system , adop ting common proced ural rules and, above all, put ting an end to the current conf u sion between m ig ration for political reason s and m ig ration for economic reason s
The recent law s on a li ens adopted in my country , S p ain , and in B el g ium , are a remin der that there is an urg ent need for the commun iti s ation of immig ration policy
My third and final point rel ates to the ex tern al activities of the Union in the field of immig ration and asylum
We must not and cannot give the imp ression that the Union exc lu sive ly wishes to def end itself from an av al an ch e of refuge es and economic m ig r ants
We must op t for a policy of cooper ating in the development of our ne igh bour ing countries in the East and the M ed iter r an e an area , but we must do so with r ig our , with economic means and in close co ll ab or ation with public institution s, which must cooper ate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are vi ol ated or who wish to em ig r ate in order to meet their most essential needs
Finally, in relation to the Ch arter of Fund amental Right s, the citizens of Europe need to have a v ision of citizens hip
The Euro , employment , even security , are not enough
They need a ' E uro pe an s ou l ' , as a dis ting u ish ed S p anish prof ess or once said
Mr President, un li ke some of the previous speak ers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese min ister s and Mr V itor in o
This t ri o 's words were like m us ic to our ear s as Mr C ey h un has said
As with all m us ic it needs to be a fin e t un e and proper ly or ch est r ated
M an y of us of here are very op tim istic about the next six months
The t un e that will be play ed will be one that the people of Europe will be list ening to and they will want to hear the right s ort of t un e
As des c rib ed this after n o on it will go a long way towards d ro wn ing out some of the un p le as ant t un es we he ard during the European ele ction and over the last few months
The Amsterdam Treaty and the T amp ere Council bu il t on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union
One area though is extremely important , and this House must be involved in it : namely sc ru tin y
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was out l ined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is sc ru tin is ed, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliament s and the citizens of Europe are aware of every thing involved in it
And we must make certain that the detail s are applic able , appropriate and rele vant to the different countries
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspect s of the resolution s before us this after n o on , one or two of which were refer red to ear li er on
I welcome the movement towards the recogn ition of judicial system s in the various countries and the cooperation on crime
That is an area that European citizens will respon d to and will be happ y about
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have res erv ations about the Euro d ac system , for example
We accept the pre d om in ant role of the Council in this, but there are res erv ations and I am sure that the Council will list en to the words coming from the elect ed parliament ar i ans here when they go through it in more detail
Mr Sch ul z said ear li er on that he was not certain about the defin ition of ' s c ore b o ard '
An y one who is En g lish or B ri tis h or follow s c ric k et know s what a sc ore b o ard is
A sc ore b o ard tell s people the sc ore ; it has to be up - t o - d ate and it has to be clear and vis ible
I am sure that Commissioner V itor in o will make certain that is so
At the end of six months I hope that the m us ic is still play ing and that the European people are still list ening
Mr President, I would like to welcome the President -in - O ffice and his colleag ue from the Justice Min ist ry , Mr C ost a, and to thank them for the welcome they g ave my committee in L is b on last week and the con stru ctive meeting s we en j o y ed
Amsterdam and T amp ere have given us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs T er r ó n today show s
I would like to make three brief points
The first is that we need a mat ure dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament
It is b are ly six months since Amsterdam imp osed a d ut y on our two organ is ations to work together ; we have been si z ing each other up , we have had a few min or sp at s, but we need to work effective ly together
Let us st op the sh ad ow -b o x ing
Let us d ro p the e la b or ate ch ar ad es and let us respect the d u ties that the Trea ties imp ose on us and the tim es c al es allow ed for full democratic debate
In v ol ve us ple ase in your discussion s on both policy and process
Let us not pre t end that national parliament s are able to ex erc ise effective democratic control of government activities in this area
My second point is that we need a proper ly resour ced Commission
We have established a new Dire ct or ate - G ener al , yet it has only 7 0 people all to ld
There is an agreement to dou ble this number , but I understand that, so far , not a single new person has ar ri ved
We are set ting the Commission a m as sive task , not least in the draw ing up of the sc ore b o ard
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs
Finally, on the cont ent of the debate , I welcome the fact that the presid ency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda
All good things come in th re es, especially in our policy area
T w o h und red years ag o it was li ber t y, equ ality and f rat ern ity , and things w ent al ong very well until the governments of the left raised equ ality above the others
N ow it is freedom, security and justice , and I hope that the current governments of the left will he ed the words of Commissioner V itor in o and res ist the te mp t ation to ele v ate security , important as it is, above the equ ally important needs of freedom and justice
Al though the main achieve ments in the con struction of an area of freedom, security and justice should be mention ed, we must re me mber that there is still ro om for progress
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and commun iti s ation is inc om p le te
The un il ater al decision by B el g ium to re - est ablish border control s is a clear i ll ust ration of this
The decision to establish a Ch arter of Fund amental Right s is to be wel com ed but it is difficult to pre d ict whether its cont ent and legal scope will be restric tive or sy mb olic , including all people , wh ate ver their national ity , or exc lud ing some
The total lack of progress in European citizens hip and the political rights of all European res id ents is to be regret ted
Al though action plans established by the high - le vel working group aim to limit m ig rat ory f low s in the future , these plans do nothing to improve human right s, civil li ber ties and the economic situation in the countries concerned
We know that read m ission cla us es are included in the cooperation and as soci ation agreement s. Y et these represent a serious threat to the principle of ' n on - re f ou lement ' [ n o t ur ning back ]
F urther more, it should be not ed that these provision s were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without cons ul ting Parliament
However, the main concern remain s
( T he President c ut the speak er off )
Mr President, I would like to j o in my colleagues in wel coming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner
I thank them for their state ments to the House
R ather than go back over the areas that have already been cover ed I would like to deal with one specific top ic : the question of d ru g s and how we t ack le the p erv a si ven ess of the d ru g culture in our soci e ties
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the t re m end ous work which was done by the Fin n ish Presidency in bring ing forward coordin ated plans and action between the Member States
We already have , on the international s ide , plans in place to combat d ru g tra ffic k ing, money l au nder ing and so on
But to bring it down to a more human level : to give assistance to those people who are tr ying to come off d ru g s, and give them proper control s and proper m ech an is ms for re h ab il it ation ; second ly, to coordin ate among st the polic e for ces and the judic i ary with regard to common p en al ties and common law s ; third ly, to undert ake an information and aw ar en ess c amp a ign for y oun g people ; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of " n orm al isation " and " h arm redu ction " and show that any weak ening of our resol ve in making sure that d ru g s are not legal ised must be for the good of all our people
Mr President, I would like to use the few second s of spe aking time to which I am en tit led to point out , or remind , the represent ative of the Commission that, in B el g ium , the government is currently purs u ing a policy under which th ous and s and pos sib ly t ens of th ous and s of i l leg al a li ens are being legal ised and are to rece ive per man ent right of res id ence, right to be re un ited with their fam ili es, e t c
This is a B el g ian government measure which f lies in the face of the Sch eng en Treaty
I l od ged a wr itt en comp l ain t on the same subject to Commissioner V itor in o on 2 3 De ce mber
I would ask him to take this comp l ain t into consideration and inform me , within the fore se e able future , of the step s the Commission will take to p en al ise this vi ol ation of the Sch eng en Treaty by the B el g ian State , in accordance with Article 2 2 6 of the Treaty
Mr President, est e em ed gentlemen from Portug al , especially the Council representatives , you face great expect ations on our part
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expect ations re lative ly quickly in at least one small s eg ment
I refer to Euro d ac
You will re me mber that we decid ed with great expect ations here in the European Parliament in De ce mber that Euro d ac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system , as a Community instrument which we urg ently need in order to prevent mul ti p le asylum applic ations, in order to have an instrument to fight i l leg ality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure
We voted clearly in favour of the introdu ction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be att ach ed to the Commission in just the same way that a cor res pon d ing d at ab ase would be
We were of the opinion that EUR O D A C was bec om ing a reality
E ven in T amp ere , we were of the opinion that Euro d ac was bec om ing a reality
However, the Council then to ok another dire ction at the very next su m mit in De ce mber and to ok a h uge step back wards by decid ing what we had absolutely reject ed, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implement ation, that the regul atory committee would be att ach ed to the Council and that, where possible , G ib r al t ar would still be used to ex er t press ure
This is a perf ect example of the s ort of work we do not want to see
My urg ent request on behalf of the Group is that you do every thing to ensure that Euro d ac is implemented immedi ately as an instrument to fight asylum ab use and i l leg ality and as an instrument to spe ed up asylum proced ures
If you tell us today how you wish to pro ce ed, you will be doing us a great service
Mr President, Minister s, Commissioner, the 1999 h ar ves t of decisions was indeed r ich , so much so that it bec a me difficult to g ather , i.e. to put those decisions into practice
I refer in particular to the Council and to the in er ti a of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had joint ly made
However, the past year was positive ly mark ed by some moment ous decision s, such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam , the decision to incorpor ate the Sch eng en Ag ree ment into the Community p ill ar , and the decision of the C olog ne Council to create a Ch arter of Fund amental Right s and the decision of the E xt ra ordin ary European Council in T amp ere to b ind the Member States to common dire ction s, prior ities and go als with a view to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice
With out wish ing to i gn ore the progress which has been made , we , the European Parliament, would like to draw your attention to the un w ill ing ness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas, as well as its lack of common v ision and, in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament
F rom what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of obs er ver
N e ither will it st op ra ising v ital issues . For example, how much progress are you will ing to make and what measure s, legislative or other wise , will you be taking to combat the sc our ge of tra ffic k ing in human being s, ch ild p or n o graph y on the Intern et , d ru g s, and organ ised crime ?
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immig ration ?
How do you intend to go about int e gra ting immig r ants into the Community , re un iting them with their fam ili es and recogn ising their rights and d u ties on an equal fo oting with those of the citizens of Europe ?
In light of this new international dem o graph ic cl ass p ort ra y ed by exper ts at the U N , is it not about time you ab and on ed your tra dition al , cons erv ative views on refuge es and immig r ants ?
I have great expect ations for the Portuguese Presidency
Mr President, I welcome much , indeed most , of what has been said in this debate
But I want to add a word of ca ution
We risk having not too few ch arter s of rights in this Community , but too many : national , European Union and European Con vention ; not too few t rib un als having the final say about our rights but pos sib ly too many - there is the Court ac ross the r i ver there , there is the Court in L u x em bour g
There are also cour ts in K ar l s ru he , L ond on , L is b on , D ub lin and E d in b ur gh
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense
We must not gener ate a conf u sion and conf lic t of j ur is dic tions about right s, for that would be the en em y of freedom, justice and security
We need , in short , to have and to sustain the high est possible common standards and to find way s of sec uring these
But we must look always to subsidiarity
Li ke every b od y in this House , I want freedom, justice and security
I do not want to see these de g ener ate into over -c entral is ation, ch a os and conf u sion
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to make one point
V ar ious Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disp os al , and my colleag ue , the Minister for Justice , and I therefore propose to rep ly objective ly to all the questions put here at the parliament ary committee meeting which we shall be att ending next week
( S ustain ed app la use )
Thank you, Minister
The debate is cl osed
Mr President, I am gr ate ful for the Council ' s or al , and also wr itt en, rep ly
The ir efficiency has been t ru ly rem ark able
I will sa ve a few second s because I want ed to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on C itiz ens ' Right s and F reedom s, Justice and H ome Affair s. Th en we will have the opportunity to comment on these rep lies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well
P ers on ally, I am pleased with some of the rep li es, for example, in relation to issues as sen si tive as Sch eng en and the Euro p ol Con vention , which we hope will be review ed, and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to tr ying to bring them under the j ur is dic tion of the judicial authorities
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliament ary control
Rep resent atives of the Council, within the next month we are going to t able a motion for a resolution in this Parliament
I am sure that, with the will ing ness that you have sh own today, the first thing you will do , in this new c li m ate of understand ing between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will sub mit to you
Question T ime ( C ouncil )
The next item is Question T ime ( B 5- 000 3 /2 000 )
We will exam ine questions to the Council
Question No 1 by ( H - 0 7 8 0 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : Con struction of nuclear pl ant in ear th qu ake - pr one Turke y The two recent ear th qu akes in Turke y reg ister ing more than 7 on the R ich ter sc al e ra ise t re m end ous doub ts about Turke y 's pers ist ence with the con struction of cost ly nuclear re act ors at A k k u y u , while energy res er ves produ ced by the At at ü r k dam s are exp ort ed to third countries and the EU sp end s a s lic e of its budget on rep air ing the damage w rought by the ear th qu akes
Turke y 's nuclear plans B which i gn ore the ris ks to the population and ec os y stem s of Turke y and the sur round ing region B pro mp t the su sp ic ion that there are under ly ing plans previous ly deter min ed by Turke y 's political and m il it ary lead ers to ac qu ire nuclear techn olog y en abl ing them to build nuclear we ap on s, as e vid en ced by their attemp ts to bu y re act ors of C an ad ian o ri gin of the type ac qu ire d by Ind ia and P ak ist an
What step s will the Council take to prevent nuclear ac cid ents and the pro li fer ation of nuclear we ap ons in a country that wishes to j o in the EU but sp end s en orm ous amount s on nuclear programmes while recei ving financial aid from the EU budget ?
Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turke y is a sign atory to the Con vention on N uclear S a f et y, the objectives of which should all ay the fear s expressed by Mr S ou l ad ak is
The aim of this con vention , which ca me into force on 2 4 O ct o ber 199 6 , is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooper ation. It further aim s to ensure that nuclear inst all ations are equ i pp ed with continu ing protection against potential r ad i ological risk s, so as to prot ect individual s, soci ety at large and the environment against the harm ful effects of the i on ising r ad i ation that can be em itted by such inst all ations
The con vention , as you will be aware , also co vers the pre vention of ac cid ents which have r ad i ological effects and the limit ation of such effects when in cid ents of this kind occ ur
I would also like to remind Members that, as a c and id ate for members hip of the European Union, Turke y will - and this is a pre - ac ces sion condition , which is an important point - soon er or l at er, as part of its own pre - ac ces sion strateg y, have to adopt a set of policies g e ared towards adop ting the entire ac qu is commun a ut a ire in good time, and including therefore all provision s already in force on nuclear safety
Thank you for your answer
However, I would just like to add the follow ing. Turke y is only look ing to increase its energy potential by 2 % with this un it
N ever thel ess, r um our has it that it plans to bu y C and u re act ors of the type ac qu ire d by P ak ist an and Ind ia which were used for nuclear we ap ons
In this respect , the issue requ i res clos er exam in ation, because the sen si tive situation in the C au c as us region could he ight en people ' s su sp ic ion s
My second point concerns the safety of these pl ant s. In areas of high se ism ic risk , it is not enough just to have sec ure , ear th qu ake - p ro o f build ings
S pe aking as an en g ine er, I can tell you that we carry out t est s to inves tig ate the effects of certain risk fact ors in extre me circ um stan ces
However, we cannot carry out t est s on nuclear pl ants which are in oper ation ; it is just not possible
With this in mind , it goes without saying that nuclear pl ants a prior i should not be bu il t in areas pr one to ear th qu akes
In this respect , and because Turke y is situ ated on the peri p her y of the European Union, we should be help ing it to become a more sec ure , peace ful and cooper ative country
That is our role and this is the point of my question
I recogn ise the rele v ance of the argu ments that Mr S ou l ad ak is has put forward
This is, of course, a high ly sen si tive issue
F urther more, it will be e vid ent that this is a matter that does not only affect Turke y, in view of that country ' s pro x im ity to the existing ter rit ory of the European Union. It also affect s other states ne igh bour ing the EU with which we maintain relations
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them , particularly during the discussion s that we will be having with Turke y to def ine that country ' s own pre - ac ces sion strategy agenda
This question will nat ur ally be one of our key concern s, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account
Thank you, Mr President and thank you President -in - O ffice of the Council
I am sure the President -in - O ffice of the Council is a very n ice man and is very kind to his w if e and his ch ild r en and his do g
However, for g ive me if I am a little s cep tical of the rep ly you have just given me
I do not believe that the state ments made within the Council and the v ot es are available to the public immedi ately
W ill you ple ase therefore undert ake , before the next pl en ary in F e b ru ary , to wr ite and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public , immedi ately the Council has pass ed legisl ation, rather than w a iting for it to come out wee ks l ater on a press rele ase list
W ill you wr ite to me before the next pl en ary with that information ?
Mr N e w t on D un n , I would first like to say that I do not app re ci ate the kind of person al comments with which you st ar ted your second question , and I would be gr ate ful if you could ref ra in from making such comments in future
With regard to what you were say ing, it makes me think that the critic ism le ve ll ed at the Council, ap art from being form ul ated in a very specific way of which we also take not e, does not actually refer to the op ac ity , shall we say, of the legislative proces s, but rather al most to an ex cess of transparency
However, I would like to say, Mr N e w t on D un n , that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be un ques tion able
We have no problem , Mr N e w t on D un n , in repe ating this information to you in w ri ting , but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here , because that meet s the requirements of the Treaty exact ly
We therefore consider that the G ener al Sec ret ar i at of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council ' s f un ctions as a legislative bod y
I do not consider that the Council t ried to answer my question
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled
In st ead , my question concerns the inter p ret ation in principle of Article 2 5 5 of the Treaty of Amsterdam
Do es this per mit legislation also to be pass ed concerning national law s on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union refer red to there ?
I should like to have an answer to that question
Do es the Council consider that, on the basis of Article 2 5 5 of the Treat y, national legislation on transparency can be regul at ed, that is to say legislation not relating to the EU ' s institutions ?
Mr S j ö st ed t , the answer that I g ave was the only answer possible
N ever thel ess, I would like to say that any inter p ret ation of Article 2 5 5 of the Treaty must also be link ed to the principle of subsidiarity
At the mom ent, there are no conc re te proposals which would allow us to make ad j ust ments under this Article , and un less there is such a proposal , we cannot move forward on this matter
In any event , Article 2 5 5 does not, at first s ight , allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity
I am , up to a point , concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contain ed in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purp ose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to particip ate in the decision -m aking process
How is this to be done when , at the same time, the Commission' s proposal - which has been le ak ed, so the general public is aware of it - say s that employ ees ' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working document s, report s, draft s e t c ?
Do es not the Council ' s represent ative think that this makes it difficult to particip ate in the democratic decision -m aking process ?
Mrs F ra h m , the question that you raised is extremely important and we discuss ed it at great l ength during the last Intergovernmental Conference
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions " out wards " , it also appli es between the institutions
B y this I mean that there are aspect s of the form and procedure of the Community institutions ' work ings which are not ac ces sible to the other institution s, and not only as regards the Commission' s relations hip with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission' s relations hip with the Council
As a matter of fact, at the last con ference , this issue was raised and discuss ed on several occasion s
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the prepar atory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference
The matter is still open
G en u ine transparency of the institutions ' work ings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be stud ied again , particularly in the context of the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference . We have no doub ts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this prepar atory group will have an opportunity to ra ise this issue again
I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function , but I think that there is always ro om for improve ment in this matter
For our part , we are prepared to stud y any proposals made in this area
It is a very important question indeed which J on as S j ö st ed t and others have asked
We have a principle of transparency in S w ed en which strength ens democracy and ens ures that there is a worth wh ile dialogue between citizen s, decision m ak ers and authorities
We are very an x ious indeed that the EU , too , should move in this dire ction , and this is also st ated in the Treaty of Amsterdam
One or two years ag o, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs L ö ö w which is extremely important in this context
The report w arn ed that the forth coming process would lead to restric tions upon the transparency of the Member States
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this w ar ning from Parliament
I want to ask the Council if it understand s this w ar ning , in view of what we have now seen in the working docu ments from the Commission
I list en ed very careful ly to what Mr S e i x as d a C ost a had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference
My concern is, if I have under st o od Mr S e i x as d a C ost a correct ly on the inter es ting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC , whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to t ack le the issue of w id ening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference
A fter all, exam ining the issue of transparency in the way s the institutions oper ate should never be h id den away under any old he ad ing or conf ined to some l ob b y or other - though I know full well the importance of these l ob b ies
It should have its own he ad ing in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference , which would mean w id ening the agenda
Mr D im it ra k op ou lo s, transparency is nat ur ally an issue of concern to the institutions
This Intergovernmental Conference will , at the out se t , concentr ate on impro ving the way the institutions oper ate, particularly taking account of the des ire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic , more transpar ent and more effic ient
All of this must never thel ess be done wh il st res pe c ting a broad framework - that of the over all accept ability of any solution s we may dev ise to achieve these three aim s
It is obvious that transparency will be a per man ent f i xt ure on the European agenda and it will , of course, fe at ure on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference
I can ass ure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the prepar atory group for the con ference
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will sure ly r ally behind this proposal
We will then see , at min ister ial level , how we can follow this up
It should never thel ess be not ed that we have just conclud ed the Treaty of Amsterdam , which was approved last M ay , and that there is a ra ft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in prog res s. The question is whether it is pre m at ure or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency
My feel ing is that, in sp ite of every th ing, this issue will always have to be on the agenda , because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is link ed with the need to make the European institutions account able to the public
As far as we are concerned, they will be
We shall tr y to achieve a cons ens us on this matter
Question No 5 by ( H - 0 7 8 5 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : Pro p os al for a regulation l ay ing down the total ad m is sible c at ch es for specific fish popul ations for the year 2000 , and the case of an ch ov ies in particular The l ates t report s from the Intern ational Council for the E x p l or ation of the S e a indic ate that the current level of an ch ov y st oc ks in I C E S z one V I I I is cri tical
Ha ve the Council of F ish eri es Minister s and the Commission assess ed the imp act of trans fer ring the Portuguese qu ot a for I C E S z on es X I and X and C E C A F z one 3 4 . 1 . 1 to France ( 5 000 m et ric t on n es per year over f ish ing ) on the I C E S z one V I I I an ch ov y st oc ks and their responsibility for the current situation of the an ch ov y st oc ks and the possible social and economic imp act on this fish eri es sector in the future ?
Do es the Council believe that it is per m is sible to con so lid ate future over f ish ing which vi ol ates the o ri gin ally established T A C of 3 3 0 00 m et ric t on n es per year , given the current e vid ence for the cri tical state of an ch ov y st oc ks ?
What measures does the Council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the cri tical state of an ch ov y st ock s, the a fore s a id qu ot a trans fer and the principle of re lative st ability ?
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely an x ious to give a compreh ensive answer to this question , particularly because it bro ach es an issue which concerns Portug al in a positive way , and I shall explain how
The Council is aware of the cri tical level of an ch ov y st oc ks in the B ay of B is c ay to which Mr O r t u ond o L ar rea ref ers
N ever thel ess, at the last F ish eri es Council of 1999 , held on 1 6 and 1 7 De ce mber , the Member States involved in this area of fish ing, namely Fr ance, S p ain and Portug al , considered that apply ing the precautionary principle which set s a T A C redu ced from 5 0 00 t on n es to 2 0 00 t on n es, as the Commission propos ed, was ex ces sive ly c au ti ous
A comprom ise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a bal ance between the need to redu ce the b i ological risk s, that is the speci es of fish being affect ed, and the soci o - ec on om ic problems caus ed by fish ing limit s. This was achie ved by f i x ing the T A C at an inter m edi ate level of 1 6 0 00 t on n es inst ead of the 3 3 0 00 set in 1999
It was also sti pul ated that this would be rev ised in the light of new scientific information on pres er ving speci es, of which we hope to see examp les in the first six months of this year
As for the S ou ther n st oc ks of an ch ov y in I C E S z one I X , the T A C was f i x ed at 1 0 0 00 t on n es for the whole of 2000 as opp osed to 1 3 0 00 t on n es in 1999
F ish ing qu ot a trans f ers between Portug al and France were redu ced prop or tion ally from 5 0 0 8 t on n es in 1999 to 3 0 00 t on n es in 2000 , for fish ing in French w at ers
I would like to state that this trans fer will not increase the press ure of fish ing on an ch ov y st oc ks over all , over the whole Community fish ing area
In accordance with the principle of re lative st ability , 9 0% of st oc ks of an ch ov y in the B ay of B is c ay are alloc ated to S p ain and only 1 0% to France
With out this trans fer from Portuguese water s, the level of the B ay of B is c ay T A C would have to be mul ti p li ed by t en in order to grant ad equ ate c at ch es to France
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portug al ' s point of view
This situation would obvious ly be even more dam ag ing to the level of st oc ks than the risk refer red to by Mr O r t u ond o L ar re a, which we also understand
Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, I must say that your comments have not satis f ied me at all
I understand that Portug al is affect ed by this
However, it seems to go against all reason and int e ll ig ence that 8 0% of the an ch ov ies, which, until 199 5 , were being fish ed in the Portuguese fish ing ground s, through an agreement between that Member State - Portug al - and Fr ance, should now be fish ed in the B ay of B is c ay and that the Council of Minister s wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the an ch ov y st oc ks in the B ay of B is c ay or the C ant ab ri an S e a
It has been sh own , as we have been cla im ing since 199 5 , that this move is app all ing, and, if Portug al and France wish to reach an agreement , that is fin e by us, but these an ch ov ies should be fish ed in Portuguese fish ing ground s and not in the B ay of B is c ay
T od ay , scientific stud ies show that the an ch ov y population in the B ay of B is c ay is in dang er of ex tin ction , and now there will be measures to restric t the amount of an ch ov y which can be fish ed in that B ay
I do not know if you are aware , representatives of the Council of Minister s, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well , for the p light of the fam ili es who live on an ch ov y fish ing in the n orth of the I ber ian P en in s ular
I would like to say, Mr O r t u ond o L ar re a, that in its jud ge ment of 5 O ct o ber 1999 , the European Court of Justice rul ed that this trans fer , which was appro v ed, was in accordance with the principles la id down in Council Reg ul ation 3 7 / 6 0 / 9 2 and, specific ally, with its Article 9 ( 1 ) , which sti pul ates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fish ing rights that they have been alloc ated
The Court also st ated that the principle of re lative st ability had not been vi ol ated since the an ch ov y qu ot a alloc ated to S p ain in z one V I I I had been maintain ed at 9 0% and France ' s at 1 0%
A p art from this, Mr O r t u ond o L ar re a, the Court is of the opinion that the trans fer effect ed between Portug al and France does not vi ol ate the principle of exp lo iting living se a and f res h w ater resources in a r ational and responsible way , on the ground s that the fish ing press ure in z on es V I I I and I X ne ither increas es n or ad ver se ly affect s the over all qu ot a of these resources alloc ated to S p ain
A cc ord ing ly, Mr O r t u ond o L ar re a, the Council re iter ates its opinion that without this trans fer , greater account would be taken of France ' s pos sib ili ties for an ch ov y fish ing in the B ay of B is c ay
The Council therefore re iter ates its opinion that fish ing press ure would be greater and more dam ag ing to population number s than the solution which was event ually ch os en
In conc re te term s, 3 0 00 t on n es represent 5 7 . 5 % of Portug al ' s fish ing opportunities in 2000 against 5 0 0 8 t on n es or 7 3 . 9 % in 1999
These number s represent , in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improve ment in terms of cons erv ation in comp ar is on with the level of 8 0% la id down in Council Reg ul ation 6 8 5 / 9 5
Question No 6 by ( H - 0 7 8 8 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : M e as ures to combat the continu ing e th n ic c le ans ing of S er b s and R om an ies in Kosovo On 2 De ce mber 1999 , N A T O 's D ef ence Minister s made a strong appe al for an end to the e th n ic c le ans ing of Kosovo 's min ority commun ities
In its resolution refer ring to specific at ro ci ties comm itted against S er b s and R om an ies, Parliament also v ig or ous ly con d em n s the continu ing vi ol ence against the S er b population and call s on the lead ers of the Kosovo Al ban i ans to fully respect U N R es olution 12 4 4
The resolution also stress es that previous per sec ution of the Al ban i ans cannot constit ute a pre te xt for k ill ing s, ab du ction s, det ention s, in tim id ation, ar s on , lo oting , d est ru ction of proper ty and the taking - over of h ous es e t c
In the light of the above , will the Council recon sider the funding for the recon struction of Kosovo , as reques ted by Parliament ?
What other practical measures will it take to put a st op to e th n ic c le ans ing ?
Mr A la v an o s, I would like to say that I have the gre ates t sy mp ath y for the concern under ly ing the issue you have raised
We g en u ine ly share your concerns about the threat ening situation which ex ists in Kosovo for e th n ic min or ities, for both the S er b and R om an y popul ations, and the in cid ents of discri min ation, h ar ass ment and in tim id ation which continue to take place in that region
The Council has always stress ed the need to seek pro sec ution of all those who have per pe t r ated such act s and of those who continue to per pe t r ate such act s
The Council once again re iter ated the need , in its De ce mber conclusion s, to fully implement Sec urity Council resolution 12 / 99 and has cons ist ently support ed B ern ard K ou ch ner ' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of min or ities in the region and, in particular , to guarantee that measures fa cil it ating the pres erv ation of the region ' s mul ti - eth n ic make - up are effective ly implemented
In our cont act s with sen i or political f ig ures among st the Kosovo Al ban ian s, we have stress ed - and the Portuguese P ri me Minister did this very rec ently - that per sec ution of the S er b popul ation, the R om an y population and other e th n ic groups is tot ally unacceptable
It will not be to ler at ed, and must st op immedi ately
It has been communic ated exp lic it ly and repe ated ly to Koso v ar lead ers that international support will dep end to a large extent on the way non- A l ban ian min or ities are treat ed
I think that this is an extremely important point : this sense of condition ality , which under lies the European Union' s position , is being maintain ed by the Council and will continue to be maintain ed
We have fully support ed the efforts of the United N ations m ission and the international security for ces in Kosovo to prevent further out b re ak s of vi ol ence against min or ities and to prot ect the popul ations under threat
K F O R and the U N M I C polic e consider one of their two main tas ks to be pre ven ting any form of m al t reat ment on the ground s of a person ' s e th n ic o ri gin
The Council therefore expressed its satis f action , in its De ce mber conclusion s, at the substan ti al contribution s ann oun ced by the European Commission, which will ind ire ct ly assist in ret ur ning the situation to n orm al , together with sim ilar contribution s made by Member States
N ever thel ess, Mr A la v an o s, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organ is ations in Kosovo does not mat ch the des ire d amount , in terms of what the various Member States have been able to ra ise , and this has limited the real ab ility of these organ is ations to act on the ground
We shall never thel ess continue to dev ote all our attention to this problem because the entire cre di bility of the authorities and of the organ is ations rep res en ting Al ban i ans in the region also dep end s on the ab ility of these organ is ations to pro ve themselves cap able of implementing measures which will guarantee the region ' s mul ti - eth n ic nature
I would like to thank Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portug al , its form er presid ent, Mr So are s, and its government , maintain ed a c au ti ous and m id d le -of- th e - ro ad st ance during the b om b ings in the B alk ans
T od ay ' s political statement on this issue was very positive inde ed, and one which I welcome
However, there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and hon est int en tions expressed by the European Union
Un fortun ately, we have rec ently w it ness ed the e ra dic ation of S er b , R om an y, Tur k ish , and C ro a ti an min or ities in Kosovo and we are now w on der ing what will happen next
The United N ation ' s , and Mr K ou ch ner ' s , m ission in Kosovo end ed in fail ure
This fail ure is i ll ust r ated by the fact that after an entire w ar that was w aged to put an end to e th n ic c le ans ing, we now have e th n ic c le ans ing from the opp os ite s ide
And so I would like to repe at my question as to whether the Council intend s to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr K ou ch n er, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today
Mr A la v an o s, I cannot agree with what you just said in your last s ent ence on Mr K ou ch ner ' s respon sib ili ti es, and I would like to make two very important points here . The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the a us p ic es of the United N ations
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contrib ut ed in various way s
There is one th ing, however, that we cannot d en y, and that is that Mr K ou ch ner ' s efforts to ret urn Kosovo ' s internal situation to n orm al have been extremely positive
This is u nd en i able , even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these effort s, for reason s be y ond Mr K ou ch ner ' s control , have not been as effective as we would all have li k ed them to be
I have one last point to make , which is about the European Union' s responsibility and, specific ally, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter , and the responsibility of the international community , which has over all responsibility for the situation in Kosovo
Therefore , the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context
It is the international community , and specifically the United N ations, which should be held responsible for implementing R es olution 12 / 99 and, in particular , for the think ing behind this resolution and for the comp a ti bility of this resolution with reality
These are questions which we should all be ask ing, but the for um for put ting these questions is the United N ations
Mr President, Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, I hear ti ly welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structure s, in the aim of impro ving the cre di bility of the authorities
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public
The question which I therefore ask myself is this : has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the medi a in this area , how we can tra in j our n al ists and how we can improve information to the public on peace ful co e x ist ence ?
We have end e av ou red to provide materi al help
We have t ried to def end peace by taking m il it ary action
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include p s y ch ological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ?
Mr R ü b ig , as I said, I understand your concerns very well
I think that, at the mom ent, particularly in the last few month s, there have been some positive develop ments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr K ou ch n er, in order for him to be able to do his job effici ently
I he ard Mr K ou ch ner speak at the Council of Europe min ister ial meeting on this issue , and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to over come some of the problems have now been address ed. In other words, he has been given these resources
Firstly, an increase in polic e number s would be an important fact or in guarantee ing the safety of the civ ili an population and, in particular , in prot ec ting certain sec tions of the civ ili an popul ation. Secondly, an increase in appropri ations would allow some official s who have important r ol es in the administ ra tive and oper ational process in Kosovo to be k ep t on
The issue which we should all ra ise , and I did so myself , in a di p l om atic way , a while ag o, concerns the very sub st ance of Sec urity Council R es olution 12 / 99
I know that this is an extremely de lic ate issue , but we should all be question ing the l og ic behind this resolution and its ch an ces of being implemented
We adv oc ate that it should be implemented in its entire ty
N ever thel ess, we must look at this resolution , and this is also something that the United N ations Sec urity Council will prob ably have to do soon er or l ater . We will have to do so because , as has happen ed in the past in other context s and in other strategic ally important situ ations ac ross the world , we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of proces s, and a certain kind of l og ic and bal ance - which were in fact the l og ic and the bal ance which l ed to this resolution being approved - should be maintain ed in future
What we have to do , and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr K ou ch ner all the necessary resour ces, and you are right , Mr R ü b ig , we have a d ut y to our citizens to explain to them reg ular ly and open ly whether or not these resources are being proper ly used
We in the Council will be tr ying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency
Mr S e i x as d a C ost a, I tot ally agree with you
The problem is not Mr K ou ch ner but the legal basis on which he is work ing, namely R es olution 12 4 4
Ha ving said this, the EU ' s responsibility , which is both your s and our s, is to tr y and move be y ond the provision al nature of R es olution 12 4 4 and dev ise a future sc en ar i o for the whole region
It is the fail ure to def ine this sc en ar i o which is caus ing or encoura g ing the ex cess es, ac cid ents and ass ass in ations mentioned by Mr A la v an os
Do es the Council intend to ra ise the question of the defin i tive stat us of Kosovo ?
If so , does it intend to do so within a general red ef in ition of the region , avoid ing as far as possible the mul ti p lic ation of m ic ro - S t ates , as has t end ed to happen else wh ere , and re un iting the parti es, in this case Kosovo and Al ban ia ?

Question No 8 by ( H - 0 7 9 6 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : N e w INTERREG In iti ative In point 1 of An ne x 2 to its draft Comm un ic ation on INTERREG en tit led : P rom o tion of urban , rural and co ast al development, the Commission author ises for the r en ov ation and development of hist or ic urban cent res using a joint cross-border strategy
However, h ous ing is specifically exc lud ed
G i ven the fact that there are many h ous es in rural areas which are of hist or ic interest , including small c ot t ag es, and, given the need , for a var i ety of reason s, to maintain rural popul ations and to att ra ct people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assist ed if h ous ing projects were fund ed in the areas cover ed by INTERREG ?
Mr President, the Council and, I think , the Portuguese Presidency in particular , are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr G al la gh er ' s question ra ises and I would like to say that we have always pa id the u t most attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas
I would like to point out that in M ay 1999 we adopted a new system for supp or ting rural development which was the four th Community reference framework for sustainable rural development . This was , as you know , one of the changes made during the Ag enda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agric ult ural issues are deal t with at Community level
Th rough the European Ag ric ult ural G u arant ee and G u id ance Fund , the E A G G F , this Community support framework is design ed to help re ver se the tr end of ab and on ing rural areas, an issue you are quite right to ra ise
On the other hand, the European Regional De velop ment Fund , the E R D F , also contrib utes as part of its role to prom oting social and economic cohesion , by red ress ing the main regional im bal an ces and encoura g ing rural areas to take part in development and con ver sion
In this regard , we should bear in mind that the E R D F also contrib utes to prom oting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas
This comb in ation of instru ments en abl es us to implement a policy of rural development which today, further more, is one of the way s in which the common agric ult ural policy - in one of its di men sion s - and regional policy also , have develop ed and chang ed
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the con cept of mul tif unction ality which is now as soci ated with changes in the common agric ult ural policy, and the E A G G F , of course, has a crucial role to play in this
Question No 9 by ( H - 0 7 9 8 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : F arm ing and the Portuguese Presidency W ill the Council out line the prior ities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agric ult ural policy and indic ate the step s it feel s are necessary to bo ost consum er confidence in the agric ult ural sect ors and product s ad ver se ly affect ed by recent health sc a res ?
Y our question on the common agric ult ural policy is one which we take very serious ly and which should always be considered in this House ' s discussion s, because in the future we are like ly to discuss this issue at great l ength
D uring the Portuguese Presidency , we will be continu ing discussion s on the C A P , by ad ap ting some of the common market organ is ations with a view to develop ing the Union' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guarantee ing an improve ment in farm ers ' inc om es, pay ing particular attention to measures which could have an imp act on small fam ily - r un far ms
On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue , if and when the new W T O r ound begin s within its term of offic e, which is by no means guarant e ed, to ensure that the pres ence of Community produ ction on international market s is strengthen ed. It will also continue to ensure a greater bal ance between exp ort ed Community farm product s and pres er ving the mul tif unction al European agric ulture to which I have just refer red
The Portuguese Presidency also att ach es importance to re in for cing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese F ore ign Minister and President -in - O ffice already refer red to this aspect this mor ning
We think that the role of food saf et y, specifically in terms of every thing link ed to public health , is one of our presid ency ' s essential tas ks
It is therefore one of the prior ities of our programme
We shall be develop ing it in four par al le l sch em es, in the Ag ric ulture Council, the He alth Council, the Con s um er Affairs Council and the Intern al M ark et Council
At the S ant a Mar ia d a F e i ra European Council meeting in J un e, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few day s ag o
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European ag ency is crucial in order to give cre di bility to the single market , to st ab il ise confidence in this market , to b re ak down some of the t ension s between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its deal ings with third countries in areas of food safety
This is what we shall be tr ying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope , at the end of it, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House
I thank the President -in - O ffice for his rep ly
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European mod el which is based on fam ily farm ing, main ly those farm ers involved in be ef and sh eep me at produ ction who are now expect ed to se ll their produ ce at or be low produ ction costs
I would like to ask what new step s the Council can take to saf eg uard their interests in the forth coming world trade talk s, in particular , against the r an ch and fact ory - st y le produ ction of the U S A and N e w Z e al and where econom ies of sc al e make competi tive fam ily farm ing for European farm ers extremely difficult and where , of course, European standards of food safety do not apply
I completely understand your concern s, and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain de g ree of cons ist ency within the European Union itself on this issue
We also have to think of the consequ en ces, especially in terms of finan cing and comp ens ating farm ers
N ever thel ess, as you know , this issue is now in the hand s of the European Commission and it will have to take this further
The Council ' s ab ility to inter ven e in this matter is str ict ly limited
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President -in - O ffice to the Ch am ber
But I do not think he answer ed my question with regard specifically to t ack ling home less ness and h ous ing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be will ing to meet the non- governmental organ is ations active ly involved in this field
I app re ci ate and fully support his point on the need for mul ti p le policies and a mul ti - d is cip lin ary approach and also the need to combat the under ly ing caus es of exc lusion which can lead to home less ness and include the problem of d ru g dep end ency
My specific question concerns the problem of home less ness and whether a new presid ency could take a new initiative to tr y to over come some of the difficulties the President -in - O ffice all ud ed to with regard to support at inter governmental level
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role , even if only in provid ing the con du it for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States
Mr C row le y, with regard to the presid ency ' s scope for supp or ting actions by non- governmental organ isation s, particularly those which attemp t to resol ve the problems fa ced by the home les s, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome , and we are very much open to the possibility of supp or ting them
We have work ed close ly with Portuguese N G O s and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency , which we are comb ining with the w ide r ange of concerns under p in ning our whole programme
We have no specific , conc re te initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are cl osed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by N G O s in this area might be considered during our presid ency
It should be point ed out that this can only be done within the Council ' s scope for action
An y aspect of this which may imp ing e on the Commission' s right of initiative will obvious ly have to be done through the Commission itself
Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, you have talk ed a lot about the future , about what the Commission will do , and what the Presidency will do in L is b on , e t c . However, you also said something which I find particularly f ri ght ening
You said that in L is b on you intend to discuss more d y n am ic and competi tive development
I am begin ning to feel a little wor ried because this may lead , parti ally at least , to exc lusion
I do not see how you could , with the views that you hold , provide any ans w ers
What I asked and what I am once again ask ing is the following : what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on , for example, the appe als made by the net work to combat po ver ty and exc lusion , the di vision of work and social security , the implementation of tax polic ies, particularly for specul ative capital , and the policy of red ist rib u ting we alth ?
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intend s to do something about these matters
You must understand that a presid ency ' s ab ility to re ver se global social or economic tr end s during its six months in offic e is actually quite limited
I think that it is also obvious that our ab ility to act is link ed to the Commission' s own scope for inter ven ing, through its right of initiative
I have sp ok en about the S pe cial European Council and about Portug al ' s initiative in con ven ing it, and I have sp ok en about the future , because there are two comp lement ary way s of see ing the issue of social exc lusion . One of them is the seri es of measures which must be adopted immedi ately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exc lusion
The second is to create intern ation ally competi tive condition s, which will en able us to improve the economic fa b ric of the European Union, and this will have positive k n ock - on effects on the problems of social exc lusion
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a m ag ic w and with which it can , in six month s, resol ve problems that have always exist ed
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community compe t ence . It also has the opportunity and the des ire to promote the whole ra ft of measures which may be present ed, specifically by non- governmental organ isation s, but also through the inter governmental co ll ab or ation which is tra dition al in these matters
We should , however, also bear in mind , Mr P ap ay ann ak is , that we cannot act in an area which will have such a b ig financial imp act , ar m ed only with the measures a presid ency can propose in the sp ace of six months
We therefore think that all the measures we have high light ed in terms of long -term strateg ies, regard less of the fact that we know that in the long term , some of the home less may be de ad , will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union
We will tr y to move these strateg ies forward as much as possible during our presid ency
Question No 12 by ( H - 0 8 01 / 99 ) :
S ub ject : Portuguese Presidency and development policy W ill the President -in - O ffice of the Council make a statement on the prior ities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Con vention of L om é and t ack ling fa min e situ ations ?
I would like to thank the presid ency for the compreh ensive answer to my question , and indeed the Minister who sp o ke to the Committee on De velop ment last week in Brus sels out l ining the position
But there are some questions still out stand ing
There does not seem to be any emphas is on the fight against A I D S in the programme
The situation of A I D S in A f ric a now is so serious that more people are d ying of A I D S than are d ying in conf lic t
I hope that the Minister will take some time to purs ue that particular issue
M ed ic ines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them ch e ap enough for the people in A f ric a
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is develop ing in E th i op ia where there is d rought , where the c ro p s have fail ed, and where , in six months ' time, we will in e v it ably be back to the situation as it was some years ag o in E th i op ia with fa min e and people d ying in their th ous and s
At the same time, there is a w ar going on between E rit rea and E th i op ia and the ar m ament s industry in Europe is not short in s ending g un s, after which we will s end the b read
First of all, Mr And re w s, you must understand that I do not agree with your inter p ret ation of my colleag ue ' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on De velop ment
There is no contra dic tion between our two position s, quite the opp os ite
Un less we wish to act like me g al om an i ac s, we cannot in the course of one presid ency perf orm an ex h a us tive inv ent ory of all possible and im ag in ary situ ations relating to all the en orm ous issues we face , particularly in the area of ex tern al relations
As you can understand , it would be e as y to do so
All we would have to do is get a direct ory of development and put all the item s in our programme, one after the other
We are su ffic i ently responsible to real ise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments ' ab ility to act and within the scope of the Council
We must understand that there are limit ations on what we can achieve , particularly in terms of man ag ing national indic ative programmes
You have mentioned E th i op i a, which fall s within the scope of national indic ative programm es, but there are , as you know , several Community actions to combat A I D S , and in this respect , you are right , and the United States will prob ably not do any better
Inde ed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to wor ry about for the simp le reason that our beh av i our in this area comp a res very fa v oura b ly with that of the United States
Y our question s w it ch ed to the subject of ar m s, a broad er policy issue which I do not think fall s within the scope of this question but which the Council will , of course, address in the future , if it se es f it and if it decid es to put it in a specific context
Is the Council aware of the social problems caus ed by the exp ort of food by the EU to develop ing countries at pr ic es be low the cost of produ ction ?
Do es the presid ency intend to do any thing about this ?
S ince the author is not present , Question No 1 3 l aps es
I would like to thank the President -in - O ffice of the Council, and I would person ally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency
P le ase allow me to rem ark on how well - vers ed and well -in f orm ed he is on European affair s
Un fortun ately, in my case, he did not provide what I would call a satis fact ory answer
S ince the Council recogn ises the fact that culture is a major economic as se t , it should , in my view, demonstr ate this in practice
S ay ing that the cultural di men sion is govern ed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am a f ra id , just an ex cu se
My question , which has not been answer ed, is wh y, when the European Parliament is look ing to increase appropri ations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union, the Council and the Commission are c ut ting back on appropri ations and at tim es c ut ting them out al t og ether
This is a true example of the Council ' s indi ffer ence towards culture , despite its ass ur an ces to the cont r ary that it is a matter to which it att ach es great importance
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared h ence fort h to support culture with the same read iness as it support ed ban an as , h op s, c ow s and Ind ian he mp
Mr Mar in o s, we are not adop ting a p ure ly economic approach to man ag ing the Portuguese Presidency , and therefore, the cultural di men sion is, I am sure you will app re ci ate, one of our main concerns
These cultural di men sion s, however, al most always have their own economic di men sion in turn , that is the level of resources which can be call ed on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives
This is a di men sion which it is difficult to go be y ond within the framework of the European Union, and especially within the framework of the Council
For our part , we shall be attemp ting to strengthen and con so lid ate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sp h ere , because we believe that this is an i d enti f ying fe at ure which is crucial to the Union' s im age and to the Union' s own particular i den tit y
This is, and will continue to be , conn ect ed with develop ments within the W or ld T ra de O r gan isation
As you know , both we and the Council have address ed this issue appropriate ly. In specific term s, we have been able to find a common l ang u age in terms of the m and ate given to the Commission for the next r ound of W T O negoti ations, at which this will be a central issue
N ever thel ess, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the a ud i ov is ual di men sion , the Portuguese Presidency will be pay ing very close attention to ext ending and en r ich ing European a ud i ov is ual policy by adop ting a M edi a - P l us programme which could go some way towards all ay ing Europe ' s main fear s
We also intend to initi ate a new debate , a more innov ative one , on the issue of Europe ' s f il m her it age , given that this must be one of the most important fact ors in the development of a European cultural i den tit y and of a European a ud i ov is ual economy
The Presidency will also concentr ate on discussion s about creating a di g ital te le vision system in Europe, which will be the subject of a con ference that we shall be organ ising during the Portuguese Presidency , in con j unction with the Commission, in F e b ru ary 2000
But , Mr Mar in o s, in the EU context , culture is an issue which is repe ated ly raised in connection with IGC ag end as
If , by ch ance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural di men sion in what has been call ed the f if th negoti ating bo x of the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference , then this could be suggest ed, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the prepar atory group
Of course, if cons ens us could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference , there might event ually be progress
It remain s to be seen whether or not there is a cons ens us on this
We will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any sugg es tions on this issue
Mr President, I j o in others in wish ing Portug al every good wish for a successful presid ency
I no tice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wish ed it, you would consider it
We ll , I , and my fe llow 3 5 B ri tis h Con s erv ative M E P s wish it and would like you to ple ase consider it
I app re ci ate that it is a pro v oc ative question
It is me ant to pro vo ke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it des er ves
We have to find some way of put ting press ure on such countries to do just that so we can recon n ect with our citizens
I cannot think of a better way to do it
C an you ?
The issue is whether the European di men sion will become strong er or weak er as a result of being specifically integr ated into the Trea ties
This is an issue which, as you will understand , will have to be address ed at IGC level and is an issue that only a S pe cial European Council can author ise the Portuguese Presidency to purs ue , because this kind of issue fall s outside the institution al framework in which the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference will take place
Intergovernmental Con fer ences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Ch r ist m as t ree
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues , which c ro p up again and again , and which are pass ed from one con ference to another , may be address ed
The problem fa cing us at the moment is whether there is currently a cons ens us within the European Union on this issue being includ ed, particularly bear ing in mind that if one such issue is includ ed, other issues of a sim ilar nature will prob ably be add ed to the con ference ' s agenda
Mr D im it ra k op ou l os has the f lo or for a proced ural motion
I would ask him to be brief
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly
I li k ed what Mr S e i x as d a C ost a said about F ather Ch r ist m as
In S p ain they say a let ter to the three k ings
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already s ent a let ter to the three k ings through its report s
N ow the Presidency and the Council have to bring the present s which we have asked them for in our let ter to the three k ings
As I su s pect ed, it was not exact ly a proced ural motion , but more a clos ing of the debate
We thank Mr S e i x as d a C ost a, but he can also wr ite his let ter to the three k ings
I would mere ly say that the f es tive issue which Mr D im it ra k op ou l os has raised is an extremely important one
The problem is that in this case F ather Ch r ist m as has to follow or d ers and therefore he can only give present s when he is author ised by others to do so
It is not the Portuguese Presidency ' s job to hand out the present s that everyone want s, especially those that the European Parliament is ask ing for
A fter this inter es ting exchange of opinion s, and in accordance with the R ul es of Pro ced ure , I would like to tell you that Ques tions N os 1 7 to 2 7 will be rep li ed to in w ri ting
That conclud es questions to the Council
C ap ital tax
The next item is the joint debate on :
the or al question ( B 5- 000 4 /2 000 ) by Mr D é si r and other s, to the Council, on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax
the or al question ( B 5- 000 5 /2 000 ) by Mr D é si r and other s, to the Commission, on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax
Madam President, Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, Commissioner, during the A si an crisis in 1997 , as with those which h it M e x ic o in 199 5 or the E M S in 199 3 , everyone could see the damage caus ed to the econom ies of entire countries by financial specul ation, particularly currency specul ation
B et ween EUR 1 5 00 and 2 0 00 b illion are tra d ed every day on the financial market s. In three or four day s, this can equal the total f ig ure of ann ual global produ ction , or global G D P , of appro x im ately EUR 6 0 00 b illion
The b ul k of these financial trans ac tions are p ure ly specul ative and do not involve any trade in goods or invest ments
Y et the e r ra tic movement of these m as sive su ms of capital can , in a few h our s, cause the co ll ap se of a currency or the economy of a country , pl un g ing its whole population into re ces sion
In view of this situ ation, renew ed interest has been expressed in the proposal by J am es Tobin , w in ner of the N ob el P ri z e for E conom ic s, to create a tax on currency trans action s. The r ate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or invest ment s, but it would act as a light b ra ke on the wh eel s of specul ation, there b y chec k ing the mul ti p lic ation of short -term trans ac tions
N ote that this proposed tax , which seems to be produ cing strong em o tions in some people , would be the low est tax in the world and the low est in the hist ory of global tax ation. Y et it would represent the rec ap t ure of the areas se i zed from democracy by the financial sp h ere
One reason for the accept ance of this proposal , and of the c amp a ign s by N G O s such as A T T A C , S O L I D A R or others which have po p ular ised this proposal , is that it would rele ase resources which could be alloc ated to development programmes in the po ore st countries, in areas such as e du c ation or health
It could act as a kind of as se t red ist rib ution in a world where there is both increasing we alth and increasing po ver ty
M an y person al ities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the B ra z ili an President, F ern and o C ard o so , the Fin n ish Government , the C an ad ian Parliament last Mar ch and also L ion el J os p in in 199 5
This question has been deb ated in several national parliament s of the EU
The common response has been that this tax could not be appli ed so le ly at national level and that the right pl at f orm for t ack ling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the or al question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 3 7 other Members
This motion ask s the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six months on the fe a sibility of this tax . It also ask s for an exam in ation of the press ures and financial s an ctions which could be appli ed against countries which encoura ge tax e v asion or which maintain tax ha ven s
The motion also ask s that a position document , dra wn up by the Commission and Council, should be sub mitted before the next ann ual meeting of the I M F
The European Union must take the initiative and must also , as demand ed in the motion , propose this initiative to the G 7 because it is pri m arily a political question
If the Union takes the initiative , this will have a r at ch et effect because this debate is occ urr ing all over the world , including in the U S A and J ap an . A des ire is being expressed every wh ere with increasing force that the world should not be rul ed by tra d ers but by the people , their parliament s, their governments and their democratic institutions
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happ y that today, with this debate and this motion , this question is now on the agenda of European con struction
Madam President, I do not have a great deal to add on this subject
The Council has not yet discuss ed the possibility of introdu cing a tax on move ments of capital as Pro f ess or Tobin suggest ed
This is a cre ative initiative , which we know has been wel com ed by different industri es ac ross the world and by various s id es in European politic s, but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue
As it fall s to the Commission to propose any such initiative , the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue
Madam President, the re ven ue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short -term exchange trans ac tions
S uch trans action s, according to the argu ment , bear very little relation to fundamental economic var i abl es
This has also just been under l ined by Mr D é si r
Therefore , according to prop on ent s, such as Mr D é si r , an intern ation ally appli ed Tobin tax would , in principle , redu ce specul ative trans ac tions and, h ence, the vol a til ity of exchange r ates , which would lead to an improve ment in economic pro s per ity
T aking into account the consider able vol u me of short -term financial st ream s, even a low n om in al Tobin tax would y ield respect able su ms of tax re ven ue
In reality , the mo tive under ly ing the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sour ces of international fin ance in the m id - n ine ties was non- ec on om ic . Inde ed, it was f ue ll ed by the potential of this tax to gener ate inc ome for international , public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was ris ing quickly and funding was increasing ly hard er to come by
The Commission rec ently obs er ved renew ed interest in a global tax , such as the Tobin tax , as a means of achie ving so cially responsible global is ation, so to speak
Mr D é si r too has mentioned this grow ing interest on all s id es
But if the Tobin tax were to be appli ed un il ater ally in order to prevent att ack s on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market
P ut more strong ly, in the long term it is possible that for large number s of fund s, the Tobin tax will be e v ad ed by sh if ting fore ign exchange r ate trans ac tions to off -s h ore tax ha ven s
In that case, the tax could lead to a net l os s of total economic pro s per ity
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a su fficient number of industri al ised countries which are prepared to particip ate
Finally, even if the Tobin tax is design ed to c ur b specul ations with curr en ci es, there is still the risk that even non- s pe cul ative st ream s would be affect ed, and that is not the intention
For the reason s set out above , I cannot see a good reason for introdu cing a European Tobin tax
At any r ate, the Commission is against any attemp t to restric t capital movement within the European Union
In more direct term s, to the extent that this measure could be de em ed an ind ire ct restric tion on capital st ream s, this would contra ven e the Treaty of R ome
The correct specul ative approach , it seems to me , is to rem ove the real caus es which lead to financial ch a o s, rather than attemp ting to supp ress its sy mp t om s by introdu cing ob st ac les to the oper ation of the market s
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like once again to say a few words on the mod us oper and i and the ide ological t ac tic s behind this or al question
Al so because I know how many social dem ocrat s in this House share our critic ism, and not just the economic and financial policy exper ts
We know what the problem is : inst ability on the market s as the result of specul ation
But the people ask ing the question need to know that not every inst ance of inst ability , as the Commissioner has just so imp res sive ly to ld us, is the result of specul ation
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the cris es in the E EA in 199 2 and 199 3 or the cris es in the s ou th - e ast A si an curr en ci es in 1997
The initi at ors of this question do not propose a solution ; inst ead they are call ing for a new b ur den , they are call ing for more bureauc ra cy , for a measure which run s c oun ter to the market m ech an is ms and they are taking up pl en ary ' s time with an inter g roup opinion which exc lud es the compe t ent parliament ary committee , cont r ary to several resolution s by Parliament
In my view, and I say this quite clear ly, the question is ide olog ic ally mo tiv ated rather than solution -f oc us ed
I consider this to be the wr ong way forward for several reason s
Wh y do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so question able ?
First , and the Commissioner has also confirm ed this, because it pla ces a he av y b ur den on the capital market s
E ven a small tax would have serious rep erc us sion s on the capital market s, because this s ort of specul ation tax would redu ce the pro fit ability of invest ments consider ably
In addition , this s ort of measure would also serious ly ha mp er the development of the financial market s and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital , which is one of the central t en et s of the internal market
Secondly, specul ative capital is extremely difficult to i d enti f y
Th ird ly, un less they are introdu ced in all countries at the same time, tax measures are e as y to circ um vent because there are other wise too many lo oph ol es
F our th ly, techn ic ally spe aking , this measure is high ly imp rac tic able and will result in a great deal of bureauc ra cy and administration and be imp os sible to control
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today
We need strong er b ank ing superv ision
We need to cl ar if y the liability for trans ac tions
We need a framework of regulations at international level
We need to exam ine national law s in order to chec k that they comp ly with the rules of the B as le committee and how the dis se mination of these rules can be st e pp ed up
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stand s. I refer to point 9
Ha ving list en ed to the Commissioner just now , we know that the Commission' s know ledge of the fact s will result in a ' n o ' to the Tobin tax
If the know ledge of the fact s and this debate and the argu ments are as we say, and I think that they are right , then to take up another six months of the Commission' s time and occasion un c ertain ty on the financial and capital market s would be ir res pon sible
The capital market s do not want un c ertain ty from us, they want cl arity ; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a sp l it vote
Madam President, the debate on a tax on short -term financial actions is not a new one
We have been discuss ing the Tobin tax proposal for tw ent y years and yet the question is still top ical because we need really conc re te and hon est ans w ers based on careful stud ies
We need to know just how des i ra ble and fe a sible a tax on short -term trans ac tions really is
This question has now enter ed a different di men sion , a di men sion in which U S D 1 5 00 b illion ro am the world tw ent y -f our h our s a day look ing for att ra ctive invest ment s, no more than 3 % of which have any thing to do with the real economy
We are concerned about st ability on the financial market s, not for the s ake of the financial market s, but because this has to do with own grow th , our own invest ments and our own jobs in the European Union
We must ask what instru ments we can use in order to create the order here which has been mis s ing in the past
We have done every thing to help li beral ise financial trans action s, but so far we have had no working set of rul es, as we have le arn ed from the b it ter less ons of the rep erc us sion s of the A si an and L a tin Am er ic an cris es
It is therefore high time that we thought both about superv is ory regulations and about transparency on the financial market s and their information
It is important that we know who the act ors are and what their cre d it ra ting is
We must also ask if there is not a need for f is c al justice
At a time when the tax b ur den on the work fact or is increasing throughout Europe and intern ation ally, we must consider how we can achieve effic ient tax ation of invest ment inc ome and that includ es the question of how to tax short -term financial trans ac tions
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusion s from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achie ves real international solidarity with the U S A and J ap an in making the economy and the financial market s more st able and sec ure
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the or d in ary proced ures of report s from comm itt ees and pl en ary debate in order to reach a bal an ced and really forward - lo ok ing proposal
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Li beral , Dem ocrat and R ef orm Par t y, I must express my sur pr ise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible tax ation which, although it does not mention it in the text , appe ar s to be an attemp t to rev ive , as the introdu ction has done , the issue of the tax proposed some years ag o by Mr Tobin , which our Group opp os ed, clearly and tot ally, during the last legisl at ure , with a seri es of argu ments clearly and co her ently expressed by our President, Mr C o x
I will have to repe at these argu ment s, mod est ly, in this inter vention , because the same issue has ar is en once again
We do not agree with this type of tax because its applic ation, in the event that it could happen , would not achieve the aim s which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Le ft in this House wishes to rev ive
Firstly, there is no e vid ence that the tax on international capital move ments could redu ce the dang ers of vol a til ity and inst ability in the international market s
On the cont r ary , since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to specul ation and fraud and that really would create vol a til ity , inst ability , in sec urity , op ac ity and un f air competition in the field of financial services oper ating on an international level
F urther more, the idea of ob tain ing resources to apply them to the more economic ally need y countries present s such comple x ity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appe ar s simply imp os sible
This is a f al se debate whose aim is p ure ly political , and has no basis or technical vi ability
F urther more - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not man aged the s light est agreement with regard to the p ack age of f is c al measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a f is c al agreement on an international level ?
I supp ose that the first thing they say will be , ' le t us see whether you are cap able of reach ing a f is c al agreement within the Union'
However, the Li beral Group has not want ed to close the do or to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have ac cep ted a joint motion for a resolution propos ing that a stud y be carried out on the possibility and su it ability of imp os ing this tax on certain areas of international capital move ments
I am sure that this stud y - if carried out objective ly, with know ledge of the financial market s and their m ech an is ms on an international level - will show that it is ne ither su it able n or possible , not only in terms of its applic ation, but also as a means of achie ving the proposed objectives
In itself , global isation is positive
The economy has never g ro wn so much n or fa v ou red so many countries on a global level
This is due to prog res sive open ing up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater cap ac ity for ad equ ate movement of capital
An y analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective , will show , through the f ig ure s, that they have no political col our or o ri ent ation
As I have said, we are not opp osed to such a stud y
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this stud y, but we simply ins ist that, as this motion for a resolution points out , it is by means of li beral isation and open ing up at an international level that we will achieve economic prog res s, both on the level of states and on a general level
Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not li e in the ide olog y of the debate but in its political nature
As Mrs R and z i o - P l ath said, we must re me mber that the reason why certain Members want to rev ive this question is because of the recent international financial cris es and their economic , social and environmental consequ ences which have been f el t by all in some countries
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instru ments available to the international community for st ab il ising the international financial and mon etary system
In this respect , Mr B ol k est e in , the motion for a resolution cannot be s ep ar ated from the issue of the Tobin tax
If you look careful ly, this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instru ments aim ed at for cing international invest ors to beh ave respon sib ly on the financial market s
Secondly, the motion does not say that we want a so le ly European initiative
This is why we exp lic it ly refer to the a ut um n s ession of the Intern ational Mon etary Fund so that the European Union, in other words the Commission and also the Council, can dec ide how it will def end the opportunity to st ab il ise the international financial and mon etary system and introdu ce international tax ation
There should be no conf u sion in this debate. As environmental ist s, we do not want an ex cu se for a motion
Al though a stud y produ ced by the Commission would doubt less be inter es ting , we do not need another to add to those already available
We do need to ob tain , from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments form ing the Union, a clear , positive or ne g ative , political st ance . They must indic ate whether they are read y to def end , within compe t ent public bod ies such as the Intern ational Mon etary Fund in the first inst ance, the appropri at en ess of such a tax within the other instru ments needed to st ab il ise the international mon etary system
As for the argu ment that this initiative would increase un c ertain t y, very short -term capital move ments are specifically intend ed to play on un c ertain ty and to bet on changes between curr en ci es or various short -term financial as se ts
This argu ment is therefore not rele vant
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their argu ments
However, I would high light not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph 1 0
We clearly expect a political st ance to be taken with a very firm de ad line of the prepar ations for the a ut um n s ession of the Intern ational Mon etary Fund . We therefore demand , if this motion is adopted tomorrow , that the Commission and Council appe ar before Parliament to tell us what posi tions they will take on this occasion
Madam President, my Group is extremely de light ed that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have sp ared no effort al ong with Members of other groups to bring this about
Ob vious ly we all have different approach es which is demonstr ated by our debate and the mo tions for a resolution tabled at the begin ning
Ha ving said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the comprom ise motion represent s
This inv it es the Commission to present a report within six months
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative , even if it does so tim id ly, on this subject . However, I agree with the previous speak er that, if paragraph 9 were chall eng ed, this motion would clearly l ose its sub st ance
This debate concerns a v ital question which increasing number s of people are leg iti m ately ra is ing. What are the res pe ctive pla ces of people and fin ance in today ' s economy ?
U S D 1 8 00 b illion is the vol u me of money mo ved every day in the world ' s currency market s. This represent s over a qu arter of the ann ual global vol u me of trade in goods and services
B y put ting fin ance at the hel m , this has re in for ced the demand s of pro fit ability and to u gh en ed the oper ating conditions every wh ere
It has l ed to a grow th in m erg ers, ac qu is i tions and compan y rest ruct uring and to g ig an tic su ms being raised with increasing f re qu ency on the financial market s
Un e mployment and press ure on employ ees world w ide is increasing
O p en ings and real grow th are being ha mp er ed and the su d den inf lu x or with d ra w al of specul ative capital is threat ening the econom ies of many countries, to the point of co ll ap se , as in A si a, R us si a and B ra z il
F ac ed with this ne o li beral global isation d om in ated by the financial market s, demand , as our motion recogn is es, is develop ing from a different idea of the world in which common law sti pul ates a d ut y of solidarity in an increasing ly inter d epend ent world
No one can i gn ore the challenge to civil isation pos ed by the lack of ne ar ly one b illion jobs and the need to make un p re ced ent ed efforts in terms of development and access to information
In this respect , all ide as des erve to be consider ed, including the Tobin tax which is important , just like other for ms of trans action which may be env is aged
This tax could help to chec k specul ation without p en al ising the activities of the real econom y. It could rele ase new resources for invest ment in people and, at a time when the U N D P es tim ates the su m needed to e ra dic ate po ver ty to be U S D 4 0 b illion per year , it could allow access for everyone to d r ink ing water and satis f y health needs
When the debate on the ab ility of politic s to inf lu ence economic s goes global , the establish ment of this tax could become one of the sy mb ol s of the political des ire to rec ap t ure the democratic areas se i zed by the international financial oper at ors
The Commissioner has said that a min imum number of industri al ised countries would be needed to achieve this
I would point out that the European Union is comp osed of a large number of industri al ised countries and, like Mr D é si r and several other speak ers, I feel that the European Union which we are form ing can take the initiative in this respect
In any case, the European Parliament would be hon ou red to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well -b e ing for everyone
Madam President, I too am de light ed that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming
We know that each gener ation has , over the course of time, b l ind ly b ought into what could be call ed a d om in ant ide olog y. This is a set of pre j ud ic es ac cep ted as such due to a general conf orm ism, but whose dra m atic nature can be seen by sub sequ ent gener ations
F ree trade and the con st ant wor s hip of global isation are now the d om in ant ide olog y or , rather , the b ig m ist ake of our fin de si è c le . This ide olog y is as dangerous as the form er ide olog y of the d ict at ors hip of the pro le t ar i at in the cor ri d ors of the K re m lin or , before that, the certain t y, ele v ated to the stat us of a do g m a, that the ear th was f l at
Our world is now d om in ated by a single l og ic or , I could say, a single g od of money at work inst ead of people at work
With a f ig ure for trade in goods and services of F R F 3 6 0 00 b illion only being equal to the product of four day s ' specul ation, the financial b ub ble o w es very little to the produ ctive activ ity of individual s
It is s el f- per pe t u ating in a world of ever high er b id s which con st ant ly d en ies the human ity of man , the r ich as much as the po or . Y et it is the l at ter who , at the end of the day , are exc lud ed from the majority of the world ' s decision -m aking cent res for these are mon op ol ised by a t in y min ority refer red to recent ly, and very ap t ly, by J e an - P i er re Ch e v è ne ment as the global ised é l it es
It was nat ural that these é l it es would exc lud e any political concerns from their field of man o e u v re , th us prot ec ting themselves from any democratic control and basic ally man ag ing to be both i l leg iti m ate and ir res pon sible
However, the people are f igh ting back , as demonstr ated by their re action during the incre di ble S e at t le S um mit . The lead ers of the world , he ad ed unfortun ately by the European Commission, r us h ed forward sub m is sive ly, h op ing that their do cil ity at the fe et of the m ast er of the world , Mr C l int on , would be enough to ensure them the sc ra p s from the t able
Y et they rec k on ed without the s al ut ary re action of the no b od ies, both individual s and States. This re action was more organ ised than previous ly, due in France particularly to the m ag n ific ent A T T A C net work which is f igh ting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish tax ation of international financial trans ac tions in particular
The cre ation of this tax ation, of either the Tobin type or the more real istic type proposed by Pro f ess or L a ur é , could pro ve to be politic ally opportun e, at least due to its sy mb ol ism rather than its low r ate. This is because it would basic ally mean that politic s was reg ain ing a fo oth o ld in an area from which it has been exc lud ed by oper at ors whose pro fit s are prop or tion al to the de g ree of res ign ation of States
Madam President, although some of the aim s of the Tobin tax are fa ir ly worth y of support , introdu cing the tax exc lu sive ly within the ter rit ory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so , would s ound the de ath k ne ll for the European currency market s
If the world ' s other important currency tra d ing areas were to be exc lud ed from the Tobin tax , the fact that tax was li able to be pa id in Europe would lead to currency deal ing mo ving to those areas
This has already been made clear a number tim es in this debate
It is not enough that all the world ' s industri al ised countries should be included in the sch e me , as then currency tra d ing would move to tax ha ven s outside that group of countries
There should therefore be a un i vers al application : it is not enough that the G 7 countries or the other industri al ised countries are involved
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the sch e me into force every wh ere in the world at precisely the same time - and person ally spe aking , I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax d ream might as well be b ur ied
F urther more, although there might be international cons ens us on the introdu ction of the sch e me , the question would remain regarding how the tax re ven ue would be dist rib ut ed
The world ' s currency deal ing cent res will hard ly agree to the tax re ven ue being us ed, for example, for a var i ety of well - me an ing, U N -b ack ed purp os es throughout the world without a consider able amount of the re ven ue remain ing with them
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of pre ven ting future currency cris es, it has to be real ised that the caus es of a currency being over val u ed cannot be a ver ted through tax ation
For that reason , as Mr K ar as also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being over val u ed in relation to its act ual potential value
This again would require measures to regul ate the exp ort ation and import ation of capital ; other wise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way
Al though it seems a reason able sch e me , the Tobin tax is not without its problem s, even if there should be agreement as to its implement ation, which I do not believe there will
It has to be re me mber ed that money at present is first and fore most inform ation, and that the global economy will , in the future , r ot ate more and more on the basis of information and int el lect ual capital
For that reason , the un in ter ru p ted f low of as se ts in m as sive vol um es between the world ' s financial cent res is not mere ly specul ative activ ity , which has nothing to do with the real economy
If this ' fe ed b ack ' m ech an ism, which gi ves us ers the opportunity to make ch o ic es, were ha mp er ed by measures such as the Tobin tax , m ist ak en decisions might be made that turn ed out to be so cost ly in terms of the economic consequ ences that the tax would never be able to make up for it
H ence, as Mr K ar as has st ated to his cre d it , our Group is res olute ly opp osed to the introdu ction of the Tobin tax
Madam President, I speak as some one who is in support of a tax on specul ative capital move ments ac ross currency b ord ers
It seems to me b l ind ing ly s el f- e vid ent that some action is necessary
In the last 3 0 years, the vol u me of currency trans ac tions has increased by 8 3 tim es : first ly, total global res er ves of all central ban ks b are ly amount s to one day of fore ign exchange tra d ing ; second ly, ann ual global trade in real goods and services equ als just three - and - a - h alf day s of fore ign exchange market s out of 3 5 0 , that is, 1 % of capital move ments are for trade in goods and services and 9 9 % are for specul ation
The si z e, un p red ict ability and ir r ational ity of the global fore ign exchange market s have made it hard er and hard er to manage national and regional econom ies
C om p ut er - con t ro ll ed se ll ing programmes turn ed a r and om b li p into an av al an ch e, b ur ying job s, li ves and industri es ac ross the glo b e
The only argu ments against it are : first ly, it would imp air the efficiency of the fore ign exchange market - a little f an ci ful in light of the financial fe ed ing f r en z ies we have seen that have d est ro y ed jobs throughout the world , in East A si a, Europe and L a tin Am er ic a
Mr Ch i rac has des c rib ed those who en g age in this as the A id s v ir us of the world economy
What is necessary is to th row some sa nd into the wh eel s of the currency specul ator s, st ock b ro k ers and op tion tra d ers
Of course, this cannot be done in one country ; it cannot be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation
Europe, J ap an and the U S - the e uro , the y en and the do ll ar , would constit ute , in my opinion, such a b l ock
I am dis app oint ed in the E P P
I thought at least they read the resolution s they were going to vote on
Y es, I am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to stud y the matter , to look at what step s and what conditions would be necessary for the introdu ction of such a tax
E qu ally I understand the Commissioner fail ing to end or se such a tax , but I cannot understand why he fail ed to have the c oura ge to welcome the opportunity to demonstr ate the tr uth of his position by a stud y of the issue
There is nothing so cl osed as a cl osed mind
The tax has the support of 4 7 % of the people in the U K , according to a recent sur ve y by W ar on W ant
In France it has had en orm ous res on ance, particularly when link ed to a demand to use the proceed s to help the Th ird W or ld out of its deb t and po ver ty
This issue can no longer be i gn ore d by Parliament, the Council or the Commission
There is now a we ight of public opinion demand ing an answer more s oph istic ated than : " I t has not been done before "
In the new m ill en n ium , with new global problems requ ir ing new global solution s, they need to give good argu ments why it cannot be done now , rather than why it has not been done in the past
Madam President, Commissioner, a comprom ise resolution on the use ful ness of a tax on international financial f low s would constit ute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rul es. I have two or three points to make in this respect
One of the main demand s of the demonst rat ors in S e at t le was , right ly, the establish ment of this type of tax , and this is not by ch ance
The proposal of this tax today s end s out a strong sign al from the r ich European countries pro ving that they want to move away from the culture of e go ism
E ver y one feel s that this kind of joint tax is a v ir t u ous measure which does not prevent trade but is aim ed pri m arily at specul ation and its per ver se effect s. The Members on the right should note this
It sy mb ol ises the need for solidarity with the countries of the s ou th , particularly those in A f ric a, the C ar ib b e an and the P a ci fic which question ed us ext ensive ly on this subject in S e at t le
In order to fully achieve its objective , the money supp ly rele ased by such a tax must be red ist rib ut ed among the po ore st countries
This is how we can give sense and mor ality to the comm er cial rules and show solidarity with the people of the s ou th
Madam President, we cannot just keep repe ating the number which several previous speak ers have qu oted ; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 8 0% of these h uge , d a ily fore ign exchange s al es have an invest ment term of no more than e ight day s
We cannot maintain a situation in which invest ments and the cre ation of jobs are less l uc ra tive than short -term s al es of fore ign currency and sh a res
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to d est ro y the opportunity to take political action
We cannot maintain a situation in which inc ome from non- ec on om ic activities increas es more and more quickly
It has been demonstr ated in German y that inc ome from mon etary as se ts has al most doub led from 7 . 6 % of over all economic inc ome since Tobin develop ed his idea
We cannot maintain a situation in which the po ore st countries of the world are most exp osed to the specul ative argu ments sur round ing short -term currency f lu ct u ations
N or do I believe that this is imp rac tic able
Wh y should it not be possible for the G 7 countries, the other EU Member States, Ch in a, S ing ap ore and S w it z er land to come to an agreement on the introdu ction of the Tobin tax ?
There must be an over ri d ing economic interest
Wh y should it be imp rac tic able , and it can be differ enti at ed, to imp ose this tax on sp ot fore ign exchange trans action s, all the so -c all ed cas h trans action s, currency fut ures and op tions ?
Wh y should it be imp rac tic able to set this tax at a r ate which does not j e op ard ise the long -term invest ments needed by the economy but which fin ally makes short -term and specul ative invest ments un at t ra ctive
N um erous very difficult questions are b ound to ar ise , but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St . F l or ian principle of sh if ting responsibility from one ag ency to another which has now taken hold
Madam President, we are not ask ing for more bureauc ra cy , as Mr K ar as put it just a few min utes ag o
We are look ing for solution s
Of course capital market s need cl arity - that is actually the idea
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obs c ure question
" T he more progress is made towards trade li beral is ation, the more rules are needed " , as Commissioner L am y said during the M ill en n ium R ound in S e at t le
He recogn ised that the comb ined imp act of the single market and the single currency that ch ar ac ter ise the process of the European Union 's con struction is in tim ately link ed to a h uge amount of new regulations
N ow that finan cing is read ily available ac ross national b ound ar ies without any difficult y the same approach will obvious ly be str ict ly necessary , all the more so as we consider that an en orm ous amount every single day is employ ed in specul ative trans ac tions
We citizens of the world cannot aff ord the current r ate of specul ation
To continue would be economic su ic ide
H on oura ble Member s, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has suc ceed ed in st ab il ising the economic sector , but this is only true if we conf ine ourselves p ure ly to the public sector
If we look at the priv ate sector , however, we will find not only that this fa b led ' f in an cial st ability ' has been un s uc cess ful but that we are most prob ably sitting on a vol c an o read y to e ru p t at any moment
The deb t b ur d ens of the priv ate sector and the cor res pon d ing ex ces sive inf l ation of St ock E x ch ange sec ur ities, the two main market st ability indic ator s, have , for some time, been at dang er level s, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly i ll ust r ates
The fact that the public accept s such r ates and does not just ab and on all financial activities in a p an ic can be explain ed by over am b iti ous expect ations over future g ain s
S pe cul ative activities are grow ing be y ond measure and are , in turn , gener ating pro fit s which will event ually pro ve to be mere ly f ic ti ti ous
O ver - op tim ism will give way to dis app oint ment and fear , which, in turn , will result in a st ock market and economic crisis
The dang er is too great for us to i gn ore
We o u ght to face it regard less of how difficult it may seem
M od ern economic sci ence has provided an excep tion al instrument with the Tobin proposal and other s, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start
That is what we are lack ing, Commissioner : the political will to make a start in t ack ling specul ation
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the wor s hip of , or for this f at al ist approach to ward s, market for ces as adopted by the li ber als - and I am s or ry that Mr G as ò li b a I B ö h m has left - as this will only lead to its r u in
Madam President, Mr B ol k est e in , the i gn or ance sur round ing this debate is un b e lie v able
We needed a G ree k Member to fin ally tell us what this Tobin tax means
You reject it f l at ly because you do not understand the first thing about it
That the Right opp os es tax es is quite understand able , ex cept that they should never have been allow ed to spirit their million s, or rather b illion s, into S w it z er land
We all know that !
But now I call on you, in all cons ci ous n ess, to help put a st op to specul ative financial trans ac tions and under min ing long -term projects with long -term capital
It has never been done in s ou th - e ast A si a, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr K ar as from Austria has left the ch am ber , given Austria ' s financial rec ord
They are all t ar red with the same d ir ty b r us h !
We need a Tobin tax to give us a f is c al instrument with which we can inter ven e
Madam President, I am tot ally app all ed by the Commission' s , i.e. Mr B ol k est e in ' s , political i gn or ance !
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask him self why he is here at all !
Madam President, I too have found part s of the debate quite b i z ar re
It is perhaps not by ch ance that the Con s erv ative b ench es have emp ti ed because that which is represent ed as market freedom no longer has any thing in common with the no ble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much pro s per ity to us here in w es tern Europe over recent dec ad es
If we continue down this p ath , and this is the ide olog y, and dec la re the financial market s to be sa c ros an ct and even cla im that any inter vention in the work ings of these market s is cont r ary to progress and cont r ary to the grow th of the econom y, then we will quite certainly be on the wr ong t ack and that could take on quite dangerous prop or tions
Th ose who own the mon etary as se ts are currently am ass ing h uge for t un es which are again sc ream ing out to be re in ves ted
We have as se t inf l ation of global prop or tions
As a result , specul ative b ub b les contin ually ar ise on the financial market s, caus ing grow ing economic inst ability which, in turn , j e op ard ises the entire economy
And it is precisely the medium -si zed undert aking s and large number s of employ ees who su ffer as a result
We can take action against this ; it is possible
The min imum requirements for this would be for a proper stud y to be carried out at long last , not only by the Commission, but by rep ut able economic ins tit utes throughout Europe
That too is fe a sible
And then perhaps everyone will st op b and ying about argu ments which are ask ing for t rou ble !
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is techn ic ally imp rac tic able - it is quite fe a sible in the a ge of the comp ut er
The fact that tax ha ven s are f re qu ently nothing but hard dis k st or age sp ace for large European ban ks here at home must not be i gn ore d
In short , we must not allow real capital and specul ative capital to become so rem ote from each other , because other wise we shall be st e er ing towards situ ations which we experi en ced on this contin ent time and again during the last cent ur y and which had c at ast ro ph ic results
Madam President, let us indeed tax money specul ation : it does not produ ce any thing new
The tax would be t ar get ed at the right place : at the specul at ors
Wh o is going to def end these specul ator s, when n urs es and te ach ers are pay ing top r ates of tax ?
Article 7 3 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provid es scope for tax ation on trans ac tions
Th ose who opp ose tax ation on currency deal ing are in favour of those tax - re cyc ling cent re s, the tax ha ven s, of which there are 6 2 in all
The Union should make a tax p act , which any countries could initi ally be party to
The low r ate Tobin tax would not cause tax - re cyc ling problems
It is str ange to cla im that if everyone is not included it would be imp os sible to bring into effect
The European Union was found ed through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today
The tr uth is the gre ates t problem is a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but ra ise person al tax ation inst ead
In the end tax would politic ise the global , u nd em ocra tic system of financial power
L adies and gentlemen, we must challenge the mon op o ly the world ' s specul ative el ite have on planning the world ' s economy by remain ing outside the tax system
Madam President, may I begin by ext ending a hear t f el t than ks to all speak ers and, above all of course, Mr D é si r , for the fact that this debate is taking place this even ing
Wh ate ver one may think about the top ic of debate , it is e vid ent that it is an important one
This is why it has been a round for years, and it is satis f ying that the Commission is being aff ord ed the opportunity this even ing to give a response
I would like to start by under l ining two rem ark s made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr G as ò li b a
He said that global isation is a positive ph en omen on , and I share his view
I believe that global isation has help ed many countries which, so far , have been on the s id el ine of the world trade st ream s to particip ate in these and be incorpor ated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware , no country has ever been wor se off by particip ating in international trade
In other words, as indeed already rem ark ed by Mr G as ò li b a, global isation is, in my view, positive , and I am of the opinion that it has contrib ut ed to a new international dist rib ution of l ab our which has been purs u ed by many people for many years
A second rem ark made by Mr G as ò li b a was that there is currently no e vid ence that the Tobin tax will st ab il ise the exchange r ates
I think that he is correct in this regard
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange r ate trans ac tions would lead to a st ab il isation of exchange r ates
I am of the opinion that these are two important rem ark s, and that is why I am re iter ating them here
Madam President, could I further more point out that n one of the speak ers this even ing has dra wn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the function ing of the European Union on the other ?
S ure ly we are all fam ili ar with the Treaty of R ome and know that one of the four freedom s is the freedom of capital movement
Madam President, I can ass ure your Parliament that my day - t o - day work cons ists part ly of attemp ting , in con j unction with my offic es and colleagues , to completely integr ate the financial market s within Europe, th us en abl ing financial trans ac tions to run as e a si ly and sm o oth ly as possible
In my cap ac ity as Commissioner for the Intern al M ark et , I am , in other words, opp osed to all measures which ha mp er international financial trans ac tions
You could hard ly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact, imp ed e international economic movement
On ce again , the Tobin tax is, in my view, at o d d s with the Treaty of R ome , and this is an important , the ore tical objec tion which has not been considered by any of the speak ers this even ing
Madam President, ap art from these - to my mind - quite fundamental obs erv ations, there are also practical objec tions to the Tobin tax , as already under l ined by Mr K ar as and other speak ers
It has unfortun ately been obs erv ed, I have to say, that the European Union has fail ed to reach agreement intern ally on specific tax measures
This indic ates how difficult these do s si ers are
If we have not been able to reach agreement intern ally, I w on der whether we will then be able to conv ince the other trade partners
I think that this will be problem atic
Madam President, Mr J on ck he er has st ated that this could be one of the measures for st ab il ising the financial market s
I think , however, that inst ability is mere ly a sy mp t om and that we should be look ing at the under ly ing caus es. I think that it is pre fer able to fight the caus es rather than attemp t to t ack le the sy mp t om s when this is prob ably not possible and when , as already stat ed, the measure concerned is pre t ty certainly at o d d s with the Treaty of R ome
In order to rem ove these caus es, one has to look at what is happen ing in the countries in question
Is it the case that these countries can bo ast of what is term ed in En g lish ' go od govern ance ' ?
Is it the case that there is low inf l ation and that there are low interest r ates ?
That the market s for produ ction fact or s, including the l ab our market , oper ate flex ib ly ?
That is not always the case
So if we want to look into what caus es exchange r ate inst ability , then we need to take into account the ele ments of good govern ance and focus on these first
In addition - and this has also been mentioned alread y, for example by Mr G as ò li b a I B ö h m , but also by others - there is a need for more superv ision
M ore superv ision n ation ally - superv ision by national governments of national ban ks - and intern ation ally, for example by means of the I M F
So I believe the best way to t ack le the caus es is by ens uring , on the one hand, that good govern ance is obs er ved in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more superv ision n ation ally and intern ation ally in order to avoid these l aps es
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects
For example, Mr K re is s l - D ö r f ler sp o ke in En g lish about ' l ong -term capital for long -term projects ' - this is an obvious issue
My rep ly to this is that, first ly, countries should hon our their pl ed g es, namely make 0 . 7 % of their G ross N ational Pro du ct available for development aid and cooper ation, so that a great deal more money bec om es available than at present for such long -term projects and v ia a r out e established for the purp ose , namely contribution s to development cooper ation, and not v ia an ar ti fic ial and prob ably harm ful r out e, namely the Tobin tax
Madam President, I should like to le ave it here
As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft , the Commission will aw a it the vote and will , based on this, deter min e its st ance
I thank you for gi ving me the opportunity to take part in this debate
I have received four mo tions for a resolution , tabled purs u ant to R ule 4 0 ( 5 ) of the R ul es of Pro ced ure
Madam President, unfortun ately I do not have your m ast er y of the French l ang u age
But I would be oblig ed if Mr B ol k est e in would just list en for a min ute , which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs R and z i o - P l ath
C ould you ple ase draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him ?
Mon si eur B ol k est e in , j e v e u x v ous dire q ue l q ue ch ose !
Un fortun ately, my D ut ch is not as good as your s
But I would rather like to say something else to you
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supp or ting a Tobin type tax just to ann o y the Commission
We want to exam ine the possibility of introdu cing a Tobin tax
It will be just one of several instru ments and hope ful ly you will be on our s ide in this
F rom a political point of view, I always f ret when people say, we ne ither need , want n or can we achieve these things !
It is not your job , it is our job to dec ide on that
It also has something to do with the new ly aw ok en s el f- con s ci ous ness of this Parliament
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less
We can do so without going off at other t ang ent s. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who want s to take his work serious ly
P le ase respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work serious ly, and that includ es the Tobin tax !
Madam President, an o m ission appe ar s to have been made . In the list of tabled mo tions for a resolution which you have just read out , no mention is made of the comprom ise motion tabled joint ly by the P S E , E L D R , G U E / N G L and G re ens / E F A Group s and by Mrs K un t z and Mr C o û te au x
Mr D é si r , I note your comment and the exist ence of this joint motion for a resolution
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correct ly t abl ed, it will be included
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place on Th urs day at 12 . 00 p . m
( T he sitting was cl osed at 8 . 1 4 p . m. )
A d op tion of the Min utes of the previous sitting
Mr President, I simply want ed to pass on some new s. There was a terr or ist att ack this mor ning in Mad ri d
S ome one pl ant ed a car b om b and one person has di ed
On behalf of my Group , I once again con d em n these terr or ist act s
Thank you, Mrs F ra g a E st é ve z
We had he ard about this regret t able in cid ent
Un fortun ately, the terr or ist m ur der ers are once again p un ish ing S p anish soci et y. I note your comments with particular k een n ess, as you may expect , given that I too am S p anish
( T he Min utes were approved )
R es u mp tion of the s ession
I dec la re res um ed the s ession of the European Parliament ad j our n ed on F ri day , 2 1 J an u ary 2000
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second ann i vers ary of the C er m is tra ged y
T w o years ag o, in C a val ese in It al y, an Am er ic an a er op l an e from the A v ian o N A T O b ase c ut through the c abl es of a c able car during a low -f ly ing ex erc ise which ex ceed ed saf e limit s, caus ing the de ath s of more than 2 0 European s
S ince then , the vic ti ms ' fam ili es, who have not had the cons ol ation of justice , since the p il ot responsible has not fa ced criminal ch ar g es, have been aw a iting s olic it ous financial comp ens ation from the United States at the very least
I therefore appe al to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand sure ty for immedi ate comp ens ation from the U . S . author ities, and this is in order to up ho ld the rights of the vic ti ms ' fam ili es
Mrs An ge li ll i , thank you . I have taken note of your comment
Ag enda
The next item is the order of business
F o llow ing a request to this effect , which I have received from a number of political group s, and following the meeting of the Conference of President s which has just been held , I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a h alf h our debate on a top ical and urg ent subject of major importance , purs u ant to R ule 5 0 of our R ul es of Pro ced ure , on the subject of the European Union' s re action with regard to the t al ks in Austria on form ing a government
If you dec ide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introdu ced by speech es from Mr S e i x as d a C ost a, President -in - O ffice of the Council, and Mr R om an o Prodi, President of the Commission
Is there any one who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of President s, and, since I public ly critic ised the presid ency in J an u ary , I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Social ist Group , that we now find the presid ency ' s state ments on this issue to be appropriate , and we agree on their basis , their importance and their form
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to im ag ine a debate which is more in accordance with R ule 5 0 of our R ul es of Pro ced ure
This debate is top ical , excep tion ally important and urg ent
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amend ed to include it
(A pp la use )
Is there any one who wishes to speak against this proposal ?
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the ground s of a principle which I consider absolutely v ital with regard to obs erv ance of the Trea ti es, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam
Madam President, until now we belie ved that the European Union was , according to the Treaty of R ome and the Treaty of Par is found ing the European Comm un ities, and sub sequ ently the Union, an as soci ation of free , independ ent, so ver e ign states
E ven though many develop ments c ast doubt on this, we did believe , in sp ite of every th ing, that this was the case and, more recent ly, reference was made , al b e it h alf - h ear ted ly, to the principle of subsidiarity
We ll , p at ent ly, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are reques ting and as the Conference of President s is reques ting , on the basis of R ule 5 0 , we shall then be open ing up a fear s ome b re ach in the principle of the freedom and so ver e ign ty of the national states and the free cons titution of democratic ally elect ed government s, en abl ing some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to cla im the right to inter f ere in the form ation of a government even though it has ass um ed power on the basis of free , reg ular , peace ful and democratic ele ctions within a Member State
If you ra tif y
Mr Go ll n is ch , ex cu se me , you have one min ute . I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the R ul es of Pro ced ure are obs er ved
Madam President, I thought I had three min utes
Do for g ive me
If you ra tif y this development, then you are ra tif ying the development of the Union into a bod y which vi ol ates the so ver e ign ty and the freedom of the Member States, and we should then have no op tion but to with d ra w from such a Union
We have he ard one speak er in favour and one against
I shall now , therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote
( P ar liament g ave its ass ent )
This debate is therefore add ed at the top of the order of business
T O P I C AL A N D U R G E NT D E BA T E
The next item is the debate on top ical and urg ent subject s of major importance
T al ks in Austria on form ing a government
The next item is the debate on the t al ks in Austria on form ing a government
I shall immedi ately give the f lo or to Mr S e i x as d a C ost a, President -in - O ffice of the Council
Madam President, President of the Commission, President -in - O ffice of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Social ists h op es that this debate will s end three m ess ag es to the European public
Let it be not ed that we are completely un ited on all three count s
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for , and our solidarity with , the statement of the Presidency -in - O ffice of the Council and the 1 4 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values , and not just the political force , which we have all bu il t together
In any event , these common values are in complete opp o sition to those held by the party i ron ic ally know n as the Austrian F reedom Party
The Europe we are build ing is b or n of the b it ter experi ences we have all su ffer ed, and the Social ist Group con d em n s the ins ult s which have been direct ed at the President of the French Rep ublic and the B el g ian Government , but also at the Social ist s, who are European citizens as well , because , at the mom ent, the Austrian Social ists are being des c rib ed as tra it ors to their country
I will say one th ing. For many years I was a tra itor to my country ; at least that was G ener al Fr an c o ' s view
President G ut er res was also a tra itor in S al a z ar ' s e y es, and that is something that I believe should also be st ated and def end ed by the P P E - D E
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has act ed as a gu ard ian of the Trea ties
However, I would remind him that, during his in au g ural debate , he des c rib ed the Commission as a European government
A government must have more n erve and more c oura ge
That is what I am ask ing President Prodi for at this moment
(A pp la use )
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr F is ch l er, and given that we have he ard contra d ict ory comment s, dep ending on the trans l ation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the res ign ation of Mr F is ch l er, I would be very gr ate ful if this point could be cl ar if ied in this House
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to s end a very clear m ess age to the Austrian people
This is an appe al to the majority of Austri ans who have not voted for Ha id er, who have voted for the clearly democratic op tion s, comm itted to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Sch ü s sel may have been Minister for Fin ance, but Ch ance ll or V r an it z k y also contrib ut ed to Austria ' s integration process
We should not be so politic ally par tis an
The ac ces sion of Austria to the Community was a joint v ent ure
We all to ok part in it, not just one group
Therefore , Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our oblig ation to ask the Austri ans to recon sider and ref lect , because this type of m en ace , which we have su ffer ed before in Europe, may not only harm Austri a, but it may also sp read , and I say this bear ing hist ory in mind
Therefore , ap art from the ap olog y which Mr Sch ü s sel has made , offer ing us all kind s of guarant e es, as did Ch am ber l ain and D al ad i er in 1 9 3 8 in M un ich , I would like to know whether the P P E intend s to implement measures in relation to the Austrian Pe ople ' s Par t y, if it goes a he ad with this m ad project
Th ird ly, if we do not stand up to this un n at ural all i ance, I can ass ure you that we can for get the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because , if we were C z ech s, S lo ven es or H un g ar ian s, what would we say, fa ced with a ne igh bour who jud g es us on ra cial ground s and does not want us to enter ?
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politic s to comm ence
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our oblig ation to appe al to the Austrian people to serious ly recon sider this completely c ra z y op tion
(A pp la use from the P S E Group )
Madam President, my group wel com es this debate because it is a def ining moment
This is the first time in the hist ory of the modern European project that we stand at the th res ho ld of see ing the main st ream ing of a party of the extre me right
That is de ep ly dist ur b ing
The F P Ö cont end s that if one read s their l iter at ure and their programme, there is much in it that one could share
That may be , but let me place on the rec ord today a long and difficult experience which we Li beral Dem ocrat s had with the Austrian F P Ö in our Li beral Intern ational fam ily
As ear ly as 1 9 8 6 , we had cause to believe that Mr J ö r g Haider was not a man whose principles or at tit ud es were cons ist ent with dec ency and modern li beral ism
In No ve mber of 199 1 , after a long internal debate in Li beral Intern ational and many vis it s to V i en n a to discuss issues , we su sp end ed the F P Ö from members hip and in J u ly 199 3 we ex pe ll ed them
We ex pe ll ed them then and we continue to reject what Mr Haider stand s for now
Let me share what we le arn ed in that long experience
There were many in our r an ks who said " read the text "
There were many more in our r an ks who said " read the sub te xt " , " look at the context "
W ord s in politic s can be inc end i ary , can be inf la m m ator y, or can be con cili atory
We found that Mr J ö r g Ha id er, as a words m ith , has been a v o ice for r ac ism and for xenophob ia
He is a man who play s on fear and who has exp lo ited v ul ner ability
That is why this debate is important - to put down a mark er that when you main st ream extre m ism, something prof ound is happen ing in Europe today
(A pp la use )
I ha st en to add that our qu ar re l is not with the Austrian people
We respect the rights of the Austrian people to their own democratic process
We def end the rights and cons titutional pr er og atives of the Austrian people , but we here in the European Parliament have the d ut y to rec all our fundamental values as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty - the values of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights
E ver y right - th ink ing person in this House belie ves that these are un i vers al and indi v is ible without regard to col our , cl ass or cre ed
We must promote and def end those right s, all the while saying to the people of Austria : our qu ar re l is not with you
I wish to say with regard to the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it
It may not be an ide al initiative in terms of its structure but we accept Mr President -in - O ffic e, that it is ro oted in ide al ism and for that reason we are inc l ined to support it
I share with President Prodi a pre ference for the Community m eth od and we must look at Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty
Article 7 t al ks about the possibility of su sp ension in the event of serious or pers ist ent b re ach es of our fundamental values
We must find a way as institutions to b ench mark and give mean ing to this so that it has a reality and a sub st ance
Th en we can work together by the Community m eth od to ro ot out this can c er within our m id st
I want to say Mad a me President some words to Mr Sch ü s sel
Mr Sch ü s sel is a man with an hon oura ble rec ord in European politic s
He now intend s to r ide into government on the back of a political t ig er
Mr Sch ü s sel - you are ass um ing a very seri ou s, person al , national and European responsibility
That responsibility , which you Mr Sch ü s sel now take on , is to respect the let ter and the spirit of the European Trea ties
Finally, Mad a me President, this is a debate which to uch es on the hear t of our democratic values and institutions and call s to mind that the pr ice of li ber ty is e tern al v ig il ance
On this contin ent, of all pla ces, with the experience of h ate ful r ac ism that we have su ffer ed from in the past and at such great cost , we have to ins ist that today ' s debate is not about inter ference with the so ver e ign rights of a State
It is a do gg ed ins ist ence by the democratic ally elect ed part of the institutions of this Union that we will not as European s count en ance t ur ning the cl ock back
( L ou d app la use )
Madam President, in my group ' s opinion, the European Union today fa ces a political and e th ical challenge which is without pre ced ent since the cre ation of the Union
The European Union has certainly previous ly know n situ ations where there were people in a Member State government whose ide as and actions were in contra dic tion to the guid ing values of the Union
However, with Haider and his m en, we would see the extre me right , open ly r ac ist , anti - S em i tic and xenophob ic , prom oted to the r ank of co - r ul er of our Community
Go ing al ong with such a pro s pect would be t ant am ount to t es tif y ing, al b e it un w ill ing ly, to the respect ability of a political force which is not respect able. It would mean making the unacceptable common p la ce on the sc al e of Europe as a whole , it would mean making non s en se of the European institutions ' so le m n pro c la m ations on the fundamental values which un ite us and which we demand , right ly so , of applic ants for members hip
This is why we support the spirit of the statement made by the presid ency and the 1 4 Member States, as well as that of the President of the European Parliament, in so f ar as , un li ke the lack l ust re and amb ig u ous statement made by the Commission, it aim s to make people get the measure of the dang er and to pro vo ke a response
Of course, there can be no question of cas ting opp ro b ri um upon the people of Austria
An y action which can be taken must , in our opinion, s erve the two f o ld function of pro s c rib ing Haider without , however, is ol ating Austrian soci ety
Dem ocrat s in this country now need our support more than ever
The great j o ining of for ces in prot est in V i en n a on 12 No ve mber last year must now under go develop ments su ited to the new situation
We must have dialogue with them and j o in for ces with them , stand at their s ide in order to offer the people of Austria some al tern ative pro s pect s
Finally, we must ask ourselves : how did we come to be in this position ?
C ertain ly, in the first inst ance, as far as Austrian political lead ers are concerned, it is a matter of answer ing this exist ential question for the future of democracy , st ar ting with those who have just taken the in ordin ate risk of gi ving the extre me right a bo ost
But , be y ond that, no one , including the European Union, can , in our opinion, be ex emp ted from ask ing themselves what ground s there are for per mit ting an un s c ru pul ous dem ag ogue to exp lo it the f r ust r ations and fear s gener ated by policies in which too many sect ors of the population are dis reg ard ed
This debate is now before us, but each and every one of us, m al e and f em al e, is going to ass u me their respon sib ili ties without delay
(A pp la use )
Madam President, we could have been deb ating the need to re in for ce the found ing principles of the Union, so that we can up ho ld them together . In st ead , we have been for ced to debate the form al , substan ti al e r r ors that have been made in the last few day s
We are a st on ish ed by the political na ive ty of people who , with thought less words, have b ol ster ed Mr Haider ' s position in Austria and made the Union look r id ic ul ou s, r id ing r ough s h od over Article 7 of the Treaty by ann oun cing un con s titutional measures
We have never before seen such seri ou s, cl um s y inter ference in the internal affair s of a Member State
Of course, we cannot vi ol ate the found ing values of Europe, and in this regard , the It al ian P ri me Minister st ated that these principles are included in a treat y : he mentioned the Treaty of C op en h ag en, which I , like you, have never he ard of because it does not exist
M ay b e he was refer ring to the Treaty of Amsterdam , Article 6 of which list s certain principles and Article 7 certain procedure s, in order to establish that a Member State is serious ly and continu ous ly vi ol ating the principles refer red to in Article 6
However, up t ill now , Austria has comm itted no serious or pers ist ent vi ol ation
A p art from am oun ting to inter ference , the statement by the Presidency is discri min atory because it author ises the p en al isation of a population and d en ies these people their right to ch o ose who to vote for
No political cohesion has so far come about , not even in the fight against organ ised crime , or in def ence of the vic ti ms of g en o ci de ; we do not have a currency that is even rem ote ly st able or an economy which really does combat unemployment and po ver ty ; but it only to ok one min ute of i con oc l as tic f ur y to d est ro y the Union' s cre di bility
S an ctions can be imp osed after the Trea ties have been vi ol at ed, but cannot be appli ed if a democratic ally elect ed party enter s government
O ther wise , how will we deal with Comm un ist countries which ret urn to Comm un ism : will we th row them out of the Union too if Comm un ists enter into government , or will St al in ' s g rand ch ild r en be for g i ven for every thing ?
(A pp la use from the right ) It is v ia di p l om ac y, pers u asion , know ledge , and solidarity , and not with threat s or v ia anti - con s titutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles
B il ater al relations involve the States, so the 1 4 do not come into this
This is r id ing r ough s h od over the European institutions in order to def end political way s of think ing, with an inc om pe t ence worth y of par ties which have just em erg ed from total it ar ian reg im es. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic tra ditions
So many things set us ap art from Mr Haider - as we have often wr itt en - including his cla im to the completely It al ian Al t o A di ge region . However, we already k ne w this
However, today we are concerned to le arn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turn ed their back s on the Union' s democratic role
We support leg ality and democracy as expressed by the pe op l es, and favour up ho ld ing national so ver e ign ty as long as this does not vi ol ate the principles of the Treaty or human rights
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have st ar ted the process of b re aking up the Union
This is what has come of r us hing he ad l ong into enlargement and not clearly def ining r ol es and tas ks
We have bu il t a Europe with an un st able market , not a Europe with princip l es, rights and politic s
And these are the consequ ences !
Therefore , we can but call on the Commission to continue to show rest ra int and p ra ise those who are working to saf eg uard the independ ence and so ver e ign ty of the Austrian people , there b y ens uring that this people re tain s its freedom s and maintain s good relations with other pe op les
Madam President, today we have an app oint ment with h y p oc ris y. H ere we have a Council which has man aged to f l out the treat y and employ a m eth od completely un re l ated to Artic les 6 and 7 which make it possible to con d em n a State in the event of a serious and pers ist ent b re ach
In the event there is absolutely no serious and pers ist ent b re ach in Austria
There are risk s, as we are all aware , but in the event there is absolutely no serious and pers ist ent b re ach
If we were to apply the criteria of Artic les 6 and 7 or the C op en h ag en criteria to the European Union, then , most certain ly, this European Union could not become a member , although the countries of East ern Europe are required to meet them
And if we were to speak of serious and pers ist ent b re ach es, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as It aly and Fr ance, first and third , res pe ctive ly, in the list of countries con d em n ed by the Council of Europe and the St r as bour g cour t
We could mention , my B el g ian f ri end s, B el g ium and the D ut rou x case, the do z ens upon do z ens of ch ild r en k id n app ed, to r t ure d , r ap ed and m ur der ed by lead ing person al ities in this country , where in qu i ri es are b og ged down , making no he ad way
We could , if one third of the Members of Parliament so request ed, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter
We could ask ourselves why the Austri ans are re jec ting 1 0 years, 1 3 years of party politic s which has made one country - Austria - cor ru p t and r ot ten , just as it is now cor ru p ting countries such as It al y, B el g ium and other European Union Member States
We might well w on der why 7 6 % of B el g ian citizens have no fa ith in the justice system in their country or why 5 6 % of French citizens have no confidence in their country ' s system of justice , and 5 3 % of It al ian citizens have absolutely no confidence in It al ian justice
( T he President c ut the speak er off )
Mad a me President, my group , the E D D , and especially my part y, are very concerned by this debate
We cannot , and we do not, support in any way the s enti ments and politic s of H er r Haider and we dep l ore his refer ences to the Th ird R e ich
We also , however, dep l ore the fact that your Parliament should consider inter fer ing in the policies of an elect ed government of any country , especially one which is part of the European Union
My party at home are certainly not r ac ist s, but we do not accept the r ule or inter ference of the European Union very well
A re you going to inter f ere with G reat B rit ain ' s Parliament if we are elect ed ?
Mad a me President, the people of Austria have sp ok en by ele c ting H er r Haider to their Parliament
I believe they g ave him 2 8 % of the vote so there is going to be a co al ition government
Y our Parliament, may I suggest , Mad a me President, should w a it to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country
Th en, and only then , might you consider if human rights are affect ed
Y our Parliament may consider measures appropriate to c oun ter that situation and then , Mad a me President and only then , may your Parliament consider inter fer ing in the cons titutional affair s of a country of the European Union
Madam President, as a represent ative of the F reedom Par t y, I respect the concerns some of my fe llow M E P s have with regard to the democratic develop ments in Austria
My re action may come as a sur pr ise when I say that I person ally am at a l os s as to the he ight en ed sen si tiv ity disp lay ed towards Austria in matters of respect for human right s, having a sense of responsibility for one ' s own past , and the st ability of democracy
Austria must take the responsibility on its own should ers for the often d ub ious im age other countries t end to have of it, right ly or wr ong ly
The ref us al of our government , down through the years, to ac know ledge our comp lic ity in the h or r ors of the Second W or ld W ar , together with their ref us al to proper ly comp ens ate the J e w ish vic ti ms and those for ced into hard l ab our , have done a great deal to b ol ster this ne g ative im age
This F P Ö has now enter ed into a co al ition with the Ö V P , due to the out come of ele ctions held on 3 O ct o ber 1999 , when the previous government was voted out of offic e
This is the citizen of a state ' s pr er og ative , for it is the found ing principle of a democracy
When the t al ks between the S P Ö and Ö V P bro ke down , the Social ists attemp ted to form a min ority government and asked the F P Ö for their support
We were offer ed three min ister ial post s - you can read it for your self in the new sp ap ers - the very party that is being d en oun ced as f as c istic here !
When we su d den ly ref us ed this offer , an inf la m m atory and r ab ble - r ous ing prop ag and a c amp a ign be gan that is be y ond our compreh ension to this day
The F P Ö party is established in Austria ' s political l and s c a pe
The he ad of the government of one of the n ine pro v in ces be l ong s to this party and it is involved in all the other pro v in cial governments
What many Austri ans are w on der ing today is why their democratic decision has su d den ly been inter p re ted as an exp ression of a f as c istic c ast of mind , and why the c amp a ign did not begin until the F reedom Party reject ed the support of a min ority government comp ris ing the S P Ö ?
There is pre j ud ice at work here , which - without going into our programme - is redu cing the d ark est h our of European hist ory to a political spe ct ac le
I am f ill ed with dis g ust when certain of our opp on ents get m ile age out of the million s of de ath s that to ok place in the g as ch am ber s of the concentr ation c amp s as ch e ap prop ag and a, as , for example, the It al ian M E P B er tin ot ti did yesterday on It al ian T V when he acc us ed Mr Haider of d en ying the h ol oc a ust
S h a me on you Mr B er tin ot ti !
You might have run out of political argu ments but that does not give you the right to use those who were m ur der ed as ch e ap prop ag and a
D en oun cing a democratic ally elect ed poli ti ci an as a N a z i does not make you an anti -f as c ist !
On the cont r ary , you are d er id ing the true vic ti ms of N ational Social ism and play ing down what the f as c ist d ict at ors did
Y our beh av i our st em s from your own pre j ud ic es, you are disp ens ing with any form of political debate and you are disp lay ing precisely the kind of beh av i our you cla im to opp ose
The att ack s against Austria ' s new government and the attemp ts to ex er t political inf lu ence in a Member State are an ins ult to the Austrian people
That is why we are inde b ted to the Commission for taking a st ance that s ep ar ates it from the rest
The new co al ition agreement is about reform ing a democracy , the rights of the opp o sition , commitment to comp ens ating those for ced into hard l ab our
( T he President c ut the speak er off )
Madam President, to begin with , I would like to make one thing ab und ant ly clear : Austria is not in dang er of experi en cing a res ur g ence of a one - p ar ty system or of a total it ar ian system of right - w ing pers u asion
Austria is a st able democracy ; one in which human rights and fundamental freedom s are guarant e ed under the cons titution and are aff ord ed the protection of an independent judic i ary
Austria is a c os m op ol it an country and xenophob ia and discri mination have no place there
There is nothing un us ual about what is happen ing in Austria : there has been a change over of power following democratic ele ction s, in consequ ence of which an old system was voted out and a st able parliament ary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reform s was s ought and found
There will be a function ing majority and like wise a function ing opp o sition
The Austrian Pe ople ' s Par t y, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has cons ist ently sp ok en up for the integration of my country into the EU and feel s de ep ly att ach ed to the community of values that is the European Union, and like wise its basic political principles of de ep ening and enlargement
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also app re ci ate the concerns that are being v o ic ed in many of our Member States as to the way a he ad for Austria
Our understand ing sp r ings from the know ledge that our hist ory of the recent past has be q ue ath ed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present
Our country was not just the first vic tim of the H it ler d ict at ors hip , many people were per pe t rat ors too , although I ref ute any sugg es tion of colle ctive gu il t
The Ö V P play ed no small part in help ing Austria find its way into the European Union
My country ' s place is not outside the European Union but in it
, with all the rights and commit ments that this ent ail s !
An y future government must therefore be jud ged according to the values and principles it prof ess es to in its man if est o, and not according to the pre j ud ge ments put about both by political ad vers ar ies and the international medi a
A dec la red belie f in human right s, democracy and the r ule of law , in an hon est re app ra is al of Austria ' s role in the past , in pass ing on information on the g ra ves t crime against human ity in the 2 0 th cent ur y, the h ol oc a ust , will also be ref lect ed in the fundamental accord under ly ing a future co al ition government between the Ö V P and F P Ö
My party can be re li ed upon to see to it that my country hold s firm to the course of European politic s and contin ues to be ro oted in the European community of values !
(A pp la use )
Madam President, Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, Rep resent atives of the Commission, it is a b la ck day for Austria and for Europe
N ot even Mr S ich ro v s k y ' s we b of li es or Mrs St en z el ' s words of appe ase ment can do any thing to change that
For the day has d a wn ed : two ir res pon sible poli ti ci an s, consum ed with a l ust for power , are se ll ing Austria ' s im age , political role , and to some extent even its economic interest s, down the r i ver !
(A pp la use , h ec k ling )
They are tra d ing this in for a he ad of government ' s position and for members hip of a government
They are just as prepared to take on bo ard the fact that Austria will go from being a re ver ed country to a rev il ed one , as they are its threat en ed is ol ation and th us to some extent that of its citizens
I believe - as do many who for years have c amp a ign ed against Haider and his b rand of politic s, and especially my colleagues in the Social Dem ocra tic de leg ation in this Ch am ber - that the various measures ann oun ced by the international community , in so f ar as they do not have any bear ing on the government and its representatives , are g ra ve and also in app ro pri ate
However, my critic ism - and I free ly ad mit this - my r age , is direct ed exc lu sive ly against those who have pro v ok ed these re ac tions and continue to do so , M ess r s Sch ü s sel and Haider and their parti es,
and that includ es their representatives in this Parliament
Mr P o et ter ing, it is inter es ting to note that you are in al most as difficult a position as I am , al b e it for different reason s, for you are having to def end something that goes against your conv ic tions
You are having to def end a certain Mr Sch ü s sel , you are having to cons ort with Sch ü s sel as he is today and who , as I understand it, was rec ently to ld not to come to the representatives of the Ch ris ti an Dem ocra tic party ' s su m mit meeting
The argu ment that Mr P o et ter ing him self used has come into play , i.e. that it would only be possible to de pri ve Haider of his my s ti q ue if he were to be integr ated into the political system
However, in my view, he will be no more able or will ing to be integr ated into this, into our political system , and into the Europe of today, than any other extre me right - w ing movement
An y one who fe ed s on pre j ud ice towards fore ign ers and e th n ic min or ities and gi ves suc c our to these pre j ud ic es, whose programme fe at ures par o ch ial ism and anti - li beral ism, who disp lay s l ou tis h beh av i our and ar ro g ance in their international rel ations, and who has never yet dist an ced themselves clearly and une qu iv oc ally from N ational Social ism, has ne ither the intention n or inc lin ation to integr ate !
(A pp la use )
This hist or ic we ight of gu il t fall s on the should ers of the Con s erv atives for having cons ort ed with the w ol f of their own free will and w a iting to be dev ou red
That is how the w ol f - al b e it on account of the s el f- s ac ri fic e of the Ö V P - is sustain ed rather than k ep t in chec k
I understand that Europe and the civil ised world want s to have as little as possible to do with such a government
However, by the same to k en, there is another Austri a, the one where u mp t een th ous and people demonstr ated against the F P Ö having any involve ment in government , and who will continue to demonstr ate against this government
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria !
(A pp la use )
The more power ful this Europe bec om es and the more v ig il ant it is towards author it ar ian t end en ci es in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in st ri k ing at the ro ot s of right - w ing extre m ism
For Europe is and will remain the most pot ent guarantee we have against xenophob ia and dem ag og y, or even against a re la p se into b ar b ar ism
P le ase support the Austrian people against this government !
(A pp la use )
Madam President, this is an hist or ic mom ent, as it is now , at last , quite clear to us all that the European Union has g ra du ally develop ed into a community of values
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being j o ined by a party which, as is know n , does not respect all these values
I would also like to say that the position of the f ourt een states e man ating from the Council was jus tif i ed, as in a way this is also a matter of the comp o sition of the government of the European Union, mean ing this is also a matter for the Council and not mere ly an internal affair of Austria ' s
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work be g un to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever . It is more important than ever that respect for , and non- v i ol ation of , human values and the rights of min or ities, including the rights of all those who live within the ter rit ory of the European Union, form an essential comp on ent in the r ule of law principle of the EU , and, for this reason , the Ch arter of Fund amental Right s must be made leg ally b ind ing
It must not be allow ed to remain a mere dec l ar ation
As important is the fact that Austria ' s for ces of democracy should be given support , as n one of us wishes to is ol ate the country
We know that most Austri ans respect these values
They have also sh own how they feel : not all the demonstr ations have taken place outside Austria
D ou b t less there are also a lot of prot est v ot ers on the sc ene that have want ed a change in Austrian policy for a long time
I believe Parliament should support these for ces of democracy
I also appe al to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the pos sib ili ties for form ing a government made up of democratic for ces
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the at tit ud e that the lead er of our group , Fr an c is W ur t z , remind ed us of just now
I welcome the state ments by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 1 4 countries which have reject ed official cont act with an Austrian Government that includ es J ö r g Haider ' s party
The fact that we are stress ing this is all the more important because , as you know , we ess enti ally dis ag ree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social polic ies, its democratic de fic it and the Member States ' involve ment in the ter ri ble w ar in the B alk ans
Our n orm al dis ag ree ment further emphas ises our app re ci ation today : this is ext ra ordin ary because the dang er of a res ur g ence of an ir r ational , ne o - n a z i e lement in Europe is ext ra ordin ary
This dang er does not concern Austri a, it concerns Europe
We are talking about us, not Austria
We know the social caus es which contrib ute , al ong with unemployment and inst ability , to f ue ll ing t end en ci es towards this ; we know the acc om p an ying cultural caus es - xenophob i a, r ac ism - but with the in ability and un w ill ing ness of these extre me right - w ing groups to set t le account s with na z ism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an exp lo sive m i xt ure being creat ed in Europe
N ot only the Al p ine region , but all our countries are involved : the conditions are being creat ed where b y democracy and European civil isation may once again come under threat
The position taken by the presid ency has sh own that it is aware of this tra ged y for civil isation
Europe is show ing that it has not for g ot ten A us ch w it z ; Europe is coming face to face with the su ffer ing of the past
N ow , though , it should follow through with its action s, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obs c ure and weak on this, making the value of the presid ency ' s position even more app ar ent
This is the change we must imp ose on the Commission' s action
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and so ver e ign ty of pe op l es, which opp os es f as c ism, na z ism or commun ism, both new and old , and despite all the previous speak ers talking about the so ver e ign ty of the Austrian people , we are today w it ness ing this so ver e ign ty being d en ied by Parliament
In the man if est o of the Austrian Dem ocra tic F reedom Par t y, there is nothing to jus tif y the acc us ations that it is att ack ing the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human right s, fundamental freedom s or the r ule of law , ens h r ined in Article 6 of the Trea ties
I would , however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President -in - O ffic e, who has been so cri tical of Austri a, has rec ently con si gn ed the in h ab it ants of M ac a o to the so ver e ign r ule of the Pe ople ' s Dem ocra tic Rep ublic of Ch in a
P er h ap s, in order to strengthen the Union' s democracy , it would now be appropriate to is ol ate Austria and criminal ise a party that was democratic ally elect ed by the Austrian citizen s, while bring ing Turke y and its " G re y W ol ves " into Europe
Madam President, we are deb ating an extremely serious issue
We are deb ating nothing less than the pres ence in a Member State ' s government of a political force whose do ct r ine and principles are inc om p a ti ble with the con cept ual and mor al bas es of the Union ens h r ined in its found ing Trea ties
A simp le read ing of ch ap ter 4 , ar tic le 1 of the Austrian F reedom Party ' s man if est o is enough to make any democratic cons ci ence sh ud der
The view that e th n ic ity is the def ining fact or of a n ation and the cla im that one e th n ic group has sup eri ority over other s, as is wr itt en here , rev i ves old g h ost s of the cent ur y which we have just left behind , which some hist or i ans have des c rib ed as the cent ur y of h or r ors ; h or r ors which the unacceptable ph il os oph y behind Mr Haider ' s man if est o has sti r red up once again , to our am a z e ment
Of course Austria is a so ver e ign n ation and of course we must respect the principle of non- in ter ference in the internal affair s of a Member State
However, that is not the problem
The question is whether the Union can remain indi ffer ent to the form ation of a government in a Member State which includ es such a party
Our answer to this crucial question is no
Le a ving a side strategic and t ac tical consider ations, le a ving a side possible ex on er ations based on other people ' s beh av i our and above and be y ond party and elect or al interest s, the S p anish de leg ation of the Pe ople ' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the S p anish Pe ople ' s Party and the S p anish Government , clearly express es its full agreement with the statement of 3 1 J an u ary by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council. We agree with its sub st ance, its t one and its scope
(A pp la use )
K on ra d A den au er once said - and he k ne w what he was saying - that the sure st way to pa ci f y a t ig er was to allow it to de vour you
H ist ory is a comp end ium of event s which could have been avoid ed
Therefore , Madam President, the Union and the As se mb ly must s end an une qu iv oc al m ess age , re jec ting of the t ig er of int ol er ance, xenophob ia and total it ar ian ism, so as not to add one more m ist ake to the long list of ab dic ations, r en un ci ations and opportun ism which mark Europe ' s past and for which we have pa id such a he av y pr ice
( L ou d app la use )
Madam President, the European Union was bu il t upon the idea ' n ever again ' , mean ing never again do we want to see xenophob i a, concentr ation c amp s, anti - S em iti s m , he ight en ed national ism or w ar
The one and only signific ance of the European Union is the will to trans c end the at ro ci ous hist ory of the tw enti eth cent ur y which g ave the c ou p de gr â ce to any ide al of human ism within the hear t of Europe, and which is still high ly top ical today
It is not true to say that, when a government for ms an all i ance with ne o - F as c ists some wh ere in Europe, this is mere ly a question of national so ver e ign ty
For this Union of our s is not a group ing of ne igh bour ing n ation states who are simply coming to m ut ual ar r ange ments to improve their colle ctive circ um stan ces
It is a Community that is des tin ed to exist , in which, when the main thing is under threat , when values are under threat , all dem ocrat s must b end over back wards to find solution s to ensure that the m ist akes of the past are never made again
Let us le arn the less ons of the past
In the th ir ti es, when A d ol f H it ler was democratic ally elect ed, although with a min ority , many people thought that it was not as b ad as all that and, Mr P o et ter ing, in Fr ance, a number of m en and women , on the right w ing but perhaps of other political pers u asion s too , thought , ' B et ter H it ler in France than the Fr on t P op ul a ire . '
They put their own p et ty s qu ab b les first , and the rest is hist ory
We must make a r ap id , strong and un ited response
I would have li k ed to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr P o et ter ing. We are well aware that he is very em b ar r ass ed today at the d ir ty deal that government has done in form ing such an all i ance
So our response must be r ap id and strong
Of course, the Treaty provid es us with a b ar ri er when things become int ol er able ; I was al most going to say ' ir re p ar able '
H ist ory has t au ght us that F as c ists start to b low h ot and co ld : using he ated words first , in popul ist , xenophob ic speech es, and then co ol words in order to make themselves accept able to institutions and to inf il t r ate them g ra du ally, po is on ing them , until the day they start to take action
And when that day com es, it is too l ate
So our Treaty has made provision for b ar ri ers for the time when it is too l ate, but we are not at that point : today we have to take step s to ensure that we do not get to that point
We must therefore find a political solution
I support the Council proposals in this, while dep l or ing a certain lack of strength , a certain sp in el ess n ess, on the part of the Commission which will , however, have to be v ig il ant on a day -b y - day basis , with deter mination over time, since F as c ists count on the sp in el ess ness of democracy , they count on time to we ar us down and they hope to imp ose their views in the end
Our response must be r ap id
If today we do not sta un ch ly support the Council, then hist ory will jud ge us, saying that we achie ved the political equ i val ent of the M un ich Ag ree ment
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austri a, the will of the large majority of the people is being respect ed and that this form ation of government constit ut es, in my e y es, a h uge v ict ory for democracy
Let there be no doubt about it : we dec line with than ks a Europe which develop s into a kind of " b ig bro ther " and which keep s w at ch over left - w ing political correct ness in one Member State or another in a St al in ist way and using St al in ist m eth od s
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not rece ive any less ons from any b od y and certainly not from a B el g ian Government that em b ra ces cor ru p t par ties finan ced by ar ms deal ers and that app oint ed the lead er of such a cor ru p t part y, which was con d em n ed by the cour t , to the post of European Commissioner
T od ay , we thank the Austrian people for this democratic t ri u mp h which is important to all n ations within Europe and to any one who feel s particularly strong ly about freedom and freedom of speech
Madam President, this debate was open ed by Mr D a C ost a, who mere ly conf ir ms that the EU presid ency is tr ying to inf lu ence the comp o sition of a government of one of the Member States
This debate , and the back g round to it, re in for ced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are d om in ated by Social ists
My de leg ation of 3 7 Con s erv ative and Union ist Members from the United K ing d om reject absolutely the under ly ing ph il os oph y, programme and t one of Austria ' s F reedom Party
We share the w id es p read out ra ge at its at tit ud e to hist or y, in particular W or ld W ar II , but also its policies on enlargement , on immig r ation, on ra ce and its at tit ud e to the European Union itself
We were also out ra g ed, however, at the to ler ance of the left for the ty r ann y, the terr or and the ex cess es of the form er U S S R
E ven today, sure ly it is high time for the Party of European Social ists to b re ak their f rat ern al link s with Ch in a ' s Comm un ist Party
N ot a word was said by these same EU governments about co al ition governments invol ving fe llow - t ra ve ll ing commun ists in French or It al ian government s, or in German state government s, or even the B ri tis h government ' s will ing ness to promote those with terr or ist as soci ations as min ister s in N ort her n Ireland today
This , Madam President, is the h y p oc ris y of the left
So we con d em n that h y p oc ris y and the dou ble standard s, especially of the B ri tis h government and the other large ly social ist he ad s of EU governments and include that of the United States
We should recogn ise , however, that the democratic process some tim es produ ces un com fort able results
This requ i res action to address the under ly ing caus es, including an exam in ation of the elect or al process itself
That should be our task , not political post uring
Madam President, Rep resent ative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ag o, the b ig international H ol oc a ust Conference end ed in St ock h ol m
It s aim was to combat the for get ful ness and the e v il in today ' s soci ety which takes the form of xenophob ia and ne o - n a z ism
It would be an ins ult to the idea behind this con ference and to the whole of the international community to inv ite , at this time, into the institutions of the EU , a xenophob ic party which f li r ts with N a z i ide as
Secondly, I want to say that we must be cons ist ent in our own beh av i our and in our e val u ations
We demand of the c and id ate States and of the countries with which the EU cooper ates under the L om é Ag ree ment that they should respect human rights and show to ler ance towards their ne igh bour s
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned
That is why we are re ac ting against this carry - on in Austria
It is not accept able to continue as if nothing had happen ed
We are at a w at ers h ed in the hist ory of the European Union
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values , something which we take serious ly. S omething has happen ed
The European Union is in the process of find ing its s ou l and get ting some steel in its sp ine
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day . It is the day of the first debate of European political life
And this is not p ure ch ance
I feel that today ' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institution s, with Austria or Mr Haider ' s party
It is the meeting of Europe with itself , with its ra is on d ' ê t re , with the reason s why we are here in this Ch am ber
This Ch am ber was not made for good s, it was not made for money
This Ch am ber , and the European institution s, were build to up ho ld values , mor ality and a certain spirit
In the tw enti eth cent ur y, we have had experience of the fact that democra ci es can find themselves at risk , and mor ality , values and the spirit which I mentioned can be m ort ally affect ed by v ir us es which have just one na me : national ist g l or ific ation, popul ism and the con cept of ra cial sup eri ority
The fact is that it is enough to read the man if est o of Mr Haider ' s part y, the F P Ö , to find national ist g l or ific ation, popul ism and ra cial sup eri ority in every ch ap ter
R ead ing only one s ent ence which my f ri end , Mr V id al - Q u ad r as , has previous ly mention ed, " T he n ation is def ined by its loc ation, culture and ra ce , loc ally, e th n ic ally and cult ur ally . "
We ll , we cannot accept such state ments
If Europe has any mean ing, and - my f ri end s will par d on me tell ing them - if Ch ris ti an democracy has any mean ing, if the hist ory of Ch ris ti an democracy has any mean ing, then it must dec la re itself r ad ic ally opp osed to the state ments made in this man if est o and, wh ate ver excellent reason s are given when ever hist ory s er ves the same dis h up again , must reject any agreement with this type of ide olog y and this type of organ isation
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay t rib ute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the c oura ge to say no , and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us cre d it , and in clear terms dec la re , without pre v ar ic ation, its opp o sition to and con d em n ation of im min ent event s in Austri a, rec all ing the statement made on the day of the M un ich Ag ree ment by a great French Ch ris ti an Dem ocrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no , then the best time to do so is right at the begin ning
(A pp la use )
Madam President, we the B el g ian Ch ris ti an Dem ocrat s are concerned as , for t un ately, are a great many other Members too
The co al ition which is being creat ed in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but u nd ou b ted ly has a European di men sion too
B ec ause what is it that un it es us in Europe ? S ure ly it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human right s, more than any thing
The Austrian F reedom Party lead er, Mr Ha id er, has repe ated ly rep ud i ated these values
He also rep ud i ates the basic for ms of di p l om atic po l it en ess
He is a dangerous man
The Ch ris ti an Dem ocra tic par ties in my country have made up their mind s a long time ag o and they s tic k to their decision to list en to the prot est s of extre me - ri ght v ot ers but never to negoti ate with extre me - ri ght lead ers
V al ues should take pre ced ence over power
We dep l ore , therefore, what is happen ing in Austria . In fact, we were sh ak en by it
We are extremely dis app oint ed. As a last res ort , we would ask the Ö V P to look into al tern atives
We keep remind ing them about Article 6 of the Treaty
We continue to fight against the t ri v ial isation of the extre me right
If , despite this, the co al ition goes a he ad , we would urge the Ö V P party members to ensure that the principles and values which under lie European integration are obs er ved in political programm es, both in word and de ed
Madam President, Austria aw a it s a he av y responsibility
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very large ly ag reed on re jec ting Mr Haider and his politic s, but it is equ ally clear that opinion di ff ers as to the most effective way of opp os ing this b rand of politic s
Ha ve you st o pp ed to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement deli ver ed by the Council Presidency last week end are having in Austria itself ?
Ha ve you st o pp ed to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation un f o ld s from now if we set ourselves up to pass jud ge ment on it here ?
Ha ve you st o pp ed to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fe llow M E P was to be fulf ill ed and ele ctions were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few day s ?
F rom all account s, this would only s erve to strengthen Haider
Wh o would want this to happen ?
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should t ack le this b rand of politic s ?
Europe is a community of law
Dem ocra cy , respect for human rights and r ule of law are among st the principles that we must up ho ld
One of the pre cept s of democracy is that we should not dis app ro ve of elect or al out com es but respect them , and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrian s, by v ir t ue of their political culture , voted as they did
It is for reason s of cons titution ality that the President -in - O ffice of the Council o u ght not to have made the statement he did , and in a man ner that goes against the Treaty
It would be politic ally a st ute not to is ol ate the Ö V P but to support it as an u nd en i ably democratic , cons titutional and well - know n European part y, so as to be equ ally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community , and that is why we must give the Ö V P our support in this difficult situ ation, and is ol ation would be al t og ether the wr ong line to take !
(A pp la use )
Madam President, they say, where I come from , ' it ' s three tim es for a We l s h man ' , and three tim es, as I think you will disc over in the course of that debate , I sign if ied my des ire to respon d very brief ly to what has been an excell ent, and on several occasion s, a mo ving debate
First of all, could I express my than ks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understand ing offer ed by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday
I must respon d also to the fact, of course, that there were refer ences during the debate - and I use some of the words employ ed - to the amb ig u ity , the comp la c ency and the fra g ility of the Commission' s opinion
I am d ut y - b ound to say to this House , there is no amb ig u ity or fra g ility or comp la c ency in the opinion offer ed, or indeed the action taken , by the Commission on this issue
We made exp lic it reference yesterday mor ning in our statement , as did the President this after n o on , to the fact that we share the concern demonstr ated by f ourt een Member States in their statement on Mon day
Secondly, we said, in very specific term s, that we will work close ly with all Member States in exam ining the situation as it develop s in Austria
Th ird ly, we express ed, in very exp lic it term s, that we will up ho ld without fear or favour the values and the provision s of Article 6 of the Treaty ; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ens uring that those values of li ber ty and democracy and fundamental freedom s are up he ld
There is no comp la c ency , no fra g ility and no amb ig u ity about any of that at all
And , when I say that the Commission to ok that view, I include my de ar colleag ue Fr an z F is ch l er, who is from Austria ; and who , once again , demonstr ated his integr ity and his independ ence as a Member of the European Commission, under o ath , in being part of that statement that we made yesterday mor ning
An y one , therefore, who inv it es Fr an z F is ch ler to his h ouse to some h ow account for the fact that his national ity is Austrian , should exam ine their own mo tives in the context of a debate , which has been necess arily sh ad ow ed by refer ences to xenophob ia and even more let h al e v il s in this world
I say that in f ri end s hip and hon our to my f ri end and colleag ue , Fr an z F is ch ler
C ould I also say, Madam President, that the understand ing of the presid ency , the Portuguese presid ency , for our position , was absolutely demonstr ated in the c le are st terms by Mr D a C ost a when he said, and I qu ote him , that ' P ortug al and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community m ach ine is not affect ed by the current situation '
That sure ly is in everyone ' s interests
In order to ensure that the Treaty is up he ld and that we sustain what was des c rib ed as the Community m ach ine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour
That is our d ut y
It is also a matter of conv ic tion
My final point is this. We understand the context of this essential debate
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become fam ili ar with H er r Haider ' s off ensive statement s, the xenophob ia of many of his policy ele ments and the strategy that he has develop ed of al tern ating ag g res sive state ments with ap olog ies, some tim es on suc ces sive day s
We understand that, and we rec all too the some tim es short and se le ctive m em ory that he has of N a z ism
And , when we rec all that, like many others on all s id es of this House , my and my colleagues ' ins tin ct s are nat ur ally ar ous ed
However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of ins tin ct
And that is why we ca me to the conclusion we reached yesterday mor ning
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to up ho ld the values and the law
With out fra g ility , without comp la c ency , without amb ig u ity , but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people
We will continue to do that with energy and with cons ist ency and as Mr C o x said in the debate , ' n ecess arily with ac ute v ig il ance '
I w on der , since Mr D a C ost a has been list ening to these rem ark s from the back of the Ch am ber , whether Mr K in n ock could confirm that the Commission support s the view exp lic it ly st ated by Mr D a C ost a today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the he ad s of government
Do es the Commission support the Council ?
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday mor ning that it not es the views expressed as a joint statement by f ourt een Member States and sh a res the concern that g ave r ise to that view, I think it can be taken for grant ed that since yesterday mor ning , as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue , it has had a view cons ist ent with that of f ourt een of the Member States
Thank you, Commissioner K in n ock
I think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expect ed of it
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen
The debate on top ical and urg ent subject s of major importance is cl osed
The vote will take place at 1 1 a . m. tomorrow
R ec our se to the precautionary principle
The next item is the Commission statement on rec our se to the precautionary principle
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be pres en ting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been wr itt en together with D a vid B y r ne and E r k k i Li i k an en
The precautionary principle is not a new con cept
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a r ange of policy areas, environmental , human , an im al and pl ant health ; and it is exp lic it ly mentioned in the environmental provision s of the E C Treaty since M a ast r ich t
It also appe ar s in a r ange of international text s, for example, the R i o D ec l ar ation and most rec ently the B i o - S a f ety Pro t oc ol
The ess ence of the precautionary principle is clear
It invol ves taking action in a given policy area when the sci ence is not clear , but where there are reason able ground s for concern that the potential ris ks are b ig enough to require action
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasing ly in the sp ot light in recent years
E vent s such as the B S E and di o x in crisis have sti m ul ated a grow ing public debate about the circ um stan ces in which precautionary action is jus tif ied and necessary
In view of this grow ing interest , the Commission therefore considered that it would be use ful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle
The basic aim of the communication is two f o ld
To explain in a clear and co her ent way how the Commission appli es, and intend s to app ly, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reason ed and co her ent principles
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understand ing of how to manage ris ks and to dis pe l fear s that the precautionary principle might be used in an ar b it r ary way or as a dis gu ised form of trade protection ism
The Commission' s st ar ting point in apply ing the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the field s of environmental , human , an im al and pl ant health
Of course, this objective cannot be used to jus tif y ir r ational or ar b it r ary measure s, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situ ations where the sci ence is un c lear
As such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the politic isation of sci ence, as some have al leg ed, it does take us to the cross ro ad s between sci ence and politic s
The initi al decision to apply the precautionary principle dep end s large ly on the level of protection s ought and the level of risk that decision -m ak ers are prepared to accept for soci ety
It is therefore political by nature
However, the measures that may sub sequ ently be taken must obvious ly comp ly with the general principles applic able to risk management and the guidelines for apply ing the precautionary principle are therefore the key e lement of the p aper
M e as ures taken must be prop or tion al to the ch os en level of protection - that is, we do not use the s ledge h am m er to c rac k a n ut
They must be non- d is c ri min atory in their applic ation, that is measures should not differ enti ate on the basis of g e o graph ical o ri gin
And they must be cons ist ent with sim ilar measures already taken
For example, if one product has been appro v ed, sim ilar product s should also be approved
M e as ures are based on an exam in ation of the potential benefit s and costs of action or lack of action ; that is, the measures should be cost - e ff ec tive and subject to review in the light of new scientific d at a and be clear about who is responsible for produ cing the scientific e vid ence necessary for a more compreh ensive risk assess ment , that is the b ur den of pro o f
All these ele ments have to apply c um ul ative ly
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a w ide r ange of measure s, which can be taken in apply ing the precautionary principle . For example, a research programme, public information c amp a ign s, recommend ations and so on
This communication does not pre t end to be the final word on this issue ; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structure d present ation of the principle and its oper ational use
B y set ting out in some detail how the Commission appli es, and intend s to app ly, the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to cl ar if y the situation at Community level and to contrib ute to the on go ing debate at European and international level
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement
I have three short question s, the first being as follow s
We have been aw a iting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was any thing but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speak s with one v o ice
Do es the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commission ers for Ind ustry , F ore ign T ra de , C om pe ti tion and the Intern al M ark et ?
I am sure that your answer to this will be " y es " but I would be gr ate ful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequ ences of this will be ?
My next question , Mrs W all st r ö m , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation p ertain ing to ch em ical s or other sector s, for example ?
L ast ly, will we be able to recogn ise when this principle has been appli ed in legislation ?
In other words, will each proposal contain an addition al she et st ating that chec ks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ?
Thank you very much , D ag m ar R oth - B eh r end t , for these questions
Of course, this is sh ared by the whole Commission
This is a common communication which was wr itt en by the three of us, D a vid B y r n e, E r k k i Li i k an en and myself , but it has been pass ed un an im ous ly in the Commission today
It received strong support from the rest of the Commission ers and it has been through an inter s erv ice consult ation in the whole of the Commission
So we have really work ed through this document and I am sure that they are all able to des c rib e the guidelines and the principles as la id down in this document
Y es, I would say we already use this way of working with different , difficult issues like a new ch em ical strategy for example
And , I am sure that we will also mention it exp lic it ly when we work with this principle
We have just rec ently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it ca me to ban ph th al ates in so ft P V C to y s ; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas
It has been main ly used in the environmental field , but, of course also when it comes to human health
So , we will tr y to be very clear about how and when to use it
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relations hip between sci ence, on the one hand, and apply ing the precautionary principle on the other , the communication states that inv ok ing that precautionary principle always requ i res a political decision if there is a lack of scientific e vid ence
N e ed less to say, this accord s sci ence a great deal of power
We might ask ourselves , what kind of scienti st s will supp ly this document ation and what do they stand for ?
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be appli ed, provided there is a su fficient recogn ised min ority of scienti st s. I would like to ask , what is, then , the defin ition of a recogn ised min ority ?
How would you des c rib e this ?
What establish es a recogn ised min ority ?
If a political decision is invol v ed, I would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ?
The Commission ?
The Council ?
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this ?
What is the role of the scientific comm itt ees ?
What , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?
Finally, will this whole decision -m aking process be carried out in a transpar ent, public way ?
These are my three questions
Y es, Mr President, that is true
There were many and difficult issues and not always c ry st al clear , but I will tr y to answer some questions
Wh o will take the decision , who are the decision -m ak ers ?
We ll , that dep end s on who the legisl at ors are
This is part of risk management
They have to look at , for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to jud ge from what is know n about the scientific e vid ence in a certain case
However, it is true that it does not need a b ig majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle
It can be used on e vid ence from a min ority or where sci ence is inc om p le te
That is, of course, where you st ri ke a bal ance between this principle as a political to ol and sci ence
It is not always e as y to des c rib e exact ly how this process is done , but there is no question of chang ing the scientific b ase
We use the exper ts to get as much scientific information and fact s as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be done in the future
You have to see this as a to ol for risk management
You have to dec ide whether you want to put people in dang er, for example, or if you want to prot ect the environment ; and you have to look at the sci ence that is available
You have to assess all that and e val u ate the sci ence
Th en you dec ide to take a measure or not, to take action or not
So , there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scienti st s that we use today or the system of exper ts that we use today
Mr President, I have a question concerning an act ual , conc re te case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle
It is about b rom in ated fla me ret ard ants
It is a fact that these substan ces are now being disc over ed. There are increased concentr ations of them in both people and the environment
There are many people who maintain that they ent ail major risk s, while others question how large the ris ks involved in these substan ces really are
R ec ent ly, both S w ed en and D en mark urg ed the Commission in the Council of Minister s to take the initiative and ban b rom in ated fla me ret ard ants
I am w on der ing, therefore, if you are prepar ing such a ban and if it would not f it in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative

 ( S V ) Mr President, thank you very much , Mr S j ö st ed t , for this question
The issue of b rom in ated fla me ret ard ants is an important one
It was raised quite rec ently in the En v ironment Council by a number of min ister s who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done
We are in the process of look ing into this question and assess ing what know ledge we have today and what it is possible to do
A llow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be sy n on y m ous with there being a total ban
There may be a seri es of different measures which can be taken
It o u ght not, therefore, to be immedi ately inter p re ted as a ban
Wh ere b rom in ated fla me ret ard ants are concerned, there may event ually be a ban , but it is important to say that the precautionary principle per mit s the whole spe ct r um of political measures and initiatives to be taken
This issue is extremely top ical
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assess ment of what needs to be done
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a dis gu ised trade b ar ri er
Is the understand ing of this point the same on both s id es of the At l an tic O ce an ?
I think we are going to have problems particularly with h orm one - t reat ed be ef and g ene tic ally mod if ied c ro p s
W ill the Am er ic ans take the same view of this point as we do ?

 ( S V ) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Mon t re al , we have just sign ed a prot oc ol concerning b i o -s a f ety
We suc ceed ed there in agree ing, at an international for um , as to the defin ition of the precautionary principle
I consider it to be a b re ak th rough that we suc ceed ed in conclud ing this prot oc ol
I believe it will set the tr end for future discussion s concerning the precautionary principle . We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be inter p re ted
It is, more over , also ac cep ted as an important and effective to ol
Mr President, I have two questions
I shall tr y to be very brief indeed
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle
As I have under st o od it, there has been a certain lack of cl arity in some respect s as to how this is to be under st o od
Is it the case that a risk assess ment is first ly to be carried out , including a cost -b ene fit analysis ?
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost -b ene fit analysis should not be used as a to ol for decid ing whether the precautionary principle should be introdu ced
In st ead , the precautionary principle should come first
My second question concerns the b ur den of pro o f
I re me mber Mar g ot W all st r ö m being introdu ced as Commissioner in the Committee
At that time, she was talking about the des ire for a re vers ed b ur den of pro o f . In other words, a product ' s manufactur er is to demonstr ate whether or not the product is ha z ard ous
I want to know whether this also appli es in the document which the Commission has presented now
( S V ) Thank you, Mrs Sch ö r ling
These are two important question s, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to cl ar if y them
No , one must not begin by carry ing out a cost -b ene fit analysis . In st ead , the l at ter should be based upon an assess ment of what it is we know , of what sci ence has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the ris ks we jud ge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human being s or an im als
Wh en, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure , the one ch os en o u ght to be cost - e ff ec tive so that there is in fact no res ort to measures which are wh ol ly un re as on able given their de g ree of effec tiveness
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost -b ene fit analysis
The second question concerns the re vers ed b ur den of pro o f
It is perf ect ly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases
I have used ch em ical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this
There , however, we are concerned with that particular area , where as it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is h or i z on t al in the sense that it concerns the full r ange of specific technical areas that are of political concern
Therefore , the issues of the re vers ed b ur den of pro o f and of what the b ur den of pro o f is to look like are not especially discuss ed in this context . In st ead , it is a question of political decision -m aking and of the bas es for this
It is, however, perf ect ly correct that, when it com es, for example, to ch em ical s, we must ensure that we ob tain a re vers ed b ur den of pro o f
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite r ad ical in order to work , other wise we shall always be conf us ed by all the different inter p ret ations possible
I will give an example : a f un g ic ide has been pro ven to cause b ab ies to be b or n b l ind . It is therefore a ter at og en ic sub st ance
V er y well , it is a f un g ic ide , it k ill s off m ould
This ter at og en ic ity has been demonstr ated by just one En g lish l ab or ator y, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out t est s
N ow , in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health , the precautionary principle l ay s down that this product should immedi ately be taken off the market , which N e w Z e al and has done , for example
So I want to put this question to you . When human health is at st ake , or there is the possibility that human health will be serious ly affect ed, should we not perhaps carry out a cost -b ene fit analysis ?
The cost of a b ab y being b or n b l ind is too high ; there are no benefit s that can comp ens ate for this
In short , Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market , until such time as another l ab or atory provid es e vid ence to the cont r ary

 ( S V ) Mr President, no one want s more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as r ad ic ally prot ec ting people ' s health and the environment
Ob vious ly, I cannot adopt a st ance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here , but I shall go direct ly back and see what I can ob tain in the way of information about this particular case
The tr uth , of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other n ations too , have taken measures to prot ect their popul ations ' health which amount to using the precautionary principle , even if it has not always been call ed that
N at ur ally, it is not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an en orm ous cost to soci ety if the decision to take a particular measure is avoid ed
N or must it be a case of sitting and c al cul ating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure
I think , however, it is quite obvious that when it is event ually time to dec ide upon a particular step to be taken , it is often the case that there are many different cour s es of action to ch o ose between
In those circ um stan ces, consideration should be given to what is like ly to produ ce the best result
I cannot for b ear tell ing you about an occasion when the exp ression cost - e ff ec tive was used by people wh om one cannot perhaps im ag ine using it, namely when I was on a vis it to A f ric a
At a h os p ice for A I D S pa ti ent s, I m et two I r ish C ath olic n un s who were car ing for d ying A I D S pa ti ents
They were the first to say that, each day , they must think about doing what is most cost - e ff ec tive because resources had to su ffice for their po or pa ti ents there
We must be very careful about how we use resources
I believe we can le arn something from this
We must , of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective man ner and in such a way that they provide the broad est possible help
As is also explain ed in the present communic ation, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some s ort of cost -b ene fit analysis
Con sider ation should be given to what sci ence is offer ing in the way of know ledge , and this should be used as an important political to ol for prot ec ting the environment and people ' s health
Mr President, it is a r are hon our to be given a second opportunity to ask questions !
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question , when I asked about the other Commissioner s, for it may have s ound ed as though I was in j est
Inde ed you respon d ed in kind , as I k ne w you would do
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Go od w ill ask ed, that is to the conn ec tions we make between the precautionary principle and the world be y ond the European Union
I have good reason for ask ing this
As you right ly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where , as yet , there is no scientific e vid ence
How can we ensure that we will not be l ay ing ourselves open to att ack at any time, for example by our partners in the U S A , on account of the b i o safety prot oc ol not being ad equ ate to their purp os es ?
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industri al policy and fore ign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasion s with your pre d ecess or s, keep p ull ing the car pe t from u nd ern e ath you ?
That is exact ly what it is all about , other wise we might as well not b other talking about the precautionary principle here , Commissioner !
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication ' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of rep ud i ating ass er tions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protection ist reason s
I am certain that we are going to have more conf lic t s, for example with the United States
We should not be so na ï ve as to think other wise
E ver since we sign ed this prot oc ol in Mon t re al , we non eth el ess have international recogn ition and a common defin ition wr itt en into a prot oc ol deal ing with the environment , health and trade
This constit utes a good example, therefore
We should be in no doubt that conf lic ts may ar ise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle ar b it r arily
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our res pe ctive pe op les for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication
Thank you, Commissioner
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discuss ing it for al most two h our s and this top ic is now being view ed, so to speak , as more than an or d in ary aspect of administ r ation, even though , as we have been able to establish from the inter vention s, questions and rep li es, it is a top ic which we believe to be of consider able importance
The debate is cl osed
Intergovernmental Conference
The next item is the report (A5- 00 1 8 /2 000 ) by Mr D im it ra k op ou l os and Mr Le in en, on behalf of the Committee on Con s titutional Affair s, on the con ven ing of the Intergovernmental Conference [ 1 4 0 9 4 /1999 - C 5- 0 3 4 1 /1999 - 1999 / 0 8 2 5 ( C N S ) ]
Mr President, I will begin by thank ing the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very use ful cont act s
Let me also once more thank my co - ra pporteur Mr Le in en for our excellent co ll ab or ation
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the im min ent enlargement
The work of the Conference will deter min e the structure and m eth od based on which Europe will be function ing in the tw enti eth cent ur y
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effective ly, more democratic ally and with complete transparency , clearly what we need is an ext ensive and in - d ep th reform of the institutions and the way they work
The first and substan tive pr ere qu is ite for achie ving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work
F rom the decisions made at the H els ink i S um mit , it em erg es that the agenda ag reed there is un s a tis fact ory and does not guarantee the essential and substan tive changes required for creating a more function al Europe, one that is more effective , more democratic and more transpar ent
This is because the H els ink i agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that rel ate in a fra g ment ary way to the structure and oper ation of just two of the European Union' s institution al bod ies
I will not repe at which on es, because everyone know s
My conclusion is jus tif ied on the one hand by the con st ant and some tim es very ins ist ent demand s of the pe op les of Europe and on the other hand by the h uge sc al e of the great enter pr ise in which the European Union is already invol v ed, namely enlargement
G r ant ed this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, proper ly address ed, would ensure the correct oper ation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions
J ust as it also must not fail to include every day issues which, for that very reason , are high ly vis ible to the European public
In its num erous deb ates and its report s so far the European Parliament has open ly support ed the con ven ing of the Intergovernmental Conference
At the same time, however, I am ask ing for it to include issues that improve and comp lement the reform , I repe at , of all the institution al bod ies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health , energ y, culture , transport and even to ur ism
Wh ether or not the agenda will u l tim ately be w id en ed is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to ext ol the political con du ct of the Portuguese Presidency , which has repe ated ly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end
All the same , whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way di min ish the importance att rib ut ed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference
This is because the institution al framework within which Europe will oper ate in the future is a found ation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the gre ates t national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to appro ve the opinion which Mr Le in en and I have put before you, so that on 1 4 F e b ru ary , the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives , Mr B ro k and Mr T s at so s, can proceed with the difficult task that aw a it s them with the European Parliament' s back ing
The same appli es to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner B arn i er for his co ll ab or ation with the European Parliament and for the very con stru ctive proposals he put before us
Mr President, the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Party was not satis f ied with the conclusion s of the European Council in H els ink i
It seem ed to us that the agenda lack ed cont ent, because our group was think ing in terms of the Treaty and, specific ally, the prot oc ol on the Union' s institutions
In H els ink i , the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union cons ists of fe wer than 2 1 States, a min im al reform would be su fficient . With more than 2 1 , a de ep er reform would become necessary
The European Council in H els ink i itself approved enlargement invol ving 1 3 new Member States
It is therefore inc ons ist ent to open ac ces sion negotiations with 1 3 countries while cont emp lating a min im al reform
We are therefore think ing in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a de ep er reform of the Union
Ha ving said this, Mr President, this Parliament is hold ing this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference
In the or y, we could have done so
We could have voted on the 1 7 th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 1 4 th
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to s end a clear political sign al to the governments and the c and id ate countries that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to fa cil it ate enlargement
Mr President, I am very happ y to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has ear n ed great respect in this As se mb ly
The Portuguese Presidency sh a res many of this Parliament' s as p ir ations and has comm itted itself to doing every thing it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is w id en ed to include other essential issues
Mr President, I would like to point out that this as p ir ation on the part of the European Parliament is not an as p ir ation to g ain benefit s for the European Parliament itself
However, the European Parliament will be re in for ced politic ally by the Treaty res ul ting from this Intergovernmental Conference
This is for one very simp le reason : according to the agreements made in H els ink i , this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues , which are currently decid ed un an im ous ly, being decid ed by a qu al if ied majority
Therefore , the number of issues decid ed by a qu al if ied majority will increase
It is already established within the Community ac qu is that those legislative issues which are decid ed by a qu al if ied majority are also subject to cod ec ision with Parliament
Therefore , since the qu al if ied majority will be extend ed, there will also be more cod ec ision with Parliament
However, this Parliament would not be fulf ill ing its role as a sup r an ational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union
That it is what we are doing
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be deal t with
These includ e, among st other s, the incorpor ation into the Treaty of security and def ence issues , which have made much progress recent ly, but which must be incorpor ated into the Treaty
Of course there is also the Ch arter of Fund amental Right s, and work be gan on its word ing yesterday , which I believe has st ar ted very positive ly
We are going to work serious ly to ensure that the European s come to see being European as an adv ant age and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are conn ect ed to the Union' s institutions
Therefore , Mr President, our proposal s, which we will speci f y in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produ ced an excellent document - and I am happ y to be able to say this here to Mr B arn i er - are going to be used as con ference docu ments
We will talk about this on another day
T od ay we must give the gre en light to this con ference , and, for its part , the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Par t y, Mr President, is read y to give that gre en light
Mr President, for the Social ist Group I can say we will be supp or ting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteur s on behalf of the Con s titutional Affairs Committee
We are gi ving a positive opinion on the con ven ing of the IGC precisely because we have been imp ress ed by the at tit ud e of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on bo ard our request that the agenda of the IGC be w id en ed
The Amsterdam left over s is not a very good term , because they are very important subject s in themselves
Let us call them the first three subject s of the IGC
These first three subject s are very important but they are subject s which were expl ore d in detail by our Member States during the last IGC
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need n ine months of further stud y
They need a political deal
It is more a question of n ine min ut es, perhaps n ine h our s if it is difficult , loc k ed away together in a ro om to reach a solution on these subject s, not n ine months
In those circ um stan ces it would be s il ly not to w id en the agenda
There are other issues that should f ru it ful ly be look ed at , especially before such a large w id ening of the Union to so many new countries
N ob od y is ask ing for a Ch r ist m as t ree
N ob od y is ask ing for an IGC of the M a ast r ich t st y le with a h und red or more subject s being deb ated
However, there are six , se ven , e ight , n ine per h ap s, subject s which it would be very appropriate and use ful to address
There is time
R e me mber the IGC that l ed to the S ingle European A ct
It last ed only five months
The IGC that l ed to the en orm ous M a ast r ich t Treaty last ed a year
On ly the Amsterdam Treaty last ed a year and a h alf and that was because everyone k ne w you had to w a it for the results of the B ri tis h ele ction if you were going to have any out come from that IGC so that was a different reason
A year is a mp le time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be add ed to the agenda
I am pleased to see that the Commission sh a res our view
The Commission has just p ub lish ed its opinion and it has done exact ly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a compreh ensive proposal complete with act ual draft treat y ar tic les
I thank the Commission for doing that even if , of course, I do not agree with every thing the Commission said
I think there are some g aps in what they have put forward
N on eth el ess the Commission has provided a service and I pay t rib ute to Commissioner B arn i er who is here with us today for doing that
They have la id out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC
That is all to the good
The Parliament, the Council presid ency and the Commission are p ull ing in the same dire ction for a w ider agenda
I wish you every suc ces s, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council ag re es to this agenda and that on V al en tin e ' s D ay when you start off the IGC it will be under good a us p ic es and you will bring it to a good conclusion , also when the French Presidency takes over , by the end of this year
We should no longer be wor ried that the agenda for the IGC will be restric ted
That is one of the political conclusion s that we must draw from the g ra ve decision of 1 4 Member States yesterday v ir t ually to free z e relations with a partn er
It makes it imp os sible for those same Member States, at the IGC , to fail to give oper ational mean ing to the protection and adv ance ment of fundamental rights
It is already str ange within the con vention that is dra f ting the ch arter to see representatives of some Member States, especially B rit ain and Fr ance, seek ing to ar g ue that a m and atory ch arter would some h ow be an inf ring e ment of national so ver e ign ty
It is v ital that the IGC prep a res the way to accept the inst all ation of a fundamental rights reg ime within the Treaty
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court
A not her is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Con vention
A not her is clearly for national parliament s and national political par ties to find a re in for ced role that they can play in side European Union affair s and to share the should er ing of responsibility to build European parliament ary democracy
My group strong ly wel com es the IGC and will be contrib u ting to this Treaty reform process to the m ax imum possible extent
Mr President, the Group of the G re ens / E uro pe an F ree All i ance belie ves that the European Parliament' s decision to r us h he ad l ong into gi ving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference under min es the political signific ance of the request for t al ks with the Council, and in the end , makes it rather ir re le vant
We would have pre fer red to have had greater cl ar ific ation of the agenda and more guarant ees on the m eth od before gi ving our opinion, and f r ank ly, we did not app re ci ate the disc ourt es y the Portuguese Presidency show ed towards the European Parliament by sch ed ul ing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for S ain t V al en tin e ' s day , the first day of the St r as bour g part -s ession
M ore over , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it, and inde ed, the majority of our group will be voting for it
I never thel ess wish to stress the fact that it is quite dist ress ing to see the lack of real interest in this reform
The event s in Austria make it c ry st al clear that we need a bod y or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bas es all the Member States
It is also dist ress ing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the cons ens us to allow them to act , and to prevent and rec tif y the course of event s
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference , and I firm ly hope that this opinion, that was given re lu ct ant ly, will not mean that the European Parliament c e as es to ex er t press ure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not mere ly a technical ex erc ise , but r ous es the p as sion s that we sa w a few h our s ag o in Parliament
Mr President, Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind , it cannot be said often or l ou d enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politic ally and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of dis gra ce ful
A fter all, we find ourselves in a situation of hist or ic importance , that is to say, we are negoti ating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which clos er European integration may be a reality in the not too dist ant future
How , though , is the Union to be enl ar ged if we do not do the job proper ly now , i.e. before enlargement takes place ?
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference
We consider it to be ind is p ens able and urg ently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will en able us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too dist ant future
My group , Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, not ed with satis f action that the Council Presidency is far from happ y with the current state of affair s
You can therefore rest ass ure d that the Con f eder al Group of the European United Le ft / N ord ic G re en Le ft is comm itted to see ing that the Union get s on with the tas ks in hand
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular , a Europe that the citizens t ru ly regard as being their s, because they are instrument al in sh ap ing it and because the ca res and concern s, the problems and issues they face on a d a ily basis are also taken serious ly by poli ti ci ans
The politic s of cl osed do ors and priv ate discussion s ; all that must be con si gn ed to the past once and for all
That is why we need transparency
I believe it fall s to you, as President -in - O ffice of the Council, to see to it that the tra in does not keep ro ll ing on as before , le a ving the people behind on the pl at f orm s as if they were i gn or ant as to the cont ent of the t rea ties
We believe it is imp er ative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with compreh ensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is go ing, and its out come , rather they must be direct ly involved in the over all reform process to a far greater extent
We also take the view that the political decision -m ak ers must at long last change the ha b it of a life - ti me and ask the citizens in refer enda , once the Intergovernmental Conference is over , whether or not they go al ong with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future
In this way , Europe would t ru ly be l ong to the citizens and the Union would ac qu ire an entire ly new quality of democratic leg iti m ac y
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to
As a member of the con vention that has now taken up its work on the Ch arter of Fund amental Right s, I wish to make the following point clear : ne ither my group n or I are cont ent with making a so le m n ann oun ce ment about the Ch arter
A fter all, what will the citizens say if we make a so le m n ann oun ce ment about rights to them but they are un able to take legal action in respect of these rights as individual s ?
No , to my mind this would only s erve to de ep en the cre di bility crisis fa cing the Union
The po or turn out at the European ele ctions really should have been w ar ning enough for everyone
What we need are vis ible rights for each and every citizen ; the Ch arter of Fund amental Right s must be made leg ally b ind ing for all the citizens of the Union
T og ether we should work towards this go al in the interests of the citizen s, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the rele vant C olog ne decision will be rev ised here at the end of the year
Of course, we are also talking about effec tiveness of decisions and function ing institutions in a Union of 2 7 pl us Member States
We will not achieve this just by undert aking a min i reform , as the Council has resol ved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under sc ru tin y
We need bo ld change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the gre ates t possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States
This is something I would st res s, particularly with my being an M E P for one of the major Member States
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that compreh ensive discussion s with the citizens will ens ue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised
There is one final issue I would like to ra ise
Parliament' s opinion express ly demand s amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy
It is indeed the case that global isation of national econom ies, but above all the introdu ction of the e uro and the as soci ated st ability p act have l ed to a situation where we need to do more than analy se decision -m aking process es
What we need most of all is to have the c oura ge to undert ake a cri tical exam in ation of the Union' s policies to d ate
It is all about creating a so cially just Europe
A so cially just Europe is still high ly top ical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against m ass unemployment and po ver ty firm ly at the cent re of the Union' s policies
H ence, to my mind , that includ es having the c oura ge to amend Article 4 of the E C Treat y, which def ines the Union in tra dition al ne o li beral st y le as an open market economy with free competition . The same appli es to Article 1 0 5 , in my view, for the European C entral B ank must at last be given the political task as ens h r ined in the Treat y, of using its mon etary policy to promote sustain ed grow th and employment
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of N ations Group con sid ers that the agenda for the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference , as set by the H els ink i Council, i.e. focus s ing str ict ly on the issue of decision making in an enl ar ged Europe, must be ad her ed to
It must be ad her ed to in the interests of the fa st , effective work of the con ference , prior to enlargement
This is why we cannot sub s c rib e to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to w id en this agenda far too much and, what is more , w id en it in the wr ong dire ction , i.e. mo ving towards central isation and an ever t igh ter European system
Our group has therefore tabled a ra ft of amendments which, when taken together , form a real al tern ative resolution
In them we say that the forth coming IGC must look into a decision -m aking system that pay s greater attention to national so ver e ign ty
We dep l ore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 2 6 J an u ary , limit s itself to following the r ou tin e p ath of a standard ised Europe enl ar g ing towards the East , a central ised su per st ate oper ating on the basis of majority decisions
The f eder al ists im ag ine that they are there b y going to create un ity through con st ra int , but this is a tot ally su per fic ial con cept
Q u ite the opp os ite , in an enl ar ged Europe, Mr President, the standard isation imp osed by the impro per use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing expl od ing
F urther more, the central ised European system , as we can see it develop ing today and as we can fore se e it by ext ra p ol ation, e ro d es n ations and, in e ro d ing n ations, e ro d es the national p at ri o tis m which for ms the basis of our will to def end ourselves
The Europe which results from this is not strong er but weak er, as it no longer know s what it is or what it is def ending
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the di vers ity and freedom of the pe op les of Europe was clearly recogn is ed, i.e. by adop ting flex ibility found ed upon the respect of national so ver e ign ty
We are de light ed today to see the progress this idea has en j o y ed in certain circ l es, one which are still , unfortun ately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission
A flex ible Europe, is a Europe which respect s its national democra ci es, which re lies on the support of its n ations, its national p at ri o tis m s, inst ead of contin ually per se cu ting them
It is this that gi ves us the deter mination to def end ourselves against ex tern al threat s, not the con st ra in ing, conv ol ut ed decision making proced ures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference
Mr President, I am spe aking on behalf of the It al ian R ad ical s and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament' s opinion is
It is no co in cid ence that the last inter vention is the only one that was completely opp osed to further European integr ation. I say this without being the s light est b it i ron ical about the high ly respect able position of Mr B er th u and his group , but it is no co in cid ence that the European Council ' s decision is support ed by those who are , after all, in Parliament because - and this is a high ly respect able position - they are f igh ting against further integration
This is the m ess age that Parliament is s ending to the Council
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my comp li ments to those already offer ed - can con ve y Parliament' s m ess age and con ve y the result of our medi ation work on S ain t V al en tin e ' s day . In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda
This m ess age must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow
We shall give an opinion - which is techn ic ally and leg ally necessary - on con ven ing the IGC on 1 4 F e b ru ary , but we shall give an un f av oura ble opinion of its cont ent
J ust consider the fact s : we look ed at Austria a while ag o, but we can also look at the st ock market s, Mr President : given that the e uro , that great undert aking , has fall en 1 6 % against the do ll ar in a year , then per h ap s, I will not say a government , but a good he ad of a fam ily should ask him self whether one can con ce iv ably tell the citizens that the only subject s open to negoti ation are the number of Commission ers or sim ilar issues
There is clearly a more amb iti ous go al
We R ad ical s have tabled amendments which we are sub mit ting to the House in order to con so lid ate this text , and for example, to request - just for the s ake of mention ing Artic les 6 and 7 - that the very min imum be done , i.e. , that the European Parliament should also be involved in draw ing up the European Con s titution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty
We know that there are other top ic s : for example, many Members have sub s c rib ed, al ong with us, to the issue of the se at of the institution s, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level
In conclusion , I hope that the m ess age that we give tomorrow will be strong and w ide - r ang ing for once , so that than ks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency , this agenda will be rev is ed. O ther wise , the challenge really would be lo st , not just for the present but also for many years to come
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite hon est when he talk ed last week about the Intergovernmental Conference
He said that there would always be un an im ity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft , plans are quite exp lic it ly being made for majority decision -m aking on issues relating to social security and on tax es conn ect ed with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major part s of the social system s in the Member States to be chang ed by a majority in Brus sel s, even if a un an im ous French N ational As se mb ly, a B ri tis h House of Comm ons and a D ut ch L ow er House should be against this
And , in this regard , you are going to the hear t of democracy as it rel ates to dist rib ution policy and people ' s social condition s, which are what v ot ers wish to inf lu ence when they go to the po ll s
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to dec ide upon as v ot ers and no longer be able to change on ele ction day
Brus sels know s best
Mr Prodi also ann oun ced greater transparency , but his draft regulation sign als a clear back ward step , and that is not only my assess ment , but also that of the European O mb ud s man
T od ay , the Commission is oblig ed, on a case -b y -c ase basis , to we igh consider ations of confid enti ality against people ' s demand s for , and expect ation of , transparency and, if the Commission' s regulation is adopt ed, the Commission will be en tit led to loc k away whole c ateg or ies of docu ments without having to give them specific consideration
There is also the des ire to create a legal en tit lement to confid enti ality and to loc k away docu ments of a kind which are at present public ly available in a r ange of Member States
U nder the b ann er of " p ro g ress towards transparency " , a r ange of docu ments is being loc k ed away from the general public
It is, of course, th or ough ly O r w e ll ian
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for cri tical sc ru tin y by the public
Mr Prodi sec ure d positive comments for a proposal which would other wise have been m et with critic ism, for the new draft regulation present s as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to docu ments in the Commission' s pos s ession . There follow s, however, a long , long list of excep tion s, and there is legal en tit lement to confid enti ality in regard to those excep tions
The French text contain s the word " re f use " and the En g lish text the word " s h all " , which means that the Commission is to keep sec ret such information as is today available to the public , for example in my own country
In addition , we have a flex ible cla use concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institution s, which may be used for any purp os es what so ever . It is therefore
( T he President c ut the speak er off )
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency ' s account has given me the dis tin ct imp ression that we are approach ing this Intergovernmental Conference with well - con sider ed ide as and a high de g ree of open ness
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they des erve
The prepar ations the Commission has made so far are on the right tra ck , although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s mo tions are any thing to go by
There is more to be said on that sc ore
It is cru cially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to sc ore a h at tr ick ; that of the power to act , democratic leg iti m ac y and transparency
In the end , it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve accept ance among st the citizens
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to fa cil it ate the enlargement of the European Union
If we have been having a different debate here in this Ch am ber today then that only goes to show how important this is
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government ele c ting to imp ose a total b l ock ade
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre - re qu is ite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to t rea ti es, which ent ail changes being made to legislation
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament' s cor res pon d ing po w ers in this area
In addition , we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to E conom ic and Mon etary Union, for there is a lack of superv ision in this area
The Fin ance Minister s beh ave as if they were in an inter governmental meeting , when in the E c o f in Council and in the Euro 1 1 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on
Un li ke Mrs K au f man n , I am not in favour of ext ending superv ision over the European C entral B ank as I am an adv oc ate of independ ence for the European C entral B ank
However, there must be an appropriate level of superv ision on the political s ide
F urther more, the t ri p ar tit e relations hip of Commission, Council and Parliament must be rest ore d to the sp h ere of fore ign and security policy, where h ither t o the Council was in so le ch arge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the c r ud e ly f as h ion ed crisis management measure s, for which the Commission al one has responsibility
The over all plan fail ed to do justice to any of this
We must exam ine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference
The Portuguese Presidency has ag reed to initi ate deli ber ations on this matter , perhaps to extend the m and ate
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to
The deb ates we are having these day s, on a certain European country ' s government , for example, show , do they not, that we must place the spirit ual , mor al , cons titutional , community and common wel f are - or ient ated le an ings of the European Union on a firm fo oting , and that leg ally b ind ing fundamental rights must also be incorpor ated into the Treaty for the same reason , as this will be a crucial st ab il ising fact or
I would urge those who are still very h es it ant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pl uc k up the c oura ge we need to make su it able progress in matters of fundamental rights
The European Union needs few , if any , new instrument s, and it does not need any new compe ten ces
What it does need are instru ments that will en able it to put its compe ten ces into practice
For this reason , we must ensure that the instru ments have the effect of en abl ing us to carry out , on behalf of the citizen s, the tas ks we have already form ally been set in the Treaty
In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentr ate its energ ies on
If we suc ceed in making progress here , then we will also be read y for the hist or ic task of enl ar g ing the European Union
This is the cru x of the matter
Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, I am confid ent that this will be t ack led in a su it ably positive man ner under your t ute la ge
, ch air man of the Committee on Con s titutional Affair s. ( I T ) Mr President -in - O ffic e, on list ening to the various inter vention s, you have under st o od that in the Committee on Con s titutional Affairs and also among the lead ers of Parliament' s political group s, the decision pre v ail ed - although not without some dis ag ree ment - to put our fa ith in the Portuguese Presidency , inst ead of creating more difficulties by post pon ing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference
I can ass ure you that it was not e as y to achieve this, last week in the Committee I ch air , but we event ually decid ed to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to w in this w ag er
You sp o ke to us about the start of your to ur a round the various capital c ities and to ld us about the difficulties that some governments have in reach ing a cons ens us in their own countries, and therefore in their parliament s
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worth wh ile day of discussion s and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliament s, which were represent ed by compe t ent and ex ac ting de leg ations
The aim was not to draw conclusion s - it was imp os sible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encoura g ing
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments tr y to conv ince their res pe ctive parliament s to ra tif y solution s that cor res pon d to the Union' s requirements for grow th and that they do not h ide behind supp osed res ist ance put up by the parliament s to avoid sign ing appropriate conclusion s at the Intergovernmental Conference t able
However, we shall int en si f y our co ll ab or ation and our dialogue with the national parliament s for the entire d ur ation of the Intergovernmental Conference
Y esterday , we also discuss ed the Commission, represent ed by Commissioner B arn i er, who g ave its opinion . This effort was app re ci at ed, even if different views were l ater expressed as regards the proposal s, and more over , Mr President -in - O ffic e, you also expressed different views
N ever thel ess, we must stress that many people are aware , as they were yesterday too , of the risk that enlargement could comprom ise the o ri gin al plan for the con struction of a political Europe, a risk that was , more over , indic ated in an inter v iew that sure ly es c ap ed no one ' s attention , o w ing to the authority of the person being inter v iew ed - J ac ques D el ors
We must , therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to con so lid ate the democratic bas es of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discuss ed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of princip l es, values and rights under p in ning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard , among other thing s, to run ning the economy
We are c oun ting on the Portuguese Presidency , we are c oun ting on ourselves and we are c oun ting on the Commission so that we can hold con stru ctive and dec is ive deb ates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference
Mr President, only a strengthen ed Europe can co pe with enlargement
On ly a strengthen ed Europe is imm un e to political opportun ists who exp lo it dis s a tis f action
That is why s w eep ing reform s are necessary and, h ence, a w id en ed IGC agenda
The Fin n ish Presidency only list en ed to min im al ist governments and, unfortun ately, turn ed a de a f ear to this Parliament
Portug al should not take a le a f out its pre d ecess or ' s bo ok
It is of the u t most importance that the European Parliament and the Commission j o in for ces for this IGC
In many way s, they share the same interests and the same in si ght s
An essential comp on ent of this joint effort should , in any case, be this Parliament' s right of ass ent to the forth coming changes to the Treaty
Of all prior ities, this one is the most press ing
What is the Commission' s ver d ict on this ?
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political fo oting and, therefore, not only within the working part y, but also at the same political level as the Commission
There is no reason what so ever why representatives direct ly elect ed by citizens should be involved in t al ks at a low er level than the Commission
N ot only do we o w e the s w eep ing reform s to the new Member States, but we o w e them to ourselves
If we allow Europe to be water ed down as a result of enlargement , we will d ro wn in our own political qu ag m ire
Mr President, there are day s when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a m as o ch istic ple as ure in s el f- m u til ation
A fter having restric t ed, on its own initiative , its participation in the IGC to two min or se at s, Parliament is now gi ving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC . The fact is, whether through weak ness or fo ol ish ness - nothing to be p rou d of either way , you will ad mit - in r us hing to give its opinion, Parliament is gi ving up the only le ver which the Treaty accord s it, i.e. demand ing a complete IGC agenda as a pr ere qu is ite before dec l ar ing its opinion
Wh y do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 F e b ru ary , as a matter of urg ency , when we could w a it , in a position of strength , until the open ing of the St r as bour g part -s ession on 1 4 F e b ru ary , and th us force an agenda that is complete , and therefore cons ist ent, on the Council
A good do se of h y p oc ris y is needed to over lo ok our weak ness today . H y p oc ris y to be regret ted b it ter ly, in our resolution , that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues , since in our ha st e, with b la me w orth y na ive t y, we are st o pp ing ourselves for cing through this more amb iti ous agenda
If there is a democratic de fic it at the end of this IGC , then I say that the political groups which so want ed this ha st e will be account able for this
Wh ether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to ex ting u ish the only sp ot light cap able of sh ed d ing a little light on the deb ates , the v en ue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union
I therefore inv ite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority , those who last No ve mber rul ed that the future of Europe was des er ving of deb ates that w ent far w ider than the Amsterdam left over s, to take up their p il g ri ms ' sta ff s and go and conv ince their own governments that this IGC must be extend ed, since this is per mitted according to the resolution of the H els ink i Council
B ec ause of the situation in Austri a, this is a d ark day for Europe
It makes us real ise that the v ict ory of democracy is never defin i tive , and that we have to work to conv ince and keep on conv in cing
In order to ass er t our fundamental values , they need to be la id down in w ri ting , as a matter of urg ency , and, be y ond this IGC , I believe we o w e Europe a cons titution
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discuss ing require s, precisely as before , that the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda invol ving r ad ical reform s of the institutions
The forth coming enlargement of the Union is used as an argu ment for this
I am conv in ced that this is an e r r or of jud ge ment
A f eder al and central ist EU which inter ven es more and more in the government of the Member States is in act ual fact less well pla ced for enlargement
A flex ible EU which concentr ates on fe wer but important areas and which respect s national differ ences and national democracy has a better ch ance of em b ra cing a significant ly greater number of countries
Par agraph D of the draft resolution requ i res a more coordin ated and more open economic policy at EU level
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about mon etary un ion
This text say s nothing about the major democratic and political problems invol ving mon etary un ion and the European C entral B ank . This is un ten able
If there is a des ire to make the EU more democratic , the whole con struction of E M U must be recon sider ed
The C entral B ank must be pla ced under political control so that the dire ction to be taken by mon etary policy may be govern ed by political objectives such as high employment and pro s per ity
Public control of the C entral B ank must be impro ved if this is to become possible
The r ig id and un s uc cess ful mon et ar ism of the St ability P act must be re - e x am ined and disc ard ed so that we might have a un if orm policy which has pro s per ity as its pri m ary objective
Article 5 6 of the Treat y, pro h ib iting currency specul ation or any inter ference in the free movement of capital , must be rem o ved so that dam ag ing currency specul ation may be chec k ed by means of political control
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments d om in ated by social dem ocrat s
It is rem ark able that, now they have the opportunity to do so , n one of them is demand ing any change in the dire ction taken by mon etary un ion
It also , of course, dam ag es cre di bility when it is st ated that mon etary un ion could constit ute a c oun ter bal ance to global ised capital
The resolution requ i res the European Parliament to have increased inf lu ence over the Intergovernmental Conference
It is, however, important to emphas ise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a con ference of the Member States
It is the Member States ' parliament s, or people voting in refer enda , who are to direct the development of the Treaty
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any form al inf lu ence over the negoti ation process or over ra ti fication
Mr President, the Committee on Con s titutional Affairs has proposed an ess enti ally positive text , which I shall vote for , even if I person ally had proposed a lot of amendments to broad en it
N ever thel ess, the event s of the last few day s show that all those who had made basic critic is ms of the way enlargement and the re vision of the Trea ties have been plan n ed were right
The Union cannot be enl ar ged to 2 8 without address ing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values , whether it comes down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand, it has a greater amb ition : the des ire to be a sup r an ational un ion , in way s that have yet to be defin ed, that want s to b la z e a tra il for civil isation and democracy in the world
This is what is and was me ant by the call for a European Con s titution
The amendment of the Trea ties was , however, limited to a review of some internal rul es, which was necessary and important , but did not answer the fundamental question : what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limit ations ?
However, politic s exact s its re ven ge , and having been th ro wn out of the w ind ow by a debate on a limited agenda , it comes back in , as a matter of fact, through a do or , and through the f ron t do or in the case of Austri a, since a party is enter ing the Austrian Government which seems to represent a ret urn to int ol er ance, xenophob ia and for ms of r ac ism
And it is not a question of link s with the past ; it is a question of pro s pect s for the future , and nothing could be more wr ong than the right and left taking a di vid ed stand on this
I be l ong to a world , the world of Li beral C ath olic s, which is not left - w ing but which hold s as de ar as any one else the values of to ler ance and common European values , and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values
The Council has done well to l ay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Ch arter of Fund amental Right s, in a European Con s titution , then we shall con st ruct a Europe without a solid , l as ting b ase
Commissioner B arn i er, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values : make the most of the ch an ces you were given by the De ce mber Conference to include these subject s and princip l es, because this is the only way we will build a l as ting Europe
Mr President, I am in the happ y position of being able to refer to a c ou p le of st ri k ing contribution s from a small group of N ord ic s cep tic s and opp on ents of the d r as tic and grow ing integration process which, look ed long and hard at , threat ens the whole of democratic Europe
I am think ing of the contribution s from Mr B ond e and Mr S j ö st ed t who point out that the present contribution contain s a str ing of re lative ly un con s ci ous but u nd ou b ted ly r ational initiatives d ict ated by the des ire for power and po in ting in the dire ction of a central ist and f eder al ist EU
They right ly included the problem with mon etary un ion and central ist government and presented a number of al tern ative democratic principles
I might add that all r ational political c amp a ign ing in my own country , D en mark , takes it for grant ed that, when we enlarge the circ le of EU countries to include the env is aged h uge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the b read th of the Union, we cannot at the same time purs ue further integration in dep th , that is to say en g age in a more int ensive qu al it ative integration towards a United States of Europe
However, that is precisely what is happen ing
With every single g e o graph ical ext ension to the area cover ed by the EU , we have seen how ext ension s in b read th have been follow ed by int ensive ext ension s in dep th , and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is cont emp lating , especially in paragraph 7 which say s that there should be more th or ough integration in dep th
In the light of develop ments in recent day s, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these inter governmental con fer ences and treat y amendments when government lead ers - in reality the European Council of Minister s - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State ent ail ing inter vention in that Member State ' s democratic process
You can think what you like about Mr Ha id er, and I person ally consider him to be a very dangerous poli ti ci an , but you cannot just inter ven e in an independent and f ri end ly country ' s democratic process
When we hold inter governmental con fer ences and consider changes to the Treat y, we must take into account the fact that the EU is develop ing all the time, some tim es in contra vention of the Treat y, as we have just seen
I welcome Commissioner B arn i er and the Portuguese Presidency here this after n o on
On 1 4 F e b ru ary , we will see the la un ch of the IGC which is to be comple ted by the end of 2000
This is a b ig task but it can be done
I think it is gener ally ag reed here this after n o on ac ross all groups that the H els ink i agenda will not be su fficient to cover the necessary reform to prep are Europe for enlargement
In other words we need to go further than what has been refer red to as the important " A m sterdam left over s "
These include the ext ension of qu al if ied voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of tax ation - the re - w e igh ting of voting in Council to favour l ar g er states and the number of Commission ers in an enl ar ged Europe
In relation to the l at ter point , Ireland want s to maintain the right to n om in ate a full and equal Member of the Commission ir res pe ctive of the number of Member States j o ining
We are prepared to consider re - w e igh ting the v ot es in the Council of Minister s, provided that the l ar g er Member States are will ing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission
I feel I speak for many small er countries when I make that particular point
At the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible di vision s of the Trea ties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Con s titution
We would accept the di vision of the Trea ties provid ing it would not limit the control the small er Member States had in the re - ne goti ation of the whole policy area of the Treaty
In other words, if we are not represent ed fully in the Commission we will not have an in p ut into policy discussion s
So we are w at ch ing that entire point extremely careful ly
We look forward to the Ch arter of Fund amental Right s and to see ing its cont ents
The Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 7 00 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be dist rib ut ed among the enl ar ged Europe
Mr President, I w arm ly recommend a vote in favour of the D im it ra k op ou l os / L e in en resolution , which clearly express es both our dis app oint ment at the in ade qu ac y of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible
In any case, this em erg es from the fa v oura ble sch ed ule we decid ed upon
I think that, under the present rules of the Trea ti es, the European Parliament would have little to g ain from a policy of conf ron t ation
On the cont r ary , we should concentr ate on working out pers u a sive proposals on the necessary reform s, in co ll ab or ation with the Commission whose own proposals are worth y of note
We must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliament s
That way , we will create a c li m ate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reform s
Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with wh om they will be negoti ating that, with the Union' s institution al chang es, we are fa ced with responsibility for the cons titutional development of the Union
They must therefore real ise that such issues cannot be decid ed on the r ational e of b ar g ain ing al one
The issues to be deal t with at this Intergovernmental Conference are excep tion ally sen si tive
It may be e as y to come up with solution s, but what matters is how well those solution s will stand up in the long term
I will mention two point that may create t ension
One is the bal ance which has so far been maintain ed between large and small countries
Europe is not, n or can it become a cl ass ic f eder al state
The solution s we op t for must be cons ist ent with the fundamental r ational e of the European Union, which is a un ion of states and pe op les
The other area of conf lic t is more difficult
O w ing to the im min ent increase in members hip , the bod ies of the future European Union must become more effective
This means that they must function more simply and more r ap id ly
B y its very nature , however, the European Union is, and will remain , a comple x and conv ol ut ed mul ti - governmental institution
P os sib ili ties for fa ster and more simp le oper ation do exist . Of course they do , but they are not un li mit ed
If the limit s are ex ceed ed because of a one - sid ed ques t for effec tiven ess, then the leg iti m ising basis of the European Union will su ffer
I am , however, op tim istic
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference m and ate needs to be w id en ed
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differ enti ation within the Union
It is unfortun ate that there has been no serious consideration th us far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differ enti ation within the Union, which will , however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as plan n ed
The Commission' s form er presid ent, J ac ques D el or s, has once again public ly raised the issue of a European Con f eder ation. He has also said that the countries in the v ang uard of integration should be able to proceed fa ster and that they should have their own institution s, for the s ake of cl arity
The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the H igh Rep resent ative , Mr S ol an a, have put forward ide as al ong the same l ines
L ast No ve mber , the Group of the European Li beral Dem ocrat and R ef orm Party adopted a position on internal differ enti ation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentr ic r ings for Europe : the on ion s k in mod el
In the next resolution on the IGC , Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differ enti ation and flex ibility
B oth enlargement and the achieve ments of integration will come under threat un less we can create a system of concentr ic r ing s, as proposed by the Group of the European Li beral Dem ocrat s and R ef orm Party
My colleagues , Mrs Fr ass on i and Mr On est a have already sp ok en, some wh at s cep tic ally, about some aspect s of the matter in hand
I wish to add a v o ice of concern on the top ic of subsidiarity , not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own intern ally s el f- go vern ing regions
This has been given in ade qu ate attention and there are many things to be concerned about
M ay I particularly draw attention to one of the imp lic ations of enlargement in respect of this Parliament
A c e il ing of 7 00 has been pres c rib ed as the m ax imum that Parliament can saf e ly become and remain a deli ber ative as se mb ly
If you apply the existing principle of di g res sive prop or tion ality , six se at s for every state and then one more se at for every h alf a million in h ab it ant s, you already have the situation where L u x em bour g with 3 6 7 , 000 people has more Members in this Ch am ber than W al es, which is a part ly s el f- go vern ing region of the United K ing d om
S c ot land , with a population of 5 million , has e ight se at s in this House at the moment ; D en mark and Fin land , with the same popul ation, have si xt een
N ow what is going to happen if we re tain a c e il ing of 7 00 , bring in 2 6 % more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s , I think i ll - con sider ed, prop o sition , that there should be a European list of c and id ates
What will happen to a place like S c ot land , which I represent here ?
It will become tot ally inv is ible !
Members of this House should not in these circ um stan ces be in the least sur pr ised that in these discussion s, people in S c ot land and other such countries are ask ing whether enlargement should not also take the form of ad mit ting new Member States from within existing on es
A grow ing bod y of opinion in S c ot land hold s that view
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a cross ro ad s is no doubt nothing new
It has been said many tim es
This time, however, it is true . We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are fa cing enlargement
The question is if we will undert ake enlargement whether we are prepared or not
W ill we enlarge with or without de ep reform ?
That is the debate , and this question must be address ed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference , its agenda or its m eth od
It is clear that the Council, for the mom ent, has not op ted for enl ar g ing with de ep reform s in place
That put s enlargement in dang er
It j e op ard ises any pro s pect of political un ion and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand
The Council must real ise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement bu il t on firm found ations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further
The Council is cons ul ting us and Parliament is gi ving its opinion
We want an Intergovernmental Conference , but not this one
M ust there be an IGC ?
Of course there must , but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference
The agenda must go much further
We must be much more d ar ing with regard to the issues deal t with in the IGC and we must be much more transpar ent and much more democratic
B e ing much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allow ing the Commission to ex erc ise even more - y es, more - its ab ility to take the initiative
We must clearly set firm objectives
The function al ist approach is over , for better or for wor se
The function al ist approach has brought us to this point
Ha ve we achie ved results ?
Y es, but the point is to make a qu al it ative le ap and, spe aking in political term s, this, Mr President -in - O ffice of the Council, means conv in cing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the wor st thing we could do at the moment
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House , at this stage , following this debate which I have list en ed to most att en tive ly and with great interest , I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the state ments which it has been my hon our to present to you in the course of recent wee ks in the compan y of President Prodi
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produ ced after extremely th or ough and me tic ul ous work , your two rapporteur s, Mr D im it ra k op ou l os and Mr Le in en, proposed that Parliament should adopt a form al opinion purs u ant to Article 4 8 of the Treaty and th u s, if this opinion were adopt ed, the Intergovernmental Conference could effective ly start on 1 4 F e b ru ary , as suggest ed by the Portuguese Presidency
As far as we are concerned, after produ cing the opinion expect ed from the Commission, according to this same Article 4 8 of the Treat y, we are pleased that the con ference can th us begin ear li er than anti cip ated
We know , I know myself , that the wee ks we have before us will be use ful to us
I would just like to make a few comment s, after read ing the draft opinion and after list ening to the speak ers on behalf of the various groups
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understand s the an x i ety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the con ference agenda
I understand this an x i et y, this fear that the agenda may be too limit ed, and yet I feel , as I said to the Committee on Con s titutional Affairs on ret ur ning from H els ink i , that we can work on the basis of this H els ink i m and ate
Inde ed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this m and ate, which the Commission fra m ed for its own opinion, but using all the terms there o f , pl us every thing between the l ines
We have not restric ted ourselves to the three so -c all ed left over s, which is, in any case, an incor rect l ab el
I do not like the term ' le ft over s ' any more than R ich ard C or b et t does
It gi ves the imp ression that they are three min or or in si gn ific ant subject s where as in fact they are three extremely serious and important subject s, and difficult , so difficult that we did not have su fficient political c oura ge colle ctive ly at Amsterdam to deal with them in dep th
As far as we are concerned - I am respon d ing to Mr S eg uro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restric ted ourselves to these three subject s, even though I do consider them as prior ities, and consider that they must be deal t with now
They are the first but they are not the only subject s, Mr S eg uro , that the con ference must deal with
We have deal t with other subject s and we have mentioned our idea that other subject s may be deal t with in this con ference , if the Portuguese Presidency first ly, and then the French Presidency , so wish , in view of the serious nature of the present j un ct ure prior to enlargement
We are read y for it, whether it is a matter of the Ch arter of Fund amental Right s, on which work has start ed, the C F S P and the consequ ences for the institutions of the current def ence policy negoti ations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continu ing to work : re or gan isation of the Trea ties
I have he ard many comments on the Commission' s opinion, which mentioned all these subject s and deal t with many of them in dep th , with specific indic ations of new draft ar tic l es, but no one has said that we were going be y ond the H els ink i m and ate
This pro ves that it is possible to go into issues in dep th while res pe c ting this m and ate, by using the terms la id down in the m and ate and all the open ings which it off ers
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the con ference proceed ing s, I think that Mr S e i x as d a C ost a will agree with me , on the basis of our sh ared experience , in saying that you would be wr ong to dis reg ard the level of the ref le ction and negoti ating group in which your two representatives , Pro f ess or T s at so s and Mr B ro k , are going to be working
Of course, the final trade -o ff s will be made , as in any institution al negoti ations, and I think this is no b ad th ing, at Council level , especially at the level of the Council of H ead s of State and Government , who hold the key to the success of this con ference in their hand s
Let me point out , in pass ing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member , and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role , al ong side the H ead s of State and Government , particularly during the final period
However, these Council proceed ings must be careful ly prepared
This prepar atory work , this fin e - t un ing, must not be o m itt ed, ladies and gentlemen of the House . I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and use ful , and that it will not just be limited to technical detail s
I think that all of us, the person al representatives of the Minister s of F ore ign Affair s, your two representatives , and myself , as a represent ative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail , but it will be after ward s, at a different level , one in which we will also be particip ating , that the last trade -o ff s must be made
Th rough out this con ference , ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the stat us of the negoti at ors which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying
And once again I should like to point out in this House , in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam , that wh ate ver the amb ig u ity or weak ness of the stat us ac know led ged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam , the quality of what Mrs G u ig ou and Mr B ro k said count ed for a lot in these negotiations
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position , I shall ensure that the contribution s of your two representatives are list en ed to and respect ed throughout these negotiations
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an obs er ver at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be
We now aw a it , therefore, with great interest , ladies and gentlemen of the House , your next opinion, in which you will speci f y Parliament' s prior ities and practical proposals for these negotiations
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negoti ations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other , al ong side the Council member s, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continu ally, every day , what the issues of this con ference are and what respon s es we adv oc ate in our cap ac ity as European institutions responsible for ens uring both the proper oper ation of this enl ar ged Union and the common interest
In the coming month s, ladies and gentlemen of the House , the Commission will therefore be working in close cooper ation, on good term s, with your two representatives , Pro f ess or T s at so s and Mr E l m ar B ro k , in order to recon ci le our points of view, if need be
Q u ite prob ab ly, our points of view and our posi tions will not always be the same
There will prob ably be differ ences of opinion, that would be only n orm al
The important thing is that we are cons ist ent, and I have been comm itted to working towards this cons ist ency ever since I ac cep ted the position of Commissioner
Our concern and our amb ition , therefore, on a large number of subject s, is to be on the same w a vel ength and to carry these negotiations forward successful ly
This will not be a matter of ch ance, since , let me repe at , I feel we have the same amb i tions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of tr uth for the European Union
Finally, I should like to make three addition al comment s, quite brief ly, Mr President
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr N ap ol it an o, the ch air man , and the Committee on Con s titutional Affairs for the extremely o ri gin al major initiative which it to ok yesterday in bring ing together the compe t ent representatives of national parliament s, the Committee on Con s titutional Affairs and the Commission for an initi al joint debate
S uch dialogue between the national parliament s, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important
I have said, further more, that I would play my part by vis iting each of the national parliament s
T om orrow , I shall be in L ond on . In a for t n ight ' s time, I shall be in B er lin
In three wee ks ' time, I shall be in Par is , and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive , and I should like to thank you for taking it
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency , particularly Mr S e i x as d a C ost a, for his pro ac tive approach . Inde ed, the comments which have just been made express a pro ac tive at tit ud e and a concern which mat ch his own : the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an inter im presid ency
It will have to initi ate these negotiations
We are well aware that they cannot be comple ted within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency , in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000 . N ot only that a conclusion can be reach ed, but that a successful conclusion can be reach ed, which is not necess arily the same thing
Con c lud ing negotiations is not the same as conclud ing them successful ly
The hand over will have been made , but the conditions in which the hand over is going to be made , by your self , Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency , are going to be extremely important , as is the nature of this hand over
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together , under your guid ance particular ly, in the course of these few month s, which is extremely important
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency ' s ab ility to bring this task to a successful conclusion , and indeed great expect ations there o f . Portug al is a small country , but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great amb i tions
A fter having he ard P ri me Minister G ut er re s, the Minister of F ore ign Affairs and your self , I have confidence in the amb ition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely pro ac tive way in which it will con du ct these negotiations
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months
Finally, let me repe at , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to po p ular ise the top ic s of these negotiations
These are difficult subject s, subject s relating to institution al policy and m ech an is ms which are not always e as y to explain
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Minister s, Commission ers to dev ote a little time to explain ing matters to the citizen s, to public debate
As far as the Commission is concerned, it will , ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to in au g ur ate and or ch est r ate this public debate
C ross -b order services
- ( D E ) Mr President, Commissioner, first ly I would like to ap olog ise for being a little ho ar se today, but we Austrian M E P s have had a lot of explain ing and talking to do
I would first like to say how inde b ted I am to the Commission for se i z ing the initiative , and for the two draft dire ctives we are discuss ing here today
It has there b y suc ceed ed in clos ing two serious lo oph ol es in the internal market which are of great signific ance to the European economy and to 5 million third -c ount ry national s in the European Union who are here as work ers or on a s el f- e mploy ed basis
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact jud ge ments from the European Court of Justice relating to employ e es, I refer in particular to those relating to the R us h Portugues a case and that of van d er E l st
These have , in fact, cl ar if ied that the freedom to provide services must allow for third -c ount ry national s to be taken on as employ ees of cross-border services and this without having to ob tain work per mit s
However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of vis a requirements and conditions of res id ence and consequ ently the Member States were un able to cl ar if y this issue
F urther more, not all Member States have ab id ed by the Court of Justice ' s ver dic ts with regards to the l aps ing of the work per mit require ment , and they still have a mul ti p lic ity of unacceptable b ar ri ers in place in respect of cross-border services ; b ar ri ers that are often imp os sible to over come , especially for the small er companies
The situation as far as s el f- e mploy ed people are concerned is that current Community inves ted legal rights do not aff ord third -c ount ry national s the right to provide cross-border services
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here
B oth draft dire ctives seek to fa cil it ate the freedom to provide services for EU enter p ris es
It is not about establishing o ri gin al rights for third -c ount ry national s mod e ll ed on freedom of movement
All provision s, i.e. issues relating to ent ry into the EU and to the law p ertain ing to res id ence right s, should be regard ed as an ci ll ary to this freedom to provide services
I , together with the European Parliament' s Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et , are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has ch os en the right legal bas es and that the opp os ite view, as expressed in the report produ ced by the Council ' s L eg al S erv ice , is in app ro pri ate
Con sequ ent ly, I do not see that there is any real ob st ac le to the Council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft dire ctives are concerned
I also believe that Parliament' s proposed amendments should make it e a si er for the Council to adopt the dire ctives as opp osed to the Commission' s proposal
M an y of our amendments rel ate back to concerns that were also v o ic ed in the Council, and we are attemp ting to recon ci le these concerns with the task that fall s to us by d int of ext ant law and economic good sense
When it comes to accept ance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible , even if some of them dev i ate substan ti ally from the o ri gin al Commission proposals
I am absolutely conv in ced that it will be e a si er for us to achieve cons ens us in the Council on this basis
Tur ning now to the most important of our proposed amendment s, one of the essential differ ences is that, in place of a " s erv ice provision card pl us no ti fication for each individual contra ct " system , provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous no ti fication from the recei ving state for each individual contra ct
This system appe ar s to us to be un s u it able in practical terms
However, in order to comp ens ate for this, all possible ob st ac les must be rem o ved before the service provision card is iss u ed, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more str ing ent conditions must be satis f ied before a service provision card is iss u ed
An individual is required to be in author ised employment and to have the right of res id ence and ins ur ance protection , not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of val id ity and for three months there a fter
This should s erve as a guarantee for the recei ving state that the employ ee or s el f- e mploy ed person will ret urn to the s ending state once the contra ct is comple ted and that they will be cover ed under ins ur ance law in the event of i ll ness or ac cid ent
Li ke wise , the situation with regard to right of ent ry and res id ence rights should be cl ar if ied before the service provision card is iss u ed, namely under the terms of an opp o sition procedure
What we are propos ing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the op tion of apply ing for it for individual Member States
I believe this system is also more su ited to practical needs
I would hope that the same hold s true for the proposal to redu ce the min imum period of d ur ation for a first pos ting to three month s, and to be flex ible in ad ap ting the period of val id ity of the service provision card to the d ur ation of the first pos ting
However, we stand by our view that the m ax imum period of val id ity for the service provision card should be 12 months
When it comes to s el f- e mploy ed person s, in addition to the amendments already des c rib ed, we propose that the d om ic ile criteria should be made more str ing ent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of c oun ter ing any ab use in the way of b og us s el f- e mployment
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go be y ond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee ' s amendment s, which they adopted un an im ous ly
I have even sub mitted four amendments on behalf of my group that large ly rel ate to the correct way of qu oting Council decisions
I must say I have received extremely contra d ict ory state ments from Parliament' s services as to exact ly how these Council decisions should be qu oted ; whether or not one should use the number or d ate al one , or both , and how ext ensive ly to qu ote from them
T w o amendments were can cell ed by the services because the cont ent has supp osed ly already been given consideration to in the report
I with d ra w the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 1 8 to the report on s el f- e mploy ed person s and Amendment No 2 1 on employ ed person s
I can only urge the Conference of President s to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of com it olog y, i.e. the correct way to qu ote
This would make our rapporteur ' s life consider ably e a si er in the future
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Pal a ci o ' s report s
Un fortun ately I have to say that I am un able to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the sub st ance of the out come that we in the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et resol ved on un an im ous ly, and I would like to stand by this out come , which we ar ri ved at together after l ength y discussion s
On a final not e, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who support ed me in comp il ing these report s, which were far from e as y to produ ce
I would like to single Mr W ie land out for special mention , for he has the d ub ious hon our of being the sh ad ow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is c ust om ary in the draw ing up of this report, contrib u ting excellent and con stru ctive ide as ; and this without being in a position to rece ive the pla ud it s a ward ed a rapporteur
That is why he des er ves special mention !

 ( N L ) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introdu ct ory rem ark s at the end of rapporteur Mrs B erg er ' s speech , after which I will , of course, list en with all due attention to the next speak ers
If you allow me , Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate
M ay I say how the Commission wel com es the European Parliament' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third -c ount ry employ e es, the top ic of the debate
I am extremely gr ate ful for the work that Mrs B erg er has put into these proposals which are politic ally sen si tive and which constit ute a legislative challenge
I would also thank Mrs Pal a ci o most w arm ly for her major contribution as ch air man of the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et
The Commission particularly wel com es the sugg es tions made by Parliament for a more effic ient procedure for the issue of service provision card s
If the opportunity is creat ed to apply for service provision card s for one or more , or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flex ible still
The Commission also support s the proposed flex ible period of val id ity of the card
However, I do not consider a three -m on th period of employment to be su fficient to pro ve that an employ ee is res id ent in a Member State
The Commission also ag re es with a provision for cases in which the contra ct of employment between the service provid er and his employ er is ter min ated at short no tice
An effic ient procedure for iss u ing card s imp lies that companies which provide cross-border services can also ex erc ise their rights in conc re te terms on the basis of the internal market
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the op tion of system atic ally carry ing out ins pe ctions system atic ally with a view to saf eg uard ing public order before they issue card s
Inde ed, it should be possible for a third -c ount ry subject who has legal stat us in a Member State to be ad mitted to other Member States too
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public - order measures within the framework of the proposed d ut y of no ti fication
N e ither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal stat us in a Member State should be val id three months after the card has exp ire d
F o llow ing comple tion of the service , it is not accept able for the third -c ount ry subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided
That is why the Commission support s Mrs Pal a ci o ' s Amendment No 2 2 in both respect s
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission app re ci ates the wish that it should be clear what is me ant by some one who is s el f- e mploy ed and would therefore like to resol ve this issue in the amend ed proposal
These are a few introdu ct ory rem ark s concerning the key amendments
I hope that, at the end of the debate , when all the speak ers have contrib ut ed, I will once again be given the opportunity to e la b or ate upon the different amendments
Mr President, tomorrow will see a large majority within the P P E Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et , as well as the amend ed ver sion
I propose to conf ine my comments to two areas
First ly there is the question as to what this directive is actually design ed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account
My comments start from the pre m ise that we are talking about an up ri ght individual in g ain ful employment
Th en there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the recei ving end , may have to start from the pre m ise of a wor st case sc en ar i o
If we are going to ab ide by the one extre me , that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the h ur d les that have to be c le ared in apply ing for this card re lative ly high
There is also an argu ment for introdu cing ear ly no ti fication oblig ations as well as having this card
If I were to go to the other extre me , as few h ur d les as possible that is, then I would run the risk of fail ing to produ ce any legislation what so ever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place , but with the h ur d les fa cing the business world being so high , in reality no one would apply for the card
Al tern ative ly, I might have no directive at all
N e ither out come would be satis fact ory
P er haps this is also wh y, as is r um ou red to be the case, the Council has become b og ged down in its negotiations on this as well
We have been tr ying to reach a happ y comprom ise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of find ing the e a si est possible solution
We want to ar ri ve at a solution where certain h ur d les are creat ed vis - à - v is the business world , but once these have been over come , implementation is as e as y as it pos sib ly could be
Therefore we want applic ations for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States
If a compan y in France say s that it has an employ ee who has to work in D en mark on a per man ent basis , and only in D en mark , then it certainly o u ght only to be possible to apply for this card for D en mark
A cc ord ing ly, the bureauc ra tic h ur d les that have to be over come would be low er in this inst ance
In ret urn for this, however, we want ear ly no ti fication oblig ations to be dis con tin u ed, rather it should just be a matter of the employ ee taking the jus ti fication for the pos ting to the other Member State al ong with them , and this might take the form of the contra ct form ing the basis for his / her pos ting
Con sequ ent ly, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et
P er haps there was a certain amount of res id ual mis u nder stand ing on the part of the Commission
We want to achieve a completely flex ible solution
If a particular Member State was to dec la re that it had su d den ly run into problems because the individual concerned had comm itted a the ft and the card was for their country , then this particular Member State would be able to re vo ke this card , as it were , for the reason s c ited in this directive , which is al t og ether a flex ible and int e ll ig ent solution
A llow me just to go very brief ly into a second matter
M ost of those who have been working on the directive to d ate have been law y ers
We all know that there are still various part s of the Treat y, some of them very old , which are still refer red to as E C
We are aware that this directive is found ed on E C law and not on EU law
However, before the ele ctions we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the pres s, un ion s and companies that is - work ed towards making the Europe we have today more compreh en sible to the citizens
We have expect ed the citizens to take on bo ard the tr an sition from E E C to E C to EU
They have now g ot to g ri p s with " E U "
We would be doing ne ither ourselves n or the citizens any favour s if we were to ch r ist en the product we are propos ing to deli ver " E C service provision card " and not " E U service provision card "
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interest ed in , this is the one that count s in their e y es
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this dire ction
Mr President it is l ater than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this s ession so I shall be very brief indeed
One of the reason s why we are l ate is because we sp ent time ear li er today right ly st ating the ro oted opp o sition of this Parliament to any form of xenophob ia or r ac ism
This directive is, of course, not in itself direct ly about that
It is about att ending to the needs of the internal market , creating flex ibility and beh a ving in a reason able and flex ible way to en able the employment of third country person s both as employ ees and s el f- e mploy ed
That is in itself also about avoid ing being u nd u ly restric tive towards the str ang er simply because he or she is a str ang er
We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sen sible and proper provision , we will support the most li beral ver sion which we understand to be cons ist ent with the law
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first ly like to high light the excellent work carried out by Mrs B erg er and the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et gener ally, which has incorpor ated innov ative ide as into this directive , which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council
N ever thel ess, I have tabled an amendment
Mrs B erg er, in your Amendment No 2 to R ec ital 6 , you mention legal security
The first point on which we dis ag ree is the d ur ation of three months for the res id ency per mit , since all that does is create legal in sec urity
You right ly ra ise the concern , also expressed by Mr W ie land , at the possibility of work ers dis ap pe ar ing into th in a ir when their work per mit s exp ire , but I think that we would be making this even more like ly by bring ing in a three month per mit
If the val id ity of the service provision card exp i res on a certain d ate, it must end on that d ate
L eg al security requ i res this
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 1 0 , which ref ers to the first directive , you suggest that, for reason s of public security or public order regul ations, a Member State may reject the val id ity of the card
There are already some ex an te control s la id down in ar tic le 4 of the directive
It makes no sense for any work er within the Sch eng en area , since he or she will already have under g one a sc re ening process in order to enter the first Member State , and the second Member State would be jus tif ied in re jec ting ex an te the ent ry of that work er into its ter rit ory
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal in sec urity
In the case of a non- S ch eng en state , in the last paragraph of Amendment No 2 2 , that possibility is cont emp l at ed, and is perf ect ly express ed, and I believe this provid es greater legal security
The disc re tion al power of the State , which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 1 0 , seems to me to be inc ons ist ent with the rest of your excellent report
I would therefore ask Members to exam ine my amendment careful ly, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result
On the face of it these two proposals appe ar to be implementing certain proced ural changes to fa cil it ate freedom of movement ac ross Europe and to give effect to the recent cour t cases Mrs B erg er refer red to in her open ing rem ark s
However, in the case of the United K ing d om , we believe they go further than that in a man ner which is unacceptable
Par t ly this is sub st ance and part ly it is in respect of the legal b ase in regard to the special position of the United K ing d om
U nder the ar r ange ments contain ed in the Trea ti es, the United K ing d om re tain s its border control s
U nder the system proposed in these p i ec es of legisl ation, third country national s wish ing to move to the U K under the proced ures des c rib ed, will do so by v ir t ue of the service provision card iss u ed by another Member State , there b y by - p ass ing U K border control s
If there is to be a change to the present United K ing d om border ar r ange ment s, that change should be made by the United K ing d om Government and the United K ing d om Parliament and not en pass ant by the European legislative process
For that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals
Mr President, Commissioner, first and fore most I would like to extend w arm than ks to the rapporteur and to Mr W ie land for the efforts they have exp end ed in su m m ing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a bal an ced man ner
These two proposals contrib ute consider ably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubt less improve both the function ing of the internal market and the competi tiveness and power to act of enter p ris es
The str ict basic conditions att ach ed to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr W ie land on this - are essential , for they will s erve to prevent ab us es such as i l leg al ent ry and b og us contra ct s
Wh y do I think we need the directive so much ?
Th ree reason s and they are as follow s : on account of the economic importance of third -c ount ry work ers in the EU , in the interests of the competi tiveness of enter p ris es and the proper function ing of the internal market
Therefore , wh il st I welcome the str ict basic condition s, I would also call for the control s that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simp le as possible
My last question rel ates to something people con st ant ly approach me about and is therefore address ed to the Commission. W ill the directive pre j ud ice the ac ces sion negotiations ?
How is Article 1 to be inter p re ted and explain ed in your view, as this will have important imp lic ations, not ably for the ac ces sion negotiations and for our country , which sh a res common b ord ers with so many applic ant countries ?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, business pe ople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedom s, namely the free movement of people and servic es, did not apply to them
Inde ed, they were still subject to end less bureauc ra tic immig ration proced ures of the Member States where a service had to be provided
There are appro x im ately th ir t een million third -c ount ry subject s who res ide within European ter rit ory
I ass u me that, although the exact number of business pe ople included in this f ig ure is not know n , their number will most defin ite ly not be low
So , up to now , their access to the entire ter rit ory of the Union has not been regul ated by Community legislation
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introdu cing the EU service provision card
It seems important , in this respect , to under line that the service provision card will be iss u ed in a flex ible man n er, namely within five day s of a simp le dec l ar ation ' s having been sub mitted to a Member State where the service will be provided ; and that, also to prevent mis use , this document will have a restric ted period of val id ity which will not be a ut om atic ally extend ed
I have also pa id close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner
Ha ving also stud ied the amendments sub m itt ed, I conclud ed that we can go al ong with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be ref lect ed in our voting beh av i our tomorrow
M ay I , to fin ish off , thank Mrs B erg er for the great care she has taken in stud ying the different amendments and for having , in that way , add ed an important de g ree of mean ing to her report ?
I think that, with this report, we are , once again , one step clos er to the real isation of the internal market
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are gi ving me to go into the different amendments in more detail
In the course of my speech , I would also like to address L ord In g le w o od regarding the rem ark he has just made
Reg ard ing the first proposal on third -c ount ry employ e es, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amend ments N os 2 , 1 1 , 12 , 15 , 1 6 and 2 2
Amend ments N os 7 and 8 are accept able too , provided the situation of pos ting is established in the Member State in which the service provid er is established
The Commission also ag re es with Amendment No 1 1 , ex cept for the proposed period of previous employment of only three month s, as I explain ed just now
We also welcome Amendment No 1 3 in so f ar as , as a result of this, the card ' s area of applic ability is extend ed from one Member State to all Member States
In terms of com it olog y, Amend ments N os 1 4 and 2 1 also apply in part , in so f ar as the rights of Parliament are concerned
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 1 0 to be unacceptable as far as the three -m on th period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned
In this respect , the Commission support s Amendment No 2 2 , as I have already mention ed. The other amendments are unacceptable
P ers on ally, I am rather in favour of the term " E U service provision card " which is proposed in Amendment No 1 , but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this
As Amendment No 1 8 ref ers to Dire ctive 9 6 / 7 1 concerning the min imum w age which is already in force , no change is necessary
A c cept ance of Amendment No 1 7 by the Commission would mean that a simp le d ut y of no ti fication would apply if no val id card is iss u ed
S ure ly this is cont r ary to interests of public order within the Member States
Amendment No 1 9 is also unacceptable , given my thought s on Amendment No 1 0
The Commission has the same opinion of sim ilar amendments to the second proposal
I would like to add that Amendment No 1 0 to that proposal is wh ol ly accept able
As far as Amendment No 15 on the defin ition of the term " self - e mploy ed " is concerned, the Commission will , as I have already rem ark ed, provide an ad equ ate solution to acc omm od ate the objec tions l od ged
I would now like to move on to L ord In g le w o od ' s rem ark
He refer red to United K ing d om border control s and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includ es the United K ing d om , are under no oblig ation at all to ab ol ish or change control s at the existing b ord ers
This appli es, as already stat ed, to the United K ing d om and it also appli es to B el g ium , where it was rec ently of rele v ance
With regard to the rem ark made by Mr K ar as , I am under the imp ression that he is talking about the possibility of people from P ol and being used as employ ees in his country
The Commission would like to propose find ing a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ sta ff from non- E U countries
The question is, further more, one of whether the two cases should be treat ed in the same way
In my opinion, this is an issue which be l ong s to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happ y to make myself available to Mr K ar as in case he would like further information on this g en u ine ly important point
I will keep myself free in this connection
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very con stru ctive debate on the key aspect s of these proposals and, in particular , of course, the rapporteur, Mrs B erg er
Thank you very much , Commissioner B ol k est e in
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 1 1 . 00 a . m
Court of First In st ance
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratul ating the rapporteur on a report, which, on read ing it, gi ves the imp ression of simply confirm ing and ac cep ting the Council ' s draft decision
However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produ ced certain result s, such as the incorpor ation into the Fin n ish Presidency ' s document of 7 De ce mber 1999 of the commitment to w id en the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a stud y of the future mod ific ation of the organ is ation, comp o sition and compe ten ces of the Community C our ts
For this reason , I would like to express my app re ci ation for the work carried out by V ice - P resid ent Mar in ho
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential require ment if , in the future , we intend justice to be done within reason able time sc al es, and if , in the future , the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have em b ark ed upon
T od ay - and I must say this with pri de and satis f action - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstr ate the extent to which we European s believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market , and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests
B eh ind these princip l es, Mr President, li es the justice system
However, justice delay ed is justice d en i ed, and we must ref lect on this no tion
The working document prepared by the Court itself contain s al arm ing information
For this reason , the draft reform , which has been dra wn up by the rapporteur, V ice - P resid ent Mar in ho , is to be wel com ed
It is true that it is a st op g ap solution , but we must re ly on st op g ap solution s because , at the moment - as he him self has point ed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference
We have to offer solution s which, while provision al , help to provide a fa ster and more effective system of justice
I would like to make two obs erv ations during this inter vention , which st em from the report itself , given this Parliament' s oblig ation, in accordance with the Treat y, to produ ce a very suc c in ct report, which does not go into dep th
These are two of V ice - P resid ent Mar in ho ' s ide as and, I believe , they are second ed by the whole of the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et
The first is that greater resources should be given to jud g es of first inst ance, and that they should be given one more r é f é r enda ire
The second is that the trans l ation services of the Court of First In st ance and the Court of Justice should be s ep ar ated
At the mom ent, the Court of First In st ance has to w a it a very long time for its jud ge ments to be trans l ated
A cc ord ing to the Treat y, one of the found ing principles of this Community is l ing u istic and cultural pl ural ity and there is no question of our over lo ok ing the possibility of something as important as being able to read a jud ge ment in our own l ang u age
S ince we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference , let us consider just two points
The first concerns this Parliament
I believe that it is well worth ins isting that we wish to particip ate more with regard to the Court of Justice , even in the app oint ment of jud g es
A b ove all, we wish to see an ext ension of the compe ten ces of the Court of Justice , hand in hand with its cap ac ity to fulf il its oblig ations, in other words, its resources
We wish to see its compe ten ces extend ed, especially within Ch ap ter I V of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Ch ap ter V I of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible op tion s, certain clear limit ations of protection in these areas which are of ext ra ordin ary importance to our citizens
And I refer once again to the dec l ar ations which we have he ard in recent day s
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the cont ents of this report
It has caus ed me to ref lect on two problems which have come to me rec ently in my own constit u ency
B oth concern cases with decisions p ending before the Court of Justice
The first rel ates to a large su sp ension bri d ge and whether or not to ll s on it should be subject to V A T
The decision could have h uge imp lic ations for our local economy
Second ly there is a l ad y within th ir t een wee ks of re tire ment who is des per ate for new s of a decision that will affect serious ly her financial circ um stan ces in old a ge
These are just two examp les of real life problems behind delay s in Europe ' s system of justice
D el ay s in justice can mean person al difficulties and even tra ged y
This is not to say that all of our own national system s of justice are perf ect , but all too often they may be w a iting for a pre li min ary rul ing from the European Court
Am ong st the sta tis tic s there is a wor ry ing up ward tr end in the time taken to deal with pre li min ary refer ences
This should not be taken as a critic ism of the Court or of its sta ff , rather of the Court ' s structure and its lack of resources in a grow ing European Union
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an inter im p al li ative , but Europe is a legal con struction , its cour ts are central to its proper function ing
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and rest ruct uring of the cour t system
O ther wise we will all, as elect ed representatives , be fa ced with more and more cla m our from our citizens who are not get ting access to quick and effective justice
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report
I also fully end or se his find ing s, in which, in particular , he suggest s increasing the number of consult ants for jud g es at the Court of First In st ance and provid ing the l at ter with its own trans l ation service
In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we he ard , following the Committee on L eg al Affairs and the Intern al M ark et ' s vis it to L u x em bour g , that it is of course in e v it able , a G od - g i ven fact as it were , that the Court of Justice should take pre ced ence over the Court of First In st ance when it comes to using the joint trans l ation service , and so more often than not, important cases hand led by the Court of First In st ance cannot be given the attention they des erve
How ever I also believe that the reform s must go further than those we are to adopt here
For example, I believe it is worth consider ing making the Court of First In st ance that of L ast In st ance, if applic able , and making this a final compe t ence, in those sp her es where b ench es of the Court , which res em ble cour t s, pass jud ge ment at a pre li min ary stage - I need only mention the key w ord A lic ant e or wh ate ver the plans are for European civil service law
I am also aware that we are prob ably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inc lin ation to r en ational ise competition decisions and trans fer them back to national level
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought , as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First In st ance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions
We need to consider how we will deal with situ ations of this kind
Wh ere possible , one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the special ist ch am ber within the Court of First In st ance
In addition , we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which M E P s, not to mention group s, l od ged a comp l ain t against the European Parliament - for the Court of First In st ance to be responsible for such cas es, when in fact matters of a cons titutional nature are affect ed and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First In st ance
On a final not e, I too believe that OLAF requ i res monitoring under r ule of law
As things stand , OLAF is in a v ac u um and can do as it ple as es
It is essential for OLAF to be mon it ore d by a cour t
The only cour t that could reason ably do so would be the Court of First In st ance
That would be another way of sp urr ing the reform process on
Mr President, I would like to begin by j o ining those who congratul ated the rapporteur on this work
The European Union is a system based on law
It must therefore have a system of cour ts to en for ce that law
F urther more, if the cour ts cannot deal appropri ately and exp ed iti ous ly with the legal work lo ad pla ced on them , what happen s, as Mad a me Pal a ci o V al le l ers und i has already point ed out , is that justice delay ed bec om es, as we know , justice d en ied
The e vid ence of the cour t is that that is happen ing now and it points to step s which can be taken now to al le v i ate the problem
However, as Mr Mar in ho has point ed out , more is necessary , but that has to w a it for the IGC ,
In my own country , my th olog y tell s of the te em ing h ord es of face less Brus sels bureauc rat s but it never m en tions the number of European jud g es
There are less than three do z en at the a pe x of the European judicial order - hard ly an over lo ad given the responsibility of their tas ks at the hear t of the European legal system
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political imp lic ations of the delay in resol ving the out stand ing An g lo / F r ench disp ute over B ri tis h be ef which has caus ed such an g er in my country and such f r ust ration with the work ings of the Union' s disp utes resolution proced ures
This has been comp ound ed, so some who adv ise me believe , by the R ul es of Pro ced ure in the French cour ts which make it well n igh imp os sible for non- F r ench national s to proceed against the French Government
C ertain ly it is per ce i ved de fact o to be imp os sible
This contra st s most un f av oura b ly with the United K ing d om cour ts where S p anish fish er men successful ly brought an action against the United K ing d om Government in circ um stan ces which were very comp ar able
What is happen ing in Fr ance, Mr President, appe ar s pri m a fa ci e to be a case of discri mination against other EU national s on ground s of national ity and as such to be in b re ach of the Trea ties
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my rem ark s in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their find ings
I would be gr ate ful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final rem ark s that he will do this
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respon d as follow s
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First In st ance . The pur port of this request is, on the one hand, to trans fer the assess ment of certain appe als to the Court of First In st ance, such appe als currently being within the exc lu sive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of jud g es at the Court of First In st ance
M ay I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I list en ed with great interest to the ple as which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sy mp ath y for the une ase which under lies these ple as
The une ase is jus tif ied
It has been said more than once : justice delay ed is justice d en ied
The Commission sy mp ath ises with these consider ations. In the light of this sy mp ath y, I would like to continue my response as follow s
As your Parliament is aware , the Commission is conv in ced that, without fundamental reform , the Community judicial bod ies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reason able de ad l ines
Con sequ ent ly, the Commission has asked for the adv ice of a group of exper ts regarding the entire ty of the reform s which could be implemented in order to en able the Court of Justice and the Court of First In st ance to maintain the quality and co her ence of their administration of justice in forth coming dec ad es
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First In st ance to increase its number of jud g es, but at the mom ent, the form er is of the opinion that the proposed trans fer of compe t ence should be seen in the light of the stud y which I have just mentioned
In other words, once this stud y is complete , the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible
Thank you, Commissioner
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place at 1 1 a . m. tomorrow
E x cep tion al financial aid to Kosovo
The next item is the report (A5- 00 2 2 /2 000 ) by Mr B ro k , on behalf of the Committee on F ore ign Affair s, H uman Right s, Comm on Sec urity and D ef ence Polic y, on the proposal for a Council decision provid ing excep tion al Community financial assistance to Kosovo ( CO M ( 99 ) 0 5 9 8 - C 5- 00 4 5 / 00 - 1999 / 0 2 4 0 ( C N S ) )
I have been inform ed that the rapporteur has been delay ed for several min utes
I propose that we start the debate immedi ately
He will j o in us and speak as soon as he ar ri ves
I therefore give the f lo or immedi ately to Mr B our l ang es, in his cap ac ity as draft s man of the opinion of the Committee on B udget s
Mr President, this is an important and urg ent matter , and Parliament is comp ly ing with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quick ly, because today, you must real ise , m en and women are d ying in Kosovo quite simply because the te mp er at ure is 2 5 de g re es be low z er o, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a min imum of main ten ance and they have not been pa id
An urg ent request has been refer red to us, and we appro ve it
We have been asked for EUR 3 5 million
We agree that it may be grant ed and we call on the Commission to be extremely v ig il ant in ens uring , once the decision has been taken , that the amount s are set a side and pa id as quickly as possible. We are talking about m ac ro f in an cial aid
There are re ac tions to this in some qu arter s since it does not comp ly with the li beral can ons of be a ut y which sti pul ate that there must be no financial inter vention in order support an administration
This is not our opinion
Our opinion is that it is v ital to contrib ute to set ting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means abs ur d to contrib ute direct ly to the pay ment of public employ ees in this region
Inde ed that is something extremely use ful that we could have done in R us si a throughout the 199 0 s to prevent the dis int eg ration of that state
The second important problem is that we have been asked for pay ment s, the d on ors have made commit ments and, obvious ly, we are the only on es actually pay ing
The other par ties are not pay ing
We wish to see an end to this one - sid ed situation regarding reques ts for financial aid
We would like the Commission to make commit ments on the amendments we are propos ing in regard to this
We would like to link the gr an ting of all aid to the avail ability of the amount s due from the other d on ors
This is not in order to limit or be s ting y with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the cont r ary , to ensure that our contribution is being mat ch ed by the contribution s of other d on ors
F rom that point of view, the proposed fa cil ity is a two - ph ase aid fa cil ity and the second tr an ch e must be rele ased as soon as the d on ors have made clear their interest
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard . Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a reg ular basis , the list and the amount s that other d on ors contrib ute
When we come to pay , we want to know what the others are pay ing
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the inv it ations to t ender and the sch ed ule for their implementation
D uring the budget ary procedure we were to ld that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urg ency yet , according to our inform ation, no inv it ation to t ender has been p ub lish ed or initi ated to d ate
This is seri ou s, since it hold s up the whole process of recon struction in Kosovo
Finally, and this follow s on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on B udget s on a very reg ular basis , month ly, regarding progress on pay ments made
We have Commission docu ments which speak of firm commit ments
It is not firm commit ments that we need , just pl ain commit ments would su ffic e, and we need to know what has actually been pa id and, more espe ci ally, what has not been pa id
Kosovo has su ffer ed far too much from delay s in pay ment
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many tim es before , then we should also start by taking st ock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo , or of whether in fact any thing has been done at all
What I mean to say is that a few small step s have already been made al ong the p ath to n orm ality , and it would be n ice if they could at least be list ed in the course of such a debate
As of 9 F e b ru ary , there will be something know n as the Kosovo T r an sition al Council, which will comp r ise representatives of the political parti es, the min or ities and civil soci et y, and which is intend ed to be a qu a si inter im parliament
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equ ip the individual s concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prep are , for ele ctions are plan n ed for the a ut um n
No one really know s what these ele ctions are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be form ed as a result
No one know s what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis - à - v is U N M I K
In other words, there are quite a few imp on der abl es that we are not being inform ed about and that others are pres um ably un able to get to g ri p s with proper ly either
Of all people , it is the Al ban ian s, who are now being integr ated into the tr an sition al c ouncil , who o u ght in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in st ore for them
In addition to financial out lay and recon struction work , urg ent attention must also be given to rest or ing the co e x ist ence of S er b s, Al ban i ans and other min or ities - not for get ting the R om a of course - in this country , so that at some point in the ne ar future , on the road to co e x ist ence, it will hope ful ly be possible for some form of recon ciliation to take place
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been acc om p lish ed and that we can be pleased about
A d minist ration - wise there are now 3 4 tax ins pect ors
That is excellent new s !
There too , people are being encoura ged to pay their tax es, for it will not do in the long -term for everyone just to dep end on hand out s from the EU and from other d on ors ; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources
It should also be not ed that of the 1 9 dep art ment s, 4 already have administ ra tive lead ers hip , which represent s an improve ment on the situation there h ither t o
There is something else that we are k een to develop and this is very important for a state under the r ule of law
We have 1 3 0 jud g es and public pro secutor s, who have now been s wor n in , and who are read y to take up their work of disp ens ing justice , with a view to en r ich ing the culture of to ler ance there a little , and to at least being able to tra ck criminal s down and then sec ure conv ic tions
A not her positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old U C K is now b ound up in the recon struction of the country
I believe that is a good thing
I wh ol ly end or se what the Committee on B udget s had to say on finan cing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other d on ors to at long last pay their way
The EU Commission cannot pay for every thing
It is responsible for recon struction down there and for the F our th P ill ar , but it cannot con st ant ly be call ed upon to pay Mr K ou ch ner ' s out stand ing b ill s
One could do so once or tw ice , but I feel that the U N d on ors should contrib ute to this as well , for there is a very large ho le , as yet un f ill ed, that we are un able to f ill
We have a h uge task in recon struction and we will be jud ged according to how we fulf il it
Mr President, I would like to offer a few expl an ations
In a debate , there is always the dang er that we will repe at much of what has already been said
However, I would like to concentr ate on two points
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contrib ut or to aid for the recon struction of Kosovo
I would like to point out to Mrs Al b ri ght that what we have read rec ently in the press is true , and that f ig ures do not li e
Let us make this clear , how ever much some people may not wish to believe it
The Union has decid ed to assist with a further EUR 3 5 million in addition al m ac ro f in an cial aid for the recon struction of Kosovo , on the basis of an I M F report which es tim ates that a further EUR 1 1 5 million is needed for that recon struction
I would like to say to Mrs P ack that I am in complete agreement with her when she say s that the Commission should ins ist that other contrib ut ors fulf il their commit ments
I would also like to express my concern - which is very consider able - at the statement by some Minister s at the last E c o f in that say s that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to al ter , in any circ um stan ces, the financial pers pe ctives ag reed in B er lin
This call s into question the agreement which Parliament reach ed, with great difficult y, with the Council in De ce mber , according to which, when the Commission present s a mul ti ann ual programme for recon struction , the financial pers pe ctives would be review ed where necessary
I would like to appe al to those Minister s not to c ast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am g l ad that Commissioner S ol b es is here with us this even ing - to present us in time with this mul ti ann ual fin ance programme, with the cor res pon d ing report, reques ted by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the pre li min ary draft of the next budget is dra wn up , as we have been prom ised
L ast ly, I would like to ins ist that, although we have ag reed to EUR 3 5 million now , we know that this is a st op g ap solution and that it is not enough , and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the mul ti ann ual recon struction programme for Kosovo , which is so b ad ly needed
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ple ase ex cu se my l ate ar ri val , but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the p ity
The Committee on F ore ign Affair s, H uman Right s, Comm on Sec urity and D ef ence Polic y would adv ise you to rele ase the EUR 3 5 million , and this p ie ce of adv ice is given because this money can t ru ly benefit those in need
The things that have given us cause for critic ism are not so serious as to st op us w an ting to help the people there
However, this does not mean that we will for get the critic ism in the process
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not for g ot ten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official docu ments
On ly then would we have been able to con du ct proper and s earch ing discussion s
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to over lo ok this
However, we must be sure to introdu ce certain conditions here
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sen sible use of it and not to those who might use it for purs u ing other aim s. In other words, we should ensure that the money fall s to Mr K ou ch ner ' s sp h ere of compe t ence and not to other sp her es
Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there , we believe that the other d on ors must also fulf il the oblig ations they have enter ed into
This m ission is being con du ct ed under the a us p ic es of the United N ations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulf il its oblig ations
It is no less inc um b ent on the other d on or countries to fulf il their oblig ations within this time f ra me , in the interests of the person s affect ed
This b r ings me on t o the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more int ensive ly with this issue in general term s, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with over all develop ments in s ou th - e ast Europe, and with the aid deli ver ed there
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political lead ers hip lack s co her ence
We have so many coordin ator s, who , in turn , are responsible to so many employ ers, that we will soon have to employ a coordin ator for the coordin at ors
P er haps it would be better , however, if the posi tions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the O S C E to the United N ations, were to get together some time to introdu ce a un if orm , coordin ated procedure and to exam ine how we can be of real assistance to the people there
I know that the Commission is think ing serious ly about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there , then it should also be given the lead ers hip , and bring co her ence to the situ ation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and as soci ations to be en g aged in competition among st themselves rather than inves ting all their energ ies in help ing the people on the ground !
B ear ing in mind that the con ference of d on ors for the st ability p act is con st ant ly being post pon ed - it is now set for the end of Mar ch - that no one know s which projects are actually in the p i pe line , that one cannot tell how things can actually be implement ed, and there is a st ead y st ream of new press con fer en ces, this does not appe ar to be the way to rest ore peace and recon ciliation among st pe op les to this region of Europe !
A cc ord ing ly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to se i z e this political initiative , so as to avoid us l and ing in such a des per ate situation again and having to rest ore our s ol ven cy at the end of a month . R ather , we must use this initiative to establish a long -term aid strategy for this country , and I hope that in the proces s, you will fulf il your political oblig ations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months
Mr President, when the All i ance inter ven ed in Kosovo its objective was to re - est ablish conditions in this pro v ince which would en able those who wish ed to do so to st ay there or ret urn , with respect for their own her it age and their own culture
If the All i ance is still active in that region , it is with the same objective
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an inter v iew given by the K F O R comm and er show ing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were st ar ting to be , particularly as regards security , crime level s had been rest ore d to an accept able level
Th ose rep res en ting Europe who are active at the gr ass ro ot s level in purs u ing this objective , and I am think ing in particular of the S pe cial Rep resent ative of the Sec ret ary - G ener al of the United N ations, are on the ver ge of des pon d ency precisely because , since matters are impro ving , there is less talk of Kosovo and the urg ent nature of the aid which is needed there is bec om ing less app ar ent
We must work to ensure that, in this pro v ince and indeed throughout the B alk ans gener ally, the r ule of sh op k eep ers follow s the r ule of the w ar l ord s
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect , certainly an essential e lement to the scope of action aff ord ed those people active at the gr ass ro ot s level
Let me re iter ate the comment which D or is P ack has just made and stress that we , the Members of the European Parliament, must fulf il our own oblig ations in this regard , while ens uring , of course, that we are not the only on es to do so
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first ly I would like to extend w arm than ks to the rapporteur, Mr B ro k , for his report
If the Council had work ed as quickly as Mr B ro k then we would certainly be a great deal further on
The Council ' s fail ings in this respect are a sour ce of much regret
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the pre m ise that we should , and must , provide help s w i ft ly, how ever it is also right to start from the pre m ise that we will not provide help inde f in ite ly or at r and om
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point , which clearly emphas ises that it is only possible , and per m is sible , to use the funds from the special financial aid to fin ance those Koso v an budget ary requirements ar ising from public or s em i - p ublic , commun al and other authorities and institution s, which are cont ro ll ed either direct ly or ind ire ct ly by U N M I K
Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support U N M I K and the institutions set up by the United N ations, in particular P ill ar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the par al le l struct ures that have form ed in Kosovo and are still in place
What is to be done with this money ?
I would like to high light the issue of human rights
The W est f ought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happen ing there today ?
We were able to put a st op to the m ass exp ul sion c amp a ign carried out by the S er b s but al most every day ins u pport able things happen : people are k ill ed, people are prevent ed from living there or are prevent ed from living their li ves as they see f it
E ver y single day there are att ack s on S er b s, on the R om a, on B os n ian s, but att ack s are also still carried out on Al ban i ans
I was in fact sh ock ed to read in the report, ass um ing this is true , how an Al ban ian do ct or , who was working in the h os p ital in the S er b ian qu arter of M it ro v ic a under what must have been great difficul ti es, u l tim ately had to give up help ing his k in s men in this h os p ital because there were con st ant threat s on his life
These are event s and situ ations that cannot be to ler ated
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the S er b s are even continu ing to oper ate a m ine in the S er b ian sector of Kosovo
There are , at the very least , r um our s that S er b ian m ili ti as are up to their old tr ic ks again
It is ir re le vant , as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is S er b s, R om a, B os n i ans or Al ban i ans who are threat en ed or k ill ed in Kosovo
It is also ir re le vant , in my view, as to who is working towards s ep ar ation and di vision in Kosovo
What is all - i mp ort ant , to my mind , is that the bod ies we are finan cing should achieve what we want them to achieve , a mul ti - eth n ic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together
We need more polic e offic ers, as we have now h ere ne ar enough
We need an independent judic i ary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need funds for the offic e of H igh Commissioner for H uman Right s
All of this needs to happen , and quickly too
If we do not provide r ap id assistance then the situation will det eri or ate and new conf lic ts and crisis situ ations may ar ise
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quick ly, to recogn ise the urg ency of the situation and make funds available
On ly, now we want to see this trans l ate into de ed s and we also want to see success in Kosovo , and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use , not ably for build ing up the polic e force and for establishing the judic i ary

 ( E S ) Mr President, I would like first ly to thank the Member s, and especially the rapporteur, for the spe ed with which they have deal t with this issue
This will no doubt allow us to rele ase the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr S w ob od a and Mrs P ack have mentioned
I think I have seen three ty p es of fundamental concern in t on ight ' s debate
Firstly, although much progress has been made , and we could mention c ust om s administ r ation, b ank administration or tax administ r ation, it is true that we must continue to move forward
However, in mo ving forward , what should we be finan cing ?
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of dis ag ree ment
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bod ies which can be provided with Union fund s, for example, Amend ments N os 3 and 5
In our view, however, in both respect s, greater ro om for man o e u v re should be left to the administration of the United N ations which, on the ground , is more aware of the reality than we are
We believe that to pre j ud ge , at the mom ent, where resources should be direct ed, would create more practical difficulties
In short , we should put our fa ith in those par ties who , in these areas, are better equ i pp ed than us to make certain decisions
The second concern which I no tice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr B our l ang es, but others have repe ated it - ref ers to the situation regarding the other d on ors
Is the Commission making an ex ces sive effort while others are fail ing to cooper ate ?
S ome of the amendments in your report po se this question
For example, Amend ments N os 1 , 2 and 4
I would say to Mr B our l ang es and to those who have raised this issue , that this is not the fundamental problem , although we recogn ise it tot ally
The fundamental problem is that, at the mom ent, the dist rib ution of the b ur den among st the different d on ors has been established in the state ments of the H igh Le vel St e er ing Group , but it is also true that they have no legal stat u s. This is simply a political commitment
That is the reason wh y, while ac cep ting its spirit , we would ask that Amendment No 1 be word ed differ ently - and we have s ent a note to Mr B ro k in this respect - so that it does not imp ly condition ality in the provision of Community resources
I would say the same about Amendment No 2 , which we would also accept with a s light mod ific ation, since the idea seems to us to be basic ally correct
Amendment No 4 is of a sim ilar nature . On this specific point , we can perhaps offer Mr B our l ang es greater satis f action
We have already sp ok en to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision , establishing this e lement of condition ality
With regard to the second contribution , what we propose is that the exact amount and the d ate for the implementation of the second stage should be decid ed in accordance with the ex tern al financial needs of Kosovo and the contribution s of other b il ater al d on ors
In other words, we should not establish condition ality , or we believe that it is more effective not to establish condition ality from the start , but, never thel ess, we should establish it with regard to the possible li beral isation of the second stage
In this way , we would have no problem in ac ting immedi ate ly. We would not create problems for the Koso v ar people , but, on the other hand, we would force the other d on ors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing
A third problem has been raised by Mrs D ü h r k op with regard to the mul ti ann ual programmes
I would remind you that these projects are mul ti ann ual
The programmes clearly have to take the ann ual budget ary contribution s into account
L ast ly, I would like to make some obs erv ations on the reques ts for addition al information which have been address ed to us
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of inv it ations to t ender and, in this respect , I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament' s Committee on B udget s with the l ates t statement of contra ct s and pay ments carried out since the task force was s ent into action in Kosovo
The Commission can commit itself to reg ular ly inform ing Parliament of the inv it ations to t ender which are p ub lish ed
We also wish to see these public ised on the Intern et , so that there may be m ax imum transparency with regard to this specific point
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remain ing information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of m ac ro ec on om ic assistance
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the ch air men of the various comm itt ees involved in this area reg ular ly inform ed, on a confid ential basis , if the nature of the information provided requ i res confid enti ality , on the different sch em es being implemented for m ac ro ec on om ic assistance
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can rele ase these funds and make a positive contribution to maintain ing the consider able effort being made in Kosovo by different parti es, so that we might achieve that situation of greater co e x ist ence and peace which we all wish to see
Mr President, I am pleased to see the con ver g ence of view p oint s there is between Parliament, particularly the Committee on B udget s, and the Commission, and we can ass ure you that, for our part , we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the perf orm ance of its d u ties
I do , however, have one small concern , when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commit ments made by their services in the Committee on B udget s
There was a clear agreement , good or b ad I will not say, but there was a contra ct . There was a clear understand ing between the Commission services and the Committee on B udget s that there was agreement on Amend ments 4 and 7 , i.e. on the idea of link ing the mo b il is ation, the implement ation, of the second tr an ch e of m ac ro f in an cial aid to the condition that d on ors should first have fulf ill ed their re lative oblig ations in terms of pay ment
But , if I understand what Mr S ol b es M i ra say s correct ly, then this undert aking was only a t ent ative one
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement
C an you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on B udget s, y es or no ? O r are you going to d ro p this pro v is o, th us b re aking the undert aking made to us ?
No , Mr B our l ang es, I think it is a substan tive problem
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the comprom ise which we ac cep ted
What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement , in the Council D ec ision , something like this :
The exact amount and tim ing of implementation of the second tr an ch e will be decid ed in due course taking into account develop ments in Kosovo ' s ex tern al finan cing needs and contribution s from other b il ater al d on ors
With this, we believe that we are tot ally in line with what we ag reed
I am simply ask ing the Commission to come and inform the Committee on B udget s before implementing the second tr an ch e
I agree , absolute ly. We shall do so
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place at 1 1 a . m. tomorrow
A L T E N ER
The next item is the report (A5- 00 1 1 /2 000 ) by Mr L ang en, on the joint text approved by the Con ciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adop ting a mul ti ann ual programme for the prom o tion of renew able energy sour ces in the Community - Al t ener ( C 5- 0 3 3 3 /1999 - 1997 / 0 3 7 0 ( CO D ) )
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr L ang en - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council
The project has been long and problem atic
In future too , there will be a need to invest he av ily in research into the use of renew able energy sour ces
Al though there is much that is good about the new directive , it is non eth el ess not without its def ect s
One example is the use of pe at
Pe at cannot be cl as si f ied as be l ong ing in the same group as f os si l f ue l s
If pe at cannot be cl as si f ied direct ly as a renew able , non- f os si l energy sour ce , it must form its own cl as s, especially as far as the issue of environmental tax ation is concerned
It is not right that pe at should be jud ged according to the same criteria as , for example, co al
The development of renew able energy sour ces is a parti al solution to end ing the Union' s dep end ence on import ed energy
R es earch is particularly essential with regard also to the EU ' s next r ound of enlargement
D epend ence on import ed energy affect s wor st of all many East ern European countries, whose economic structure is still su ffer ing from the dep end ence creat ed in the tim es of the So v i et Union on R us si an energy
The EU must ad h ere to the K y ot o Pro t oc ol on c li m ate
We are all concerned about the environment and our ch ild r en ' s future
The share that renew able energy sour ces have in total energy produ ction must be increas ed, but it has to be done in a r ational man ner
We have to re me mber that our basic energy produ ction cannot be based on renew abl es for a long time to come
For that we need a form of energy produ ction that does not harm the c li m ate : nuclear energy
Mr President, on behalf of the P S E Group , I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the con ciliation procedure for the A L T E N ER II Pro gram me
Firstly, however, I would like to extend w arm than ks to the rapporteur, Mr L ang en, for the t ru ly excellent work he has done on this report
I would also like to thank the lead er of the de leg ation in the Con ciliation Committee , Mr Pro v an
For as Mr L ang en said just now , we certainly had a to u gh fight on our hand s in the Con ciliation Committee
However, we can see today that the con ciliation end result quite clearly bear s the tra d em ark of the European Parliament throughout
Mr L ang en mentioned that a seri es of Parliament' s demand s and points it had to make relating to cont ent were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were al most able to meet the Council h alf way on even the most cont enti ous point , that of the finan cing for this mul ti ann ual programme for the prom o tion of renew able energy sour ces in the Community
This is not satis fact ory - I would like to make that quite clear
However, we ag reed to this comprom ise because it was important to us to en able this programme to be la un ch ed very soon indeed
For in the course of the next few years, the prop or tion of renew able energy sour ces is to dou ble , acc oun ting for at least 12 % of energy cons u mp tion
This is the European Union' s dec la red aim
That being the case, since A L T E N ER is the only EU programme to have the exc lu sive aim of prom oting renew able energy sour ces, it will certainly be have a key role
In the first place , this new five - y ear programme will ent ail ext ending the actions in the A L T E N ER I programme
This will include ext ending the exchange of information and exper ti se between oper at ors in the renew able energy sour ces sector , develop ing local and regional energy ag en ci es, and establishing new net wor ks for appro ving financial support , to na me but a few examp les
To my mind though , what is particularly important about the A L T E N ER II programme are the new actions for re lie ving market s at ur ation by renew able energ ies and those for implementing , supp or ting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan
We now have available to us a working p aper from the Commission' s services on a b re ak th rough c amp a ign , which is in fact a crucial e lement of this Community strategy
It contain s plans for financial support for all the main renew able energy sour ces sect ors
It is very important for this A L T E N ER programme to go hand in hand with this c amp a ign and to support it
The over all invest ment costs for this c amp a ign are es tim ated to be appro x im ately EUR 3 0 b illion
7 5 % - 8 0% of this is to come from priv ate sour ces, and this will be supp lement ed by public funds from the Member States and from the regions
In this respect , the A L T E N ER programme will be able to create new inc en tives and sm o oth the way for invest ment , and help us to real ise our amb ition , in the interests of environmental protection , the economy and creating new jobs
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr L ang en for his excellent work in this important matter
The conclusion reached regarding con ciliation with regard to the Al t ener programme as put forward by the Con ciliation Committee is, after all the difficult p has es it has been through , at least satis fact ory
M ost of Parliament' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding r ise to EUR 7 7 million must be seen as positive
The Union has amb iti ous go als with regard to increasing the use of renew able energy
There is very little in the way of appropri ations to meet these t ar get s, how ever
The appropri ations are needed for p il ot project s, research , information exchange and also to c ul tiv ate more positive at tit ud es towards the use of renew able energy
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renew abl es is to be b or ne by the Member States
This programme will hope ful ly encoura ge Member States to act with greater deter mination to increase the use of renew able energy
However, in the future , the Union will also have to increase its own in p ut in prom oting the use of renew able energy and ens uring that renew able energy is la un ch ed without ob st ac les on the market
P rom oting the use of renew abl es is especially important for the environment
The Union cannot achieve its environmental go als un less the use of renew abl es is active ly st e pp ed up
R enew able energy sour ces low er dep end ency on import ed energy and their increased use bo ost s competi tiveness
Europe will also be able to achieve a lead ing position in the industry that supp lies equ ip ment needed for the exp lo it ation of renew able energy
We should also re me mber that the use of renew able energy sour ces has a positive imp act on regional development and employment
M ay I also v ent ure to ra ise the matter of pe at ?
Pe at is not mentioned in the list of renew able energy sour ces
However, it is important , at least in Fin land , as a sustain ably us ed, s low ly renew able energy sour ce
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renew abl es
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the G re ens / E uro pe an F ree All i ance are pleased with the agreement which has been found , and their than ks go to all those who negoti ated so well in favour of an amendment which the G re ens were al most the auth ors of
It is inter es ting for me , as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provid es for h und red s of million s of e uro s ann ually for to b ac c o c ul tiv ation
This is a limited sector of the economy which cre ates hard ly any jobs and is not competi tive on the world sc al e
In contra st with that, I see the amount s alloc ated for renew able energ ies, which are not only an ec ological e lement but which look set to under go consider able economic exp an sion
S ee ing the market share that small countries such as D en mark have been cap able of ac qu ir ing in this field , because they were the first on es to develop that area , gi ves one food for thought , I feel , and I think that in the long term it will u l tim ately be necessary to actually increase the budget s for renew able energ ies
One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renew able energ ies to be firm ly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contrib ute to the economy and to job cre ation there
In order to ensure that at least 5 0% of the energy m i x comes from renew able energy sour ces, it is not enough to deal with a few h ot sp ot s that will be more pro fit able in the short term
Mr President, may I comm ence by comp li men ting Mr L ang en on his work
The activities of the A L T E N ER programme will promote renew able energy sour ces and I believe that such programmes m er it financial support at the development al stage as they offer en orm ous comm er cial potential in the future
For this reason , I am particularly pleased to see the mon ies focus s ed on projects by small and medium -si zed enter p ris es
The intern ation ally ag reed objectives for redu cing em ission s cannot be achie ved by these programmes al one . In this regard , it must be re me mber ed that energy policy remain s within the national re mit
It is imp er ative that national governments l end their full support to impro ving energy efficiency and develop ing renew abl es
I am pleased that Ireland has rec ently ann oun ced that it is going to sp end £ 1 2 5 million on the development of an environment ally sustainable energy sector
I would hope that the contribution of A L T E N ER would lead to more initiatives
As the final text right ly states , actions such as these can play a role in redu cing regional disp ar ities
I can v ou ch that I have already received significant interest in the A L T E N ER programme from my own constit u ency of Le in st er, a significant p or tion of which fall s within Ireland ' s only Objective I region
I support all efforts to close the g ap in economic development in inf ra st ructural provision s, including the energy sector
In short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commit ments on li m iting gre en h ouse g as em ission s from the energy sector under the K y ot o Pro t oc ol , while at the same time prom oting grow th in our econom ies
A L T E N ER will make a val u able contribution to the comb ined efforts of the Member States
Mr President, Mr L ang en, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mention ed, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of con ciliation with the Council on the A L T E N ER programme
Mr L ang en mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initi ally F F 7 4 million , where as the Commission proposed 8 1 . 1 million , a f ig ure which the European Parliament support ed
An initi al con ciliation meeting was not successful , because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1 . 9 million
We could not agree with a proposal like this, which chall eng ed the authority of the European Parliament
A second r ound of con ciliation achie ved an increase of EUR 1 . 1 million in order to reach this comprom ise f ig ure of 7 7 million
In sp ite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initi al proposal , person ally, once again I dep l ore the fact that the funds alloc ated do not mat ch up to the amb i tions expressed and that the concern to sa ve money disp lay ed by the Council in this situation is in r ud e contra st to its dec l ar ations in favour of the safety of the energy supp ly, job cre ation and environmental protection , chall eng es that are just as significant which we must face up to
In fact, renew able energ ies un ques tion ably provide a way of achie ving these objectives
However, in sp ite of the res erv ations I am express ing on the p au c ity of the financial alloc ation, I person ally support the comprom ise , by v ir t ue of the programme ' s cont ent, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as , following the ent ry into force of the Amsterdam Treat y, this sector become subject to cod ec ision
It is prac tic ally certain that, with the ra ft of proposed measures and action s, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12 % renew able energy share by 2 01 0 , doub ling the current r ate, as long as the appropri ations including state appropri ations are made available
This programme, together with the S A V E II programme, int e gra ting the environmental aspect into energy policy, establish es a found ation for a real Community strategy to achieve c le an energy while redu cing our dep end ence
And , in conclusion , Mr President, let me also ins ist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures propos ed, there are also legislative measures and, most espe ci ally, ad equ ate budget alloc ations to back up these political initiatives
And I shall end , of course, by congratul ating Mr L ang en, our rapporteur, on his work , as well as all the members of the committee and of the Con ciliation Committee

 ( E S ) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first ly I wish to express my satis f action with the agreement reached on the A L T E N ER II programme in the Con ciliation Committee and as soci ate myself with the comments of the different speak ers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the A L T E N ER programme to be incorpor ated soon into the framework energy programme
All of this will provide greater coordin ation, transparency and efficiency in our energy programm es, into which we will also have to incorpor ate the S A V E programme, which we will be discuss ing soon
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality , and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr L ang en and also all the various speak ers who have sp ok en both in committee and here in pl en ary
Ob vious ly, there have been argu ment s, we had to go to con cili ation, as the rapporteur and Mr C a ud ron remind ed us a moment ag o, since at the first meeting no result was achie v ed, and there had to be a second meeting , despite the fact that the f ig ures were not ex ces sive
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reason able agreement , which, like all agreement s, is perhaps not perf ect , but which, I believe , allow s us to p us h a he ad with the projects with which we were deal ing
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr L ang en, on his work , to thank the speak ers and, of course, to ac know ledge the actions of V ice - P resid ent Pro v an throughout the con ciliation procedure , who contrib ut ed effici ently to the achieve ment of a positive result
I would also like to recogn ise the reason able and flex ible action of the Council
S A V E
The next item is the report (A5- 00 1 0 /2 000 ) by Mrs A her n , on behalf of the European Parliament de leg ation to the Con ciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Con ciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adop ting a mul ti ann ual programme for the prom o tion of energy efficiency - S A V E ( C 5- 0 3 3 4 /1999 - 1997 / 0 3 7 1 ( CO D ) )
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a use ful and th or ough con ciliation procedure and one that was good - te mp er ed all r ound , which is not always the case
I am happ y to say that I can regard the end result of con ciliation as very satis fact ory for Parliament as the joint text has incorpor ated all its amendments either in full or in a re - w ord ed form
The financial amount fin ally alloc ated to the programme is also a consider able improve ment on the Council ' s proposal at second read ing which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on S A V E and the conclusion at the con ciliation at third read ing
I would like to remind the House that at second read ing Parliament adopted this report contain ing e ight amendment s, including a re -in st ate ment of the Commission' s o ri gin al budget
The Commission ac cep ted five of the proposed amendments including the budget ary alloc ation and I thank the Commission for their continu ed support on the budget during the con ciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable
D uring the procedure , agreement was reached on the stud ies and actions to dev ise , implement , comp lement and assess the Community measures
C om p rom ise word ings were ag reed for five other amendments including legislative and non- leg is lative measures and the inc lusion of local energy cent res and, very important ly, the energy a ud it system s in the review of progress on energy efficiency
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress
The issue of the financial en vel ope was sta un ch ly def end ed by Parliament in the face of the Council ' s very me ag re open ing offer
In the event we had to have several meeting s before the Council fin ally increased this to a substan ti al amount
We g ot an increase of 2 million on their st ar ting f ig ure which was a dec is ive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirm ed that it could implement the programmes under
This was an important consideration for us
I would like to say how ever that it is, and has always been , a very mod est budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more sy mb olic than real
Fund ing for energy sa ving still comes pri m arily from the Member States
We have to bear that in mind when appro ving this programme
If there is more sy mb ol ism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level , this is a p ity because there is a lot of en th u si as m at local level for action , including Community action s, on energy sa ving
Wh ere the Community can step in is to put the local activ at ors in to uch with each other so that they can actually not re -in vent the wh eel in every region
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard
S A V E is the only Community - w ide programme d ed ic ated to prom oting the r ational use of energy
It focus es on non- t echn ical e lement s, help ing to build energy efficiency inf ra st ruct ure , and the purp ose of the programme is to create an environment in which invest ments and energy efficiency will be prom oted
H ere we need to real ise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy sa ving s
We have he ard a lot about difficulties of competition in renew able energ ies but energy efficiency sa ves money for bus ines s, sa ves money all r ound in fact and therefore it should be non- p ro ble m a tical
It is something that we can all support
I have to say, like m other ho od , although we all support it, some tim es we do very little substan ti ally and conc re te ly to help the m oth ers or the people en g aged in energy -s a ving
We could do rather more , consider ing that we have made great commit ments in redu cing C O 2 and gre en h ouse g as es and to redu ce dep end ence on energy import s
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something conc re te ly either at home or in their offic es or in industry to support action against global c li m ate change
If we could communic ate this it would be a very inter es ting thing to do
I would like once again to thank all who help ed in this con ciliation process
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs A her n for her work as rapporteur on this proposal , since she has contrib ut ed, in co ll ab or ation with the other Member s, to the achieve ment of a very reason able final result , which in some respect s even impro ves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what , from a budget ary point of view, the Council had initi ally ac cep ted
As Mrs A her n has explain ed very well , the budget s of both the S A V E programme and the A L T E N ER programme, are basic ally sy mb olic budget s, since the b ur den is should er ed by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even , in some cas es, the local authorities
However, despite the fact that the vol u me is re lative ly small , it is never thel ess sy mb olic ally important that there is a common des ire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action , which contrib utes to our g en u ine comp li ance with the K y ot o commitment s. This action also contrib utes to achie ving greater di ver si fication in terms of our energy sour ces, greater safety in our energy supp lies and, in the case of S A V E , to redu cing cons u mp tion and increasing efficiency in the use of energ y, there b y contrib u ting to achie ving the objectives set
F urther more, behind these programm es, that is to say, the S A V E programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy sa ving s, and the Al t ener programme, which concerns renew able energ y, there li es an extremely important techn ological challenge , which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the cre ation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole
With regard to the parliament ary procedure , I would like once again to thank all of those who have act ed and sp ok en, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorpor ated into the proposal ac cep ted by the Council, in this case prac tic ally all of them , although with some mod ific ations. I would also like to express my g ra tit ud e because an improve ment on the initi al offer of funds has been achie ved
This improve ment has been achie ved with f res h fund s, as we said at the time, and it has been achie ved while saf eg uard ing this Parliament' s pr er og atives and compe ten ces
F rom the point of view of the Commission, in this inter in s titutional g a me , I believe that this is important and I am very happ y to high light it
I would like once again to thank all the speak ers, and also , espe ci ally, the V ice - P resid ent, Mr Pro v an , for his m ag n ific ent work throughout this debate , particularly during the con ciliation procedure , as well as the ch air man of the Committee on Ind ustry and, also , above all, the rapporteur, Mrs A her n , and all the Members who have particip ated in this work
Thank you, Commissioner
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place at 1 1 a . m. tomorrow
C U L T U RE 2000
The next item is the report (A5- 000 9 /2 000 ) by Mr G ra ç a M oura , on behalf of the European Parliament de leg ation to the Con ciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Con ciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single finan cing and programm ing instrument for cultural cooperation ( ' C ulture 2000 ' ) ( C 5- 0 3 2 7 /1999 - 1998 / 01 6 9 ( CO D ) )
Madam President, I actually feel that we o u ght not to have continu ed discuss ing this because we said every thing there was to say in the last debate
Un fortun ately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always t al ks about culture but fail s to alloc ate any money for it
We have the feel ing, and are in fact conv in c ed, that the Member States would be more than happ y to with d ra w the things they w ro te in 199 2 in the Treaty of M a ast r ich t
For no one is very k een to sp end money on culture
S ad ly that is the case and we must face fact s
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has ch i pp ed away t ire less ly at this mon u ment al task , in con j unction with the Commissioner of course
We simply had to take on bo ard the fact that wh il st we actually at tain ed our go al in terms of cont ent, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect
One seems power less in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually has to reach a un an im ous decision
What kind of h or se - t ra d ing system is this ? C ertain ly not a fa ir one !
There are always people who are in a position to reject every thing and there we are on the other s ide , be gg ing for a little more money for culture
It is down ri ght sc and al ous what goes on !
It is an aw ful s ort of h or se - t ra d ing, based on une qu al posi tions !
N ever thel ess, we are pleased that this programme has turn ed out in the way that we want ed it to
It li ves up to the expect ations the citizens have of us
We will support small and medium -si zed event s, not the large on es, and we will aff ord individual citizens and also the small er oper at ors e a si er ac ces s. I believe that the fact that C ulture and, f it ting ly, E du c ation and You th now fall within the same Commissioner ' s re mit , will also s erve to guarantee more sy n erg y between these three programm es, which are certainly worth wh ile programmes for the citizens of the European Union
If one put s all the money together and cre ates sy n erg y then one can be a t in y b it satis f i ed, but then only a t in y b it
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of sy n erg y with a little money
Madam President, I agree with the fin e words with which the rapporteur be gan his inter vention and I must add that, during the con ciliation procedure , I was person ally a little dis app oint ed with the Council
On the one hand, it continu ed to ref use to accept the term " E uro pe an cultural policy " or other sim ilar term s, even under val u ing the terms of the Treat y, and it def ines " C ulture 2000 " simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more
On the other hand, it has sh own complete int r an si g ence with regard to the funds reques ted by this Parliament, which were min im al any way
In cid ent ally, this last point would be un f air to f ourt een Members of the Council, since it was just one , the N ether land s, which was responsible for that int r an si g ence
It has once again been demonstr ated that con ciliation is inc om p a ti ble with the demand for un an im ity in the Council
This demand makes con ciliation al most imp os sible and even affect s the di gn ity of the parliament ary institution
However, Madam President, these consider ations must not h ide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the Social ists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the European Union' s most important programmes
B y taking action in the field of culture , we are direct ly contrib u ting to the con struction of a European s ou l , especially given the fact that the sub - p ro gram m es which make up " C ulture 2000 " are su per b
In recent years, these have been among st the programmes most e ag er ly ac cep ted by the y oun g est and most d y n am ic citizens of the European Union
L ast ly, I would like to mention the prof ound ly human imp ression I have form ed of the rapporteur, Mr G ra ç a M oura : his know ledge , his sense of bal ance, his int el lect ual qu al ities, make him , in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had
C ong ratul ations !
Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner R ed ing, V ice - P resid ent I mb en i and Mr G ar gan i , ch air man of the Committee on C ulture , for the firm and int e ll ig ent position which, each within his own role , they have maintain ed during the entire con ciliation process
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thank ing Mr G ra ç a M oura most w arm ly for the t re m end ous efforts he has put into the discussion of this C ulture 2000 programme
It has been said before , and we have discuss ed this between ourselves on various occasion s, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area un t o itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excell ence for further ing the European idea
It is also of great importance to citizens
We should , above all, not l ose s ight of this
The im pe t us given to the European idea by this programme is having an en orm ous imp act , especially on small l ing u istic areas such as the N ether land s which not only has national potential , but is also re ly ing on support from the programme, main ly from a l ang u age point of view
T od ay , we have ar ri ved at the end of a long road
I would non eth el ess like , as others have done , to to uch upon the procedure , which is un c lear and, above all, un w ant ed
C od ec ision and un an im ity do not go hand in hand
They are like a s n ake b iting its own t ail
There is little ro om for negoti ation if one of the par ties states before h and : any thing is open for discussion , as long as the budget st ay s f i x ed
As it happ ens - and I would like to add this for the s ake of the N ether land s - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an ear li er stage
The result is 3 0% grow th , so we are not completely dis s a tis f ied with the result
Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always adv oc ate this - but I do think that this programme op ens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes
I would like to stress that culture is not only fund ed from this particular pot
C ulture does not only fall under the b ann er of culture but also under that of all kind s of other areas
A great deal of money for culture is also set a side in the Structural Fund s, and this is something which we should defin ite ly consider and bear in mind
F ort un ately, I am on the Committee on Regional Polic y. So I myself will make sure that this aspect recei ves due attention
I think that we have also op ted in favour of allow ing the budget to be of an ad equ ate si z e because , if it happ ens to be can cell ed, then sure ly this does not benefit the citizen
I have always given the rapporteur my back ing in this respect
However, I do think that it is necessary , as he always states too , that, in the next IGC , changes will be made to cod ec ision , when un an im ity will no longer be necessary
We are very positive about the many improve ments which have been made : no more me g a - p ro ject s, ro om for cultural net work s, and su fficient attention to prom oting read ing, trans lating and trans l ation companies
This is especially important to small er l ing u istic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs R ed ing for C ulture 2000
All that remain s for me to say is : time to get down to business
Madam President, all that I want ed to say has been cover ed by those fe llow Members who sp o ke before me and I think there is un an im ity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on C ulture
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very he av y hear t
N ot because our de leg ation, our rapporteur and the ch air man Mr G ar gan i did not work excep tion ally well - they work ed very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objec tion to Commissioner R ed ing ' s at tit ud e - I think that, given the framework she was oper ating in , her at tit ud e was particularly positive - but because of the ne g ative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council
It is sh a me ful !
That f ig ure of EUR 1 6 7 million for so many years is a dis gra ce for the European Union !
When we are compe ll ed l iter ally to h um ili ate the at re group s, y oun g m us ic ian s, p ion e er ing activities in the ar t s, w rit ers, to h um ili ate them and s end them p ack ing with a s la p on the back and th ir ty re jec tion s li p s in such a way that they begin to per ce ive Europe as something fore ign , something opp os ed, cont r ary and h os ti le to any effort towards cultural cre a tiv ity - an area in which the European Union should make its pres ence f el t because our m ission is not just the e uro , not just enlargement , n or g e ost r ateg ic exp edi ent s, but also to encoura ge culture to f low er in this affair of European Un ific ation - then this is indeed a s or ry way to end
So long as we continue to have un an im ity , so long as yesterday the D ut ch Government was able to imp ose those EUR 1 6 7 million as an u l tim at um and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be tell ing us what cultural activities we can purs ue , we will never progress
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to c ut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a mean ing ful cultural im pe t us within the European area may be r id of this con st ra int by all the governments
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur ' s analysis and I would also like to thank the ch air man of the Committee on C ulture , Mr G ar gan i , for his p ra ise w orth y work in a medi ation process that was also , consider ably difficult
Of course, we f el t the need to simp li f y and con so lid ate the previous programm es, but everyone h op ed that the C ulture programme could help to promote , for example, the un i q ue fe at ures of each cultural sector , even - and I could say especially - of the un i q ue fe at ures of less well - know n sect ors
We hope that this, at the least , will come about during the e val u ation process
We s in c ere ly believe in the val id ity of cultural action , among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social , as well as economic , development of a people
And a fully -f led ged Europe can compe te with the rest of the world and fully red is c over its ro ot s, high light its common cultural her it age and en h ance and rest ore di gn ity to cultural and l ing u istic is land s that until now were less well - know n
As for the important e du c ational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture , one of the programme ' s most obvious limit ations is the level of funding - we have he ard this several tim es - which c ens ures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action : the document which prior iti s es the economic fact or over social integration also bear s w it ness to this
The over all grow th of the European Union and the aw ar en ess of being European citizens : this is why we believe that the C ulture 2000 programme, al b e it with a sc ar c ity of fund s, can make a consider able contribution to this great common go al
Madam President, I will add to the un an im ity of the even ing and say that I support the adop tion of C ulture 2000 and add my than ks to the rapporteur, Mr G ra ç a M oura , who to ok over from our form er colleag ue N an a M ous k ou ri
B oth of them have done a first -c l ass job
Al ong side the debate we had ear li er on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it is ; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urg ent to get in the way of the important
Wh y do I say that culture is important ?
We ll in simp le economic term s, Europe ' s culture add s to g en u ine pro s per ity
Wh ere would Europe ' s to ur ism industry be without the r ich ness of our culture ?
But , more important ly than that, cultural activities are what make man k ind civil ised
C ulture is at the ro ot of our democratic belie f s ; and an un c ulture d soci ety is not going to sustain to ler ance and freedom and democracy
C ult ural di vers ity is important , and it is under threat
However, it is not under threat from Europe
M an y people in my country say they see B ri tis h culture being under threat , for example, from Portug al , from German y, from Fin land , for he a ven ' s s ake
We do d r ink p ort w ine , and we do like German be er, and we even use Fin n ish sa un as , but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat
What I do see right ac ross Europe is people d r ink ing C oc a C ol a, e ating ha mb ur g ers, we ar ing b ase b all cap s, w at ch ing H ol ly w o od f il ms and often doing all this at the same time
N ow I do not believe that protection ism and regulation is the way of def ending Europe ' s culture , but I do believe in l ending a help ing hand when we can
That is what C ulture 2000 is about
So , I say to the Council of Minister s : K eep this programme g en u ine ly under review
A re we doing enough ?
And , I say to Mad a me R ed ing, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your s ide
Madam President, I too would like to w arm ly thank the rapporteur, G ra a M oura , and Commissioner R ed ing, for their contribution to the cre ation of this programme
The C ulture 2000 programme was final ised at the end of last year as a result of con ciliation between Parliament and the Council
The out come can be considered reason able , when we take into account the fact that the adop tion of the programme call ed for a un an im ous decision to be made in the Council
We have to hope that at the forth coming IGC we will also end up with qu al if ied majority decisions in the area of culture
It is really str ange that legislation that ad her es to the cod ec ision procedure when it is being deb ated requ i res un an im ity for it to be pass ed in the Council
The framework programme on culture is rep la cing the present K al e id os c ope , A ri an e and R ap h a el programmes
When implementation of the programme begin s, I hope in particular that the scope it off ers for l iter at ure and the trans l ation of bo ok s can be u til ised to the full
I believe and hope that, despite the ass a ult on us all of the new techn olog y, l iter at ure will maintain its stat us
We need the dep th of spirit that l iter at ure provid es in the m id st of a culture that has a short attention sp an and is inc l ined towards the su per fic ial
L iter at ure like wise play s an important part in the way it trans mit s our cultural her it age , increas es m ut ual fam ili arity and pres er ves l ing u istic we alth and the di vers ity of t ong ues
In this connection , I am very g l ad to say that soon after the S oc r ates and C ulture 2000 programmes get under way offic i ally at the meeting of the Council of Minister s in Mar ch in L is b on , the country hold ing the presid ency of the EU is to organ ise a con ference to discuss the situation of public li b r ar ies
I hope that this con ference will also encoura ge the Commission to take the issue of li b r ar ies into active consideration in the f if th framework programme in respect of the information soci ety
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, some h ow or other , today ' s agenda has come full circ le
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values , about to ler ance, human di gn ity , human right s, a positive approach to the enlargement proces s, transparency and respect for each other
You th , e du c ation and cultural policies are important to ol s for creating these values , for gi ving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it cre di ble in their e y es
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and e du c ational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s go als
C ult ural activ ity cre ates i den tit y
C ult ural activ ity is an exp ression of individ u ality , of an individual ' s own person ality ; it build s relations hip s and communic ates
We want a col our ful Europe
We want a Europe based on the principle of di vers ity within un ity
We want people to understand and le arn to app re ci ate differ ences
That is why we sp o ke in favour of b re aking down the budget , the alloc ation of funds that is, into the different ty p es of measure
That is why we opp osed conc ent ra ting he av ily on large net wor ks and net work structure s, because we want to promote the small and medium -si zed en ti ties and activities perf orm ed by individual s ; because we want to see th ous and s of f low ers b lo om
I would like to second what the previous speak er had to say
There is a contra dic tion in terms - un an im ity principle , cod ec ision procedure , and Con ciliation Committee - and it is one we must resol ve if we want to strengthen , and not further weak en the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European cons ci ous ness
Madam President, as we have he ard , all the groups have a common political en em y in the Council
It is not by ch ance that the Committee on C ulture ' s decisions are con st ant ly end ing up in the con ciliation procedure , for one or other Member State in the Council always hold s culture ho st age to other interests
In this way , the un an im ity principle has sh own itself to be a b l ock ad ing instrument of the first order
The b at t le for a work able comprom ise last ed al most two years, and now , at long last , the European Parliament can give the go - a he ad
The Council could not be mo v ed, not even when the prec urs or programmes K al e id os c ope , A ri an e and R ap h a el fin ish ed
A p il ot programme was call ed for to bri d ge the g ap
This show ed up the weak ness es of the European Union' s cultural policy activities once again
The political fight over funding and programme struct uring is out of all prop or tion to the vol u me of support
O ut of 4 1 0 applic ations in 1999 only 5 5 projects with a low over all vol u me of EUR 6 . 0 7 million could be considered
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to acc omm od ate Parliament to the t un e of even a single e uro !
And so the mod er ate su m of 1 6 7 million will stand until 200 4
That is the same as a single , medium -si z ed, German oper a h ouse ' s exp end it ure over the same period , when here in Europe this su m has been e arm ark ed for 2 9 countries over a period of five years !
There is a b l at ant disc re p an cy here !
And so we are going to have to be cont ent, al b e it very gr ud g ing ly, with the fact that we have at least man aged to achieve something in terms of cont ent
P re vious speak ers have already kind ly point ed this out
We can only hope that it will , after all, be possible to pers u ade the Council to have a change of hear t one day
P er haps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good , not harm !
C ult ural cooperation - and this was also mentioned ear li er - t ru ly cre ates i den tit y, far more so than any transport directive , how ever important it might be
Pro vid ing support for culture meet s with w ide -s p read accept ance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions
What , may I ask , is the Council a f ra id of ?
Madam President, who ever has the hon our , like myself , to ch air the Committee on C ulture , cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner R ed ing, with wh om he work ed and who , even during the con ciliation proces s, had difficult mom ents and opp osed the Council - you have he ard this said by everyone
I have no tic ed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organ is ational level has been firm ly ass er t ed, but there are few opportunities to address all the reques ts that the European States will make
I shall simply stress my own person al comp l ain t because , in the end , we did not manage to adopt a review cla use
However, Mrs R ed ing was certainly re cep tive and far si ght ed, and person ally undert o ok to review the issue and carry out a compreh ensive assess ment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation
The cultural programmes la un ch ed in years past - K al e id os c ope , A ri an e and R ap h a el - are being rep la ced by a single programme, C ulture 2000 , where - and I must stress this here very force ful ly - the rapporteur c ens ures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for ref le ction - as some one said this after n o on - but which still under l ines the h uge importance of being part of a v ast community where cultural inter p ret ation is a democratic fact or
This is not r h et or ic , but the new em b od i ment of a modern li beral ism which un it es the European States and constit utes a t ur ning point for the European Parliament and the Commission
We agree with this approach and despite the lack of fund s, this even ing ' s result will s erve to great ly bo ost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give r ise to an economic fact or and a grow th fact or ; culture then , and an institution al aspect , the basis for struct uring a v ast community , a pr ere qu is ite for economic grow th , and not the complete opp os ite , as Europe, in its cultural ha b it s, has perhaps been used to view ing things in the past
M an and culture are prior ities, and culture can result in economic grow th
Let us cont emp l ate this result , d eri ve satis f action from it and grant ourselves a l ic ence to fully em b ra ce this worth wh ile strategy
Madam President, may I first thank Mr G ra ç a M oura for we a ving his way through the rather to u gh te x ti les and f ib res that have made up this con ciliation t ap est ry
It seems to me when enter ing the con ciliation process for C ulture 2000 , having a po et to lead us in our end e a vour s is entire ly appropriate
Ag ain , because these con cili ations are not entire ly st ra ight forward , we have to thank V ice - P resid ent I mb en i for his ex emp l ary negoti ating s k ill s in the conv ol ut ed field of ens uring that cultural exp end it ure is w ise ly dep loy ed and given to us in our Community
The fundamental question , it seems to me , that fa ces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is : What is Europe ?
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the par am et ers of our national b ound ar ies ?
Europe is its people , its hist ory and now its colle c tiv ity ; but the reason why C ulture 2000 is so important to us is for this : I will w ag er that when we ask the question - ' W h at is Europe ? ' - we answer it by say ing, ' I t is our ar t , it is our l iter at ure and it is our her it age . '
That is what C ulture 2000 represent s
It represent s the possibility of sustain ing a European i den tit y in the tw ent y -f irst cent ur y, an i den tit y which es ch e w s the e ch o es of di vision , of w ar , of po ver t y, of opportunity , of po ver ty d ans la real it é
And more than this - and this is more pro s a ic , Madam President, it means that we have the ab ility to le arn from previous policy initiatives by put ting them into action in new programmes that are compreh ensive , that are cross -c ut ting and that benefit our cre ative industri es to the extent that they now require
It prom ot es mo bility , and it op ens the do ors of culture to the so cially dis ad vant aged and exc lud ed
My only regret is that in prom oting this programme we do not have su fficient money to mat ch our as p ir ations and ensure our ab ility to deli ver
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road
F o llow ing the con ciliation stage , our institutions can now form ally adopt the new ' C ulture 2000 ' framework programme
We shall th u s, in the course of the next five years, have a to ol perf ect ly su ited to develop ing clear , well - st ruct ure d and, I am sure , successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector
It is with great satis f action that I today welcome this ' h app y end ing ' in this House , and I thank you for it
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who work ed to achieve this successful out come to the con ciliation process
I should like to express espe cial than ks to the Committee on C ulture , You th , E du c ation, the M edi a and S port , particularly to its rapporteur, Mr G ra ç a M oura , its ch air man , Mr G ar gan i , the European Parliament de leg ation and the lead ers of the political group s, the Con ciliation Committee and its ch air man , Mr I mb en i
They all made a v ital con stru ctive and bal an ced contribution
Th rough out the negoti ations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasion ally t i res ome negotiations were non eth el ess comple ted in rec ord time
We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector , and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new pers pe ctive and to work to promote culture in a more compreh ensive , but also more th or ough and detail ed man ner
I would like to express my de light , with you, at this ple as ing out come . In sp ite of a budget situation which does not mat ch up to our amb ition s, these results will now en able us to approach the future positive ly and I would like to p ick up on what Mr G ar gan i has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a m id -term assess ment
It st ated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision , it would carry out an assess ment of the results of the programme, and this assess ment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial pers pe ctives
If need be , the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision , and this should be achie ved by 3 0 J un e 200 2
L adies and gentlemen, this is a form al commitment , not just words on p aper
All this must lead us to int en si f y our action in favour of develop ing a common cultural area , within which our cult ures can f l our ish further in all their un i q ue fe at ure s, in all their di vers ity , but may also be m ut ually en r ich ed and the other citizens of Europe may particip ate fully in them
It is thank s, too , to Parliament' s action , pre fer ring a number of small -s c al e measures to be carried out close to the citizens ' cultural ro ot s rather than v ast measures on a spe ct ac ular sc al e
This is going to lead us to make ' C ulture 2000 ' the programme of the citizen
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and p ra y for
I would like this participation to be as ext ensive and produ ctive as possible and I undert ake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years cover ed by the programme it bec om es a t ang ible reality
I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme particip ants so that all these small f low ers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a v ast mul tic ol ou red car pe t
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a fact or of en r ich ment for our citizen s, both in person al as well as in social and economic term s, but a right which it is our job to ass er t , and also the h all mark of red is c over ed inter action within the Union
This is what our European ' C ulture 2000 ' programme off ers
It does not compe te with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States. S uch policies are necessary , and I would like to see them develop ed further
It simply add s to them , comple ments them , build ing a bri d ge between the various cult ures of our various countries
I feel therefore that ext ending and en r ich ing European citizens ' participation in culture is a crucial task , one which jus tif ies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the y ard s tic k against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union
A number of Members of Parliament have quite right ly raised this point . If the Union is p ure ly an economic un ion , then it is a still b or n project
However, if it is a un ion of culture , civil isation and particip ation, then it bec om es a living thing
This is the found ation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop , and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration : first ly, provid ing cre ative people with opportunities of an innov ative nature to allow their t al ent to find the support it des er ves in our programme
Secondly, encoura g ing exch ang es, mo bility and training in the cultural sector
Th ird ly, prom oting cooperation between cultural oper at ors
F our th ly, increasing a ud i ences for culture , with particular emphas is on att rac ting y oun g people to culture and, f if th ly, prot ec ting the common cultural her it age on the European sc al e as well as the hist ory of the pe op les of Europe, and making them better know n
The new programme will , I am sure , in terms of its structure and organ isation based on transparency , efficiency and bal ance, pro ve to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures
Madam President, I re iter ate my than ks to Parliament for its support and for , once again , having sh own the importance it att ach es to culture in the context of the Union
I am certain that it will not be dis app oint ed, having given us its support , and I person ally undert ake to keep Parliament inform ed, as things prog res s, of the various p has es of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizen s, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union
Thank you, Commissioner . I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place at 1 1 a . m. tomorrow
( T he sitting was cl osed at 9 . 5 5 p . m. )
E nd -of- life vehicles
The next item is the debate on the recommend ation for second read ing (A5- 000 6 /2 000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on the En v ironment , Public He alth and Con s um er Pro t ection , on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adop tion of the European Parliament and Council Dire ctive on end -of- life vehicles [ 8 0 9 5 / 1 /1999 - C 5- 01 8 0 /1999 - 1997 / 01 9 4 ( CO D ) ] ( R a pporteur : Mr F l or en z )
Mr President, n ine million cars are sh red d ed and sc ra pp ed every year in Europe
E ven though they can no longer be d ri ven , these n ine million cars may still be tra d ed and mo ved ac ross b ord ers ; and not just int ra - C omm unity border s, but also those outside the Union
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these n ine million vehicles every year are to be recyc led and process ed
We believe that the directive has a few weak ness es that we in the House should work on to produ ce a directive which is g en u ine ly ground -b re aking
We therefore have a number of amendments
I person ally believe that the scope of the directive goes be y ond its objective
I do not think it is necessary for cl ass ic cars to be part of the directive
N or do I think that m ot or cyc les should be includ ed, as the dis tin ctive culture of recycling within the m ot or cyc le industry ob v i ates the need for a European directive in this area
I am not look ing for such r ig id ly high recycling qu ot as when it comes to special - p ur p ose vehicles either
I want special - p ur p ose vehicles such as amb ul an ces to have high rec over y qu ot as
This is my main concern in this matter
In my opinion, the directive solid ly regul ates the matter of account ability for how a car is disp osed of in Europe
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ens uring the appropriate colle ction points for dra ining cars
This will involve , for example, disp os ing of more than 3 2 million lot s of used oil , rem o ving b re ak f lu id , e t c
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used part s
What should we do with the sh red d ed product s ?
We should not over lo ok the fact that, although qu ot as are an important point in recycling and rec over y, they are by no means the only point
Do not for get that, in the case of car s, 8 0% of environmental imp act comes through d ri ving , 1 % through rec over y and 1 9 % through con struction
Q u ot as are not, therefore, the only par am et er in the matter of environmental comp a ti bility , just one of many
Of course we need to aim high , but qu ot as must not become an end in themselves
We must understand that the b ig g er p ict ure is important when it comes to the environmental imp act of cars
I am far k een er to see us move away from today 's car , we igh ing 1 , 4 00 k g and d ri ving an a ver age of 200 , 000 k m , to a future car cap able of d ri ving the same dist ance but we igh ing just 1 , 000 k g
This would at least mean 4 00 k g tim es 200 , 000 k m less transport ation
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large redu ction in C O 2 which, if I have right ly under st o od the K y ot o Pro t oc ol , is the important fact or
We therefore consider that, in future , vehicles which clearly and effective ly use light w e ight con struction m eth od s will produ ce less C O 2 and should rece ive pre fer ential treat ment in their comb us tion qu ot as
It should not be for each Member State , but for you and your sta ff , Commissioner, to dec ide whether these light w e ight con struction vehicles ( and there is also talk of 3 - l it re vehicles ) should rece ive pre fer ential treat ment
We think they should
M ay I say something about costs
S ome say that all the costs should be b or ne by the manufacturers ; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consum er
However, this can be serious ly question ed as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consum ers and ac qu ire for themselves a state -s an ction ed mon op o ly on recycling
I can only w arn you against cons en ting to this
There are amendments which propose sp l it ting the costs f i ft y -f i ft y between the manufactur er and the bu y er of a new car
The money from this po ol , system , or how ever you want to p ict ure it, would mean that from 200 6 all vehicles in cir cul ation could be taken in without cost to the last hold er
This too is a particular des ire of my group
Our proposal to sp l it the costs has a crucial adv ant age , namely that we w on ' t be an immedi ate c and id ate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted
The car industry is concerned about and h alf ex pe c ting rep erc us sion s, which is a serious problem which we must address according ly
This is why I propose sp l it ting the costs between the first hold er and the manufactur er
As for a ban on certain materi als : of course we need one !
A car has dangerous comp on ents which we must ban long -term
This means that we need a press ure instrument
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too str ing ent and we have come up with some al tern atives
There are a number of s ound amendments
This Parliament has been given more authority , so let us use it !
Let us have the c oura ge to put together a ground -b re aking directive
A directive which we put together just for the s ake of it would not be worth y of this House
I ask for your support
Mr President, I al most feel like say ing, " P he w " , now that we have at last come to the second read ing on this directive which has given us so much work , and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur, Mr F l or en z
I do not consider this directive to be at all satis fact ory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been ab and on ed and which, today, can only be rem o ved at local authority exp en se , i.e. the tax p ay ers ' exp en se
The principle of ' p o ll ut er pay s ' is not being appli ed
V ehic les already ab and on ed have also been ab and on ed by Community legisl ation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the text s on em ission s or in this text on end -of- life vehicles
The only m er it of this directive is that it look s to the future
It has not, however, been possible to s ol ve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recyc le
On the other hand, we can be fa ir ly confid ent for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find ( a ) materi als that are e a si er to recyc le and ( b ) to set up recycling industri es
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flex ible approach to recyc l ing, re use and inc in er ation, as far as the new particularly light materi als are concerned which make it possible to redu ce vehic le cons u mp tion and therefore em ission s
This is a problem of comp a ti bility between our dire ctives on end -of- life vehicles and the form er dire ctives , including the one on a ut o -o il , which we voted on a few years ag o
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the En v ironment , Public He alth and Con s um er Pro t ection , on having the w is d om , in order to make things perf ect ly clear , to re int rodu ce the cla use making an excep tion of the v int age cars which are part of our industri al and cultural her it age
In conclusion , let me say that this directive is not amb iti ous enough to s ol ve the problems of present car number s and it is rather h y p oc ri tical with regard to the f ate res er ved for the w re c ks which still cl ut ter our fore st s, l akes and g ard ens
On ce again , the principle of ' p o ll ut er pay s ' is not being appli ed. The tax p ay er is still fo oting the b ill
Mr President, Commissioner, read ing the le a f le ts which have been dist rib ut ed in recent week s, one would think that we were talking about the u l tim ate environmental c at ast ro p he or the de ath of the car industry in Europe
N e ither is correct
We simply must real ise that the directive on the t able is a s ound directive
It means ec ological progress for Europe, and we can be p rou d of ourselves if we suc ceed in en ac ting it and set ting it in motion
All the same , there is one point on which we are in conf lic t
In the g rand sch e me of the directive , it is perhaps a min or point , but never thel ess a disp ut ed one
It concerns the issue of recycling costs
H ere we find ourselves fund ament ally at o d d s with last year 's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last own er and the issue of finan cing were l u mp ed together and a question mark pla ced over whether the last own er should really be free from costs
L ast F e b ru ary in this House we un am b ig u ous ly decid ed ( and we Social Dem ocrat s are s tic k ing to this ) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last own er is not open to question !
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disp osed of ?
For us this is st ra ight for ward : in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufactur er since this will also compe l manufacturers to design and build recyc la ble cars
And what about vehicles which are already on the road ?
Let us look at an example . R over in G reat B rit ain , if they were responsible for all end -of- life car s, would actually be responsible for 5 . 8 million cars within the European Union and would immedi ately have to set a side EUR 2 5 0 million against recycling cost s, where as a manufactur er from K ore a build ing sim ilar cars would only have to she ll out pe an ut s, as a represent ative of De ut s ch e B ank put it
S uch dist or tions in competition are not about environmental protection ; they simply affect invest ment potential and the jobs of those build ing cars in Europe
Con sequ ent ly, for end -of- life vehicles we propose set ting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end -of- life vehicles in order to saf eg uard the principle of freedom from costs
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars adv oc ate that manufacturers should pay the full wh ack and that they are not interest ed in the problem of dist or tions in competition when it comes to set ting a side funds
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from build ing cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be sec ure d in the future
I am in favour of str ing ent environmental require ment s, as you know from the a ut o -o il programme and the debate on ex h a ust em ission s, but I believe that they should be the same for everyone !
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive
Firstly, because it clearly sti pul ates the environmental objectives
Secondly, because it can promote recyc l ing, which is important
Th ird ly, because it set s out a clear procedure to combat po ll ution caus ed by he av y m et als
This is also an important point
The directive aff ord s a European framework , also to Member States who already have system s in place and who wish to continue to use these
So , first of all, we need to keep the recycling per c ent ag es at their present level . This will , of course, provide the necessary inc en tive for techn ological innov ation and for i d enti f ying way s of deal ing with materi als that we do not as yet know how to disp ose of
Secondly, we need to re tain the detail s as they are included in the common position
As from 200 6 , therefore, all vehicles should be hand ed in at no cost to their last own ers
N e ed less to say, this is most defin ite ly an essential point which should not be chang ed in any way
Is this too much of a b ur den ? There is, however, one thing we should not over lo ok
The directive appli es to complete car s, that is to say cars with n one of the essential comp on ents mis s ing. A cc ord ing to the exper t s, few of these complete cars are of no value
A fter all, recycling and the re - use of comp on ents form part of a sector which is not necess arily l os s -m aking
Q u ite the re ver se , in fact . At present , there is a whole ra ft of companies which make a living out of them , and a dec ent one at that
This directive encoura g es the whole of this sector . It is a sector which comp ris es small and medium -si zed business es
S ince , in this case, transport costs are high , a system will have to be introdu ced which will need to be very much dec entral is ed, because transp or ting an end -of- life vehic le over a dist ance of more than 1 00 k m is not a pro fit able activ ity
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to hist or ic vehic l es, and I think we o u ght to add this provision to it
I think , therefore, that v int age cars o u ght to be ex emp t
Al so , it is a good thing that we should clearly l ay the b ur den of responsibility with the manufactur er. That is a basic principle which we must up ho ld
As manufacturers are responsible for the design , they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the con cep tion ph ase
We must also ins ist that the cost is b or ne wh ol ly or large ly by the manufactur er, as sti pul ated in the common position
I find this a well -b al an ced form ul a which does not prec lud e a number of other things
I think we need to re tain it
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not al ter its ess ence
A fter all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about , and that it was a very difficult bal an cing act to reach this common position
In my opinion, we should not j e op ard ise that common position , because it is a directive which we des per ately need for environmental reason s
I would ask you to support this common position
Our group will , at any r ate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reason s and because we have this directive which is well -b al an ced and en com p ass es a whole r ange of issues and difficulties includ ing, for example, the way in which the costs are to be dist rib ut ed
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today
Do es this European Parliament support the ec ological principle of manufactur er ' s liability , that is to say that car s, once they have reached the end of their li ves , are the responsibility of the car manufactur er ?
No , according to the Ch ris ti an Dem ocrat s in Amendment No . 3 8 : car manufacturers and car d ri vers should sp l it the cost 5 0 / 5 0
It is e vid ent from the p ack ag ing directive in which this 5 0 / 5 0 comprom ise is included that this does not work
P ack ag ing still account s for a m ount ain of r ub b ish in Europe and is a b ur den upon the environment
S ome of the social ists under the dire ction of Mr B er nd L ange say : y es, we appro ve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2 01 0 or 2 01 2 according to Amendment No 4 5
The common position sti pul ates 200 6 . A cc ord ing to the group of the G re en s, this gi ves the car industry a mp le time to make the necessary prepar ations
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 3 8 of the Ch ris ti an Dem ocrat s and Amendment No 4 5 of some of the social ists
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their car s, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re - us ed more e a si ly and more ch e ap ly
The problem of pl as tic and P V C will then no longer exist in cars and these product s will be rep la ced by pl ant -b ased b i op l as tic . This is u l tim ately ch e ap er, also for the consum er
For tw ent y years, the majority within Parliament has attemp ted to make European environmental policy gre ener
T od ay , this gre en position is being threat en ed under press ure from , in particular , the German and French car industri es
That is why I urge you to vote against Amend ments N os 3 8 and 4 5
We , the G re en Group , by and large support the common position
Mr President, the w ast e from end -of- life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the qu an tit y of w ast e and of em ission s of environment ally ha z ard ous substan ces
We in the Con f eder al Group of the European United Le ft / N ord ic G re en Le ft therefore want as compreh ensive and cons ist ent a set of regulations as is human ly possible in this area
With this directive , we have the ch ance to take a b ig step forward , but this pres u pp os es that the Council ' s position is not to r n to sh red s and weak en ed in Parliament' s read ing of it
If they were adopt ed, many of the amendments which have been tabled would consider ably weak en the directive
This appli es, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Party but also , unfortun ately, to some of the amendments from Mr L ange , as I see it
It is e as y to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in German y, w ent in for some pre t ty to u gh l ob b ying before the present directive was adopted
For ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply
The po ll ut er should pay
This means that it is the manufactur er which should take full responsibility , financial as well as other wise , for recycling vehicles
There must be rules govern ing existing vehicles too
Wh ere this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weak ening of the Council ' s position regarding the d ate from which the regulations are to come into force
There should be no fall ing -o ff in the per c ent ag es concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substan ces such as lead
We shall vote against any amendments which run c oun ter to these consider ations
If those amendments were adopted which would consider ably weak en the directive , this would be very det ri ment al , not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s cre di bility on environmental issues
R e ference was made ear li er on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the million s of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industri es, for example my own country , S w ed en
I was myself a car work er before I was elect ed. I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have st o od b es ide a produ ction line and as se mb led cars
I think that very to u gh demand s should be made of the car industry . These would , of course, be to the adv ant age of modern , prog res sive car manufacturers who think in environment ally f ri end ly terms
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encoura g ing in the European Union
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe
There is no doubt that ab and on ed cars represent a serious threat to the vis ual and ph y s ical environment
Our citizens expect us in this regard to prot ect their interests
E ach year , there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles sc ra pp ed within the European Union
This in itself gener ates a large amount of w ast e
C ar manufactur ers, the supp li ers of materi als and equ ip ment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of ha z ard ous substan ces and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recyc led materi als can be used in the manufact ure of cars
We know that in the N ether land s there are author ised treat ment cent res in place to colle ct end -of- life vehicles and this process should be extend ed ac ross the l ength and b read th of the European Union
F rom an I r ish pers pe ctive , I know that the I r ish D ep art ment of the En v ironment is already having consult ations with m ot or industry representatives to ensure that appropriate colle ction cent res are put in place in Ireland in the ne ar future to deal with end -of- life vehicles
I see no reason why l ic ens ing ar r ange ments cannot be organ ised ac ross Europe for colle ction cent res to sc ra p the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disp osed of within the European Union on an ann ual basis
C ar manufacturers will have to provide information on the r ate of re - use , recycling and rec over y of used cars which will be achie ved in the coming years
In accordance with new provision s included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 3 7 0 million consum ers within the European Union have a right to consum er - re l ated information
I believe EU consum ers will support those car manufacturers that incorpor ate the most environment ally -f ri end ly prac tic es in the coming year
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the v int age car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic consider ations
Mr President, the directive on end -of- life vehicles is certainly a m il est one in the improve ment of the environment in Europe
I also think that a great effort has been made to ar ri ve at int e ll ig ent recycling of materi al s, a redu ction of po ll u ting w ast e and the prom o tion of techn ological innov ation
In this regard , we are certainly on the right tra ck , but as some Members have already stress ed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers ' responsibility will become a sh ared responsibility
I would like to say that in It al y, consider able he ad way has been made in this sector ; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encoura g ing us to take end -of- life vehicles off the market , but in our country the a ver age a ge of cars on the road is rather high , and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could ent ail for the market
We need to con du ct a serious analysis of the matter
In It al y, we have be g un to with d ra w and recyc le a round 8 0% of old car s, but there is a market problem which could t ri gg er a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in It aly industry often res ort s to l ay -o ff s and red und an ci es - and cause problems for work ers in different part s of It aly
We must therefore tr y to recon ci le the two requirements - Parliament is some tim es a little extre m ist , adop ting posi tions that are either extremely pro - g re en or extremely anti - g re en - and, all things consider ed, find a way to comb ine the effort made by Mr F l or en z and that of other Member s, who are tr ying to recon ci le the two posi tions as best as possible
These worth wh ile amendments are the out come of this ; I think that we will be able to ar ri ve at a solution to the problem , that is, to recon ci le environmental requirements with market and l ab our requirements
Mr President, this directive deal s with the comp ar ative ly small but grow ing problem of ab and on ed cars and the question of a more structure d disp os al of all cars at the end of their life
To that ext ent, it might be thought des i ra ble , even if it is not a matter of urg ent necess ity
The key questions now are who pay s the EUR 2 6 2 per car for the 9 million cars that are disp osed of each year ?
Wh o pay s for the colle ction , the dis m ant l ing, the disp os al and so on ?
And should the directive be ret ros pe ctive to cover every car that has ever been made ?
The proposal from the Council, the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot
That would mean b illion s of p ound s or e uro s for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union
That cost would in e v it ably be pass ed on to the pr ice and h ence to the bu y ers of new cars
B ec ause European car manufact ures have been oper ating here for man y, many more dec ad es than companies from J ap an , K ore a and else wh ere , that would be a much greater b ur den on the old er European companies and a competi tive gi ft to their compe tit ors from else wh ere
I comm end Mr F l or en z , Mr L ange and others who have s ought from both s id es of the party di vid e a comprom ise based on sh ared costs
I also comm end to you the amendment stand ing in my na me and colleagues from German y, It al y, Ireland , S p ain , S w ed en and B rit ain , to rem ove the ret ros pe ctive nature of this measure
R et ros pe ctive law is b ad law , it is un f air law and often it is un work able law
M ost democratic parliament s in the free world reject it on principle un less there is over wh el m ing public interest , which clearly there is not in this case
That is why I have call ed for a ro ll -c all vote on this
We can see who is prepared to vote for a ret ros pe ction which is of doubt ful leg ality , which would be a cost ly b ur den to every future car bu y er and a dev ast ating b low for the European car industry
Mr President, once again I would like to brief ly out line the economic issues involved in this directive , and re a ff irm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleag ue , B er nd L ange . These amendments actually have the adv ant age - and I should like to stress this - of recon cil ing environmental con st ra int s and economic imp er atives
The Council ' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part , of the costs of rec over y and recycling
But , as Mr L ange so right ly said, this solution is tot ally un f air to European car manufacturers
C om ing from a country which does have a car manufact uring industry , I can tell you that it is not possible , ret ro ac tive ly, to imp ose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road , i.e. effective ly making them bear the costs ar ising from 8 0% of the total number of cars in Europe
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demand s we are making of them today into their manufact uring proced ures and their manufact uring costs
The common position put s European car manufacturers in a dis ad vant age ous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market
Of course, we are not here to def end a particular national interest or a particular industri al l ob b y. We are here to build a Europe that is competi tive on the world market and to saf eg uard jobs in economic sect ors where we are actually competi tive
This is wh y, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by B er nd L ange . These amendments will be support ed by the Group of the Party of European Social ists since they effective ly recon ci le all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental con st ra int s - while gr an ting Member States the freedom to se lect the means to implement these con st ra int s, since these amendments env is age that the system s in place in the Members States, and some of them work perf ect ly well , will be able to continue to oper ate
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end -of- life vehicles before us today aim s first ly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to saf eg uard the proper oper ation of the internal market in this sector
Let me brief ly say that hist or ic and v int age vehicles must , of course, be ex emp t from the scope of this directive . C ar s are also part of our cultural her it age
I think we would all agree on that. Ha ving said that, one of the st um b ling b l oc ks concerns Article 12 , i.e. the d ate on which the directive will come into force
Parliament' s proposed solution of 1 8 months following the directive ' s ent ry into force , for new vehic l es, is not ter rib ly real istic
The European car population amount s to several t ens of million s of cars which will have to be rec over ed even though they were not design ed for recycling
The common position was more fe a sible since it env is aged 200 6 for vehicles already on the road
This would , further more, make it possible to allow f ir ms time to make funds available to meet these addition al exp ens es
Li ke my group , I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel , off ers a bal an ced comprom ise between con st ra int s upon f ir ms and essential adv an ces in environmental protection
Mr President, the European Parliament is today fa cing an important decision
W ill we give our back ing to forward - lo ok ing environmental and consum er protection or , as the amendments of F l or en z , L ange and others cause me to fear , will we allow ourselves to become a serv ant of the German car industry ?
The cre di bility of Parliament as a ch amp ion of environmental protection is at st ake
It would be sh a me ful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the prof ession s the governments of the 1 4 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufactur er responsibility and environmental protection !
The intention of F l or en z and L ange in their amendments is obvious : to sa b ot age the directive !
The proposed sh ared responsibility would under min e the po ll ut er pay s principle and det ra ct from product innov ation
In set ting up num erous h ur d les their so le aim is to ha mp er an effic ient ec ological materi al f low policy and by going down the road of type appro val s they seek to delay the implementation of the dire ctives by 12 years or more
This is tot ally unacceptable
I therefore appe al to the German de leg ates in particular to prevent major political damage occ urr ing today !
The red - g re en f eder al government has not exact ly cover ed itself with g l ory in the debate on the E nd -of- life V ehic les Dire ctive
Do not continue in this v e in !
The wh ing ing about competi tive dis ad vant ag es is l au gh able if it only concerns competi tive dis ad vant ag es sustain ed by the German car industry
St art rep res en ting your people and not just your car manufacturers !
V ote in favour of environmental and consum er protection and for innov ation in the car and recycling industry !
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997
It is high time that we reached an agreement
S ince I more or less share the views of my colleag ue , Mr S j ö st ed t and the represent ative of the G re en s, Mr de R o o, I am not going to use the two min utes all ot ted to me , and I will high light just two issues
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal , the ide a, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of w ast e, that we should use materi als which will sub sequ ently cause less po ll ution
A not her point is that w ast e should not be inc in er ated or c r us h ed, not only in the case of lead , c ad m ium and m erc ur y, but also in the case of w ast e which contain s P V C
Parliament is currently discuss ing this issue in another context
The other question is who should bear the cost
I agree with previous speak ers who have said that the po ll ut er should pay , and this proposal express es that idea very well
Pro du c ers must pay - although we all know that the consum er will u l tim ately su ffer the consequ ences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 200 6 , as some of the amendments propose
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first read ing
It is also important to set per c ent ag es and a d ate for vehicles to be comp osed of recyc la ble materi als
I believe that this proposal re lies on very long de ad l ines
L ast ly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the cre ation of small and medium -si zed business es which, if subject to r ig or ous appro val and d u ly author is ed, can promote the cre ation of jobs in this very important area , pre ven ting the em erg ence of mon op o lies by large companies
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real respon sib ili ti es. We have to work out what we are going to do with the million s of vehicles we ab and on each year
In some of our Member States, vol un t ary environmental agreements have already been sign ed to ensure that our d it ch es, can als and field s are not f ill ed with these u g ly and dangerous w re ck s, in h ab ited occasion ally by an al arm ed farm y ard ch ick en
I come , of course, from a country that is p rou d of its car industry and of its comm er cial success both in Europe and in third countries
I can g au ge its importance for my country ' s international rep ut ation
I know of the pro ac tive at tit ud e of the European car manufact uring industry which has set up an ext ensive research programme to out line a national information system for dis m ant ling end -of- life vehicles
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experi en ced in find ing a comprom ise
That is wh y, today, we must be understand ing al ch em ist s, concerned for our environment . This will either be the cent ur y of w ast e management or it will not
As far as I am concerned, at least , the principle of ' p o ll ut er pay s ' must be appli ed
The car industry , increasing ly more respect ful of the environment , has , I am sure , anti cip ated this kind of increasing aw ar en ess
Inde ed it is ac cep ting its respon sib ili ties
It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive , and let us be w are of going into too much detail because the industri al tra dition s, the dem o li tion and c r us hing sect ors v ary according to whether you are in It aly or in Fin land
I am opp osed to making the car own ers li able
The m en and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their c at aly tic con ver ter , pay their national tax es and the tax on f ue l and are therefore already pay ing a high pr ice for their m ag n ific ent m ach ine and their freedom of movement
It would certainly be un wise for my fe llow Members in the major groups of the f eder al ist t end ency to seek to make the European Parliament un p op ular in this way by creating a liability sh ared between the own er and the manufactur er
How , further more, can a fund be creat ed which will pay for vehic le recycling and manage oper ations within Europe
Wh o is to pay for recycling the car I b ought in France if I reg ister it in B el g ium ?
Wh ich national fund will pay for my end -of- life vehic le ?
Let us be w are , too , of wor ry ing the world of business with the legal un c ertain ty of an unacceptable ret ro ac tive application
It is not our intention to start a p un i tive legislative c amp a ign here today, but to continue on our present course, adv oc ating sustainable development
Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spe ar he ad ed by environment comm itt e es, does its very best to make a cri tical assess ment of the proposals sub mitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view
N ow , a s ound common position sub mitted by the Council is in dang er of being chang ed for the wor se from an environmental point of view here in Parliament
E ver y year , we disc ard a h uge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substan ces
This is why it is important to prevent w ast e materi als
We should also aim for min imum qu an ti ties of he av y m et al s, as well as of other dangerous substan ces and materi als
In addition , car manufacturers need to produ ce and build these cars in such a way as to fa cil it ate simp le dis m ant ling and re - use
What is left of the st ri pp ed vehic le also requ i res to be process ed ad equ ately
I therefore welcome with open ar ms the per c ent age level s for re - use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council
These day s, the complete dis m ant ling of end -of- life vehicles is economic ally vi able. This means that we move away from sh red d ing
The pres c rib ed objectives are most certainly vi able and, in the N ether land s, a value of 8 6 % recycling has now already been achie ved
The best way of achie ving proper colle ction is to ensure that the last hold er and / or own er can deli ver the car to an author ised treat ment fa cil ity without any cost
The process ing cost can then be incorpor ated in the pr ice of new cars
The proposals made by a few M E P s imp act great ly on this system
The so -c all ed sh ared liability is very c um ber s ome and does not sti m ul ate innov ation
If the system of deli ver ing cars to treat ment fa cili ties without any cost is appli ed, it will also transp ire that the cost of process ing will come down consider ably
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the ear li est opportunity
A l ab or ious con ciliation procedure would ent ail an un n ecess ary delay , at the exp en se of the environment
Wh y cannot we just be satis f ied with the common position currently tabled ?
If we are , then all that remain s for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achie ved
Mr President, I hold Mr F l or en z in high est e em
He has deli ver ed excellent work under press ure both from his colleagues and from the car industry
A d d to this the fact that he had to do this from his gre en approach and, against that back g round , find a comprom ise . That was not e as y
O ver all , I am not dis s a tis f ied with the present common position and certainly not with the ph il os oph y under ly ing that common position . I would like to comment on two things
These should indeed be exc lud ed from the directive . Secondly, the cont ro ver si al question as to who bear s the responsibility for taking back cars
I do not wish to al ter the text of the common position in any way
The manufactur er is and should be li able and the last hold er and / or own er must be able to hand back the car without any cost
In my opinion, there is too much initi al h es it ation
The car l ob b y has l ed too many people up the g ard en p ath
I would also like to mention that experience has non eth el ess t au ght us that the process ing cost is in fact pass ed on
These costs are not very high
In the Member State where I come from , you are talking about 15 0 G u ild ers per car
If you ch arge this from day one , you can process the old cars st ra ight away
A very large industry might then em er ge which would ensure that sc ra p y ard s, which used to be a common fe at ure in our Member States, would then dis ap pe ar
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the comprom ise
I think it would be a good thing if we were to appro ve the present legislation together as soon as possible
This is positive because , in that way , the n ine million cars which are introdu ced each year on t o European road s will actually be process ed appropriate ly, and this will benefit us all
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it help s prevent our being fa ced with ha z ard ous w ast e from end -of- life vehicles and in so far as it prom ot es the re - use and recycling of materi als from sc ra pp ed cars
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using po is on ous he av y m et als should be fully implemented and that we should not redu ce manufacturers ' liability
If we do redu ce it, we rem ove from manufacturers the inc en tive to design and produ ce cars which give r ise to less w ast e
The common position , which was ar ri ved at with great difficult y in the Council, which the Commission has end ors ed and which was also maintain ed in Parliament' s Committee on the En v ironment , Public He alth and Con s um er Polic y, comp lies fully with the environmental requirements
I therefore find it inc om p reh en sible and very c ur ious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the En v ironment , Public He alth and Con s um er Polic y, the objectives of which are to weak en the environmental requirements and significant ly redu ce car manufacturers ' liability
If these amendments are adopt ed, I think that we shall cause Parliament serious ly to l ose cre di bility on environmental issues
So far , we here in Parliament have been positive c at aly st s for environmental protection but now , if the amendments proposed by Mr F l or en z and Mr L ange are adopt ed, we are to become a ne g ative fact or for the environment in Europe
What is more , if we redu ce manufacturers ' liability on this issue , this will also have serious consequ ences for sub sequ ent matters in other areas, for example the forth coming directive on sc ra p from comp ut ers and other elect ron ic equ ip ment
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we c ut ac ross party l ines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weak en environmental standards and redu ce manufacturers ' liability
We shall then be able to achieve an environment ally respect able result
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the d u mp ing of old car s, encoura ge recyc l ing, and above all encoura ge manufacturers to design cars which can e a si ly be recyc led
N ow who should pay the costs ?
Wh ate ver system is adopt ed, u l tim ately the cost will be pass ed on to the consum er
The best way of achie ving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for colle c ting the money and for disp os ing and recycling of the cars
The manufacturers have tr ick ed Mr F l or en z and Mr L ange into t abl ing amendments here which serious ly weak en these proposals
Do not be fo ol ed by the car manufacturers !
If you want the full benefit s of this directive use your vote to th row out these amendments
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate , cont r ary to what we may think
It has become e min ently political
Y esterday we hon ou red our institution with a political debate
T od ay , if 3 1 4 Members of Parliament y ield to the strength of the l ob b ying of some car manufactur ers, we should be doing ourselves dis h on our
In ex pe c ting consum ers to bear h alf the cost of the rec over y of end -of- life vehic l es, as Amendment No 3 8 sti pul ates , even though the common position states that all rec over y costs should be b or ne by the manufactur er, Parliament would , for the first time, not be ac ting as the def ender of the rights of the consum ers and citizens of Europe, it would be t ur ning into mere s ound ing bo x for different l ob b ies
We cannot accept this. It would be a pre ced ent which would open the do or to all s ort s of press ure in many other areas
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weak ening a Council position , where as us ually we are comp l ain ing that their position is not strong enough
The free rec over y system , for example, for old vehicles and ra ising the per c ent age to be recyc led will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this gener ates according ly
Th u s, for the consum er, for the environment and for the new jobs to be creat ed in recyc l ing, the Council ' s common position defin ite ly must not be amend ed. It is, as it stand s, perf ect ly accept able
Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure
This is a use ful measure and it is one which we all need
M ost of the technical issues have been resol ved
There are some detail s to be final ised but most of the technical issues have been resol ved
We have ar ri ved at the final question
In the first read ing debate it was only the E conom ic and Mon etary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draft s man of the opinion of that committee who pos ed that question in Parliament
That is quite simply : Wh o pay s ?
The Council common position reached a reason able comprom ise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it as Mr B ow is has m ist ak en ly said
In fact perhaps as little , the law y ers tell us, as 2 0% or one -f if th of the cost
That is not un re as on able
If you look at the U K consum er for example, who bu y s a R over , as Mr L ange has indic ated or for that matter any other make of car in the U K and who has for years been pay ing ex ces sive pr ic es for those car s, over and above comp ar able pr ic es in other part s of Europe, why should they pay ?
They have pa id already
Wh y should the very same people as tax p ay ers or as future car bu y ers, pay again to disp ose of the vehic le that the manufactur er has made the pro fit from ?
I cannot accept that
There are amendments here today that are propos ing that should be the case
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it
The responsibility for these cars li es with the manufactur er
It is the manufactur er who has to provide the inf ra st ruct ure and provide a reason able part of the cost of disp os al
The common position does not prec lud e the possibility of contribution s being made by government
The common position is a reason able comprom ise
S ome of the amendments today are tot ally un re as on able in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufactur er of pay ing a little if any of the cost of disp os al of cars on the road
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the tax p ay ers and the consum ers of Europe I am voting against those amendments
Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will proper ly deal with end -of- life car s, although in this inst ance the Council has not provided a mod el for a su it able European environment policy
It is dis gra ce ful the way in which the German Presidency hand led this matter
Firstly, H er r T rit tin , the En v ironment Minister , was not in t un e with his colleagues in the C ab in et , then Ch ance ll or Sch r ö der b lu nder ed in like a b ull in a ch in a sh op , having no exper t know ledge of this process
M ind you, even the R es olution of the Fin n ish Council Presidency in J un e was not the best result that could have been done achie ved
There are certain weak ness es, the gre ates t of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small business es ; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies
It is in the area of supp ly that small business play s an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employ ed in small and medium -si zed enter p ris es
For there are consider ably more than two million people employ ed in this sector
The p light of small business es is also address ed by num erous amendments from the Committee on the En v ironment , Public He alth and Con s um er Polic y and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs
The common position is also no great sh akes from an environmental view p oint
It fail s to take in the b ig g er p ict ure and when my fe llow de leg ate from the G re ens say s that this is the first time that the European Parliament has t on ed down a common position , I really must ob ject , because quite simp ly, it is not environment ally mean ing ful to restric t the use of modern , low - con s u mp tion cars such as the 3 - l it re car , which contain a great deal of pl as tic , by means of r ig id , high recycling qu ot as !
Con sequ ent ly, we must support an amendment which at least per mit s excep tions in the case of particularly economic al cars
The objec tions of the industry in this matter are certainly not without found ation
However, the argu ments of the pl as tic s and car industri es would be more pers u a sive if a commitment were to be given to redu cing C O 2 level s in Europe in other sect ors b es id es these
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very r are situation : those who wish to up ho ld environmental values will take the s ide of the Council in their common position
In contra st to what the previous speak er said, I can say I am really p rou d that a common position was achie ved during the Fin n ish Presidency to up ho ld environmental values
If we s li de away from the common position and tr y to di vid e the recycling cost s, we will be creating a lo oph o le : we will not have creat ed a r ational , clear system in which the di vision of respon sib ili ties is in order
That is wh y, in my opinion, the manufactur er must take the gre ates t share of the responsibility
On ly then will we find an ad equ ate solution to the problem , taking into consideration the fact too that the manufactur er should be encoura ged to make vehicles whose part s can be recyc led at the small est possible cost in the future
Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council ' s draft directive
The first concerns the manufactur er ' s un re st ric ted liability to take back end -of- life vehicles
There is the risk of creating a mon op o ly within the car dis m ant ling trade . This particularly appli es in areas within the EU where dist an ces are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dis m ant ling vehicles
I believe that, quite ap art from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU ' s dire ctives should not treat small companies within the Union un f air ly
Un re st ric ted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in dang er of creating a situation in which the market for used car part s dis ap pe ar s, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to se ll new part s
Y et the trade in used car part s is important , especially for those who colle ct and r en ov ate old er vehicles
The principle of un re st ric ted liability on the part of manufacturers is also d ub ious in terms of the principles govern ing the market economy
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the l at ter to be so ld and w ound up
They should be able to establish themselves in new market s, but also to le ave old market s
To b ind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time i ll accord s with a flex ible market economy design ed to promote development
The second principle in the Council ' s common position is the ret ro ac tive e lement in the draft directive
It conf lic ts with established economic and legal principles ret ro ac tive ly to imp ose upon a manufactur er financial liability for its product
To do so also changes the own er ' s liability ret ro ac tive ly. O ver the years, a consum er may have al ter ed the product in a number of way s
E ver y country within the EU now has rules govern ing the sc ra pp ing of cars
S ome may be better than other s, and some wor se
In anti cip ation of this EU directive ' s being implement ed, EU countries o u ght how ever to be individ ually li able for sc ra pp ing vehicles in the best way possible so that the ret ro ac tive e lement in the EU legislation is not appli ed
This does not conf lic t with a finan cing mod el invol ving the build ing up of funds
Mr President, everyone ag re es with the obvious environmental and industri al importance of the instrument in question
The common position off ers an accept able comprom ise but its rather de lic ate and prec ar ious nature some wh at restric ts the opportunities for improve ment , and put s the whole directive at risk
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be par ad o x ical for it to do so in the context of red ef ining the environmental scope of the instrument
I would remind you that car manufacturers have ad mitted that they can live with the directive ; the costs are not ex ces sive : recycling a car costs less than 1 % of the pr ice of a new car
M ore over , the manufacturers will not be finan cially account able until 200 6 , when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market. As for the remain ing vehic l es, we could never thel ess provide for some means of sh ar ing cost s, as is proposed in Amend ments N os 4 4 and 4 5 by Mr L ange , the only on es that seem comp a ti ble with the bal an cing of the common position and with the t ri als under way in some countries, and we should therefore support them
Mr President, this is an extremely b ad directive
First of all, as my colleag ue Mr B ow is has point ed out , it is ret ros pe ctive and that is wr ong in principle
Secondly, it d u mp s h uge costs on the European m ot or industry which would damage competi tiveness and damage employment
In this Parliament we con st ant ly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we con st ant ly pass measures which will have the effect of redu cing employment
I suggest to you that the directive is b ad in another respect , which has not been exam ined well enough in this debate
It is like so much European legislation
It is far too pres c ri p tive
It set s in st one one particular mod el of recycling
The produ ction line was inv ent ed about a h und red years ag o, I believe , by H en ry F ord and what we are propos ing to do here is to create a s ort of n in et e ent h cent ur y produ ction line in re ver se - to dis m ant le vehic l es, to take the p i ec es ap art and seek to recyc le them
One thing we should st op and think about is the fact that there is a very un c ertain market for recyc led pl as tic bu mp ers of cars
The pl as tic s industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economic ally do so
There is already a very successful industry out there which is sh red d ing car s, rec over ing m et als and rec over ing energy by the inc in er ation of the non- m et al lic part s
This is a very environment ally reason able approach
It is just as good environment ally to b urn old pl as tic as to b urn new oil for energy rec over y
This m eth od of disp os al of cars car ri es no cost and so would e li min ate the whole issue of who pay s because the " de ad " car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and rec la m ation process
I would opp ose this directive on the basis that it is too pres c ri p tive , it i gn ore s what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it set s in st one m eth od s which are not necess arily the best environment ally, and are certainly very dam ag ing economic ally
Mr President, the common position is s ound , but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end -of- life vehicles
The Social - D em ocra tic Group has sub mitted a few important proposals for improve ment over the past c ou p le of day s
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 4 5 , in which a ch o ice is made in favour of l ay ing the cost of dis as se mb ly and recycling at the do or of the manufactur er, for new cars at any r ate. Con sequ ent ly, consideration will also be given to recycling during the con cep tion ph ase and produ ction
For the cars currently on the road , it would be reason able to share the cost , for example by set ting up a fund such as that in the N ether land s
The common position sti pul ates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost , they should also take back end -of- life vehicles
This is a b ig problem in my opinion
I urge that car manufacturers should most defin ite ly not be given the task of organ ising the dis m ant ling and recycling of vehic l es, as they would g ain an ex ces sive hold over the second - h and comp on ents market
They would then deter min e their own pr ic es
An y one who has been in an old car know s that this is to the det ri ment of the consum er and the am ate ur m ech an ic
The European consum er organ is ation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point , is to my mind let ting the consum er down
A second argu ment for keep ing the dis m ant ling of cars out of the manufacturers ' cl ut ch es is the cost of transport
If car manufacturers all set up their own dis m ant ling compan ies, this will necess it ate transp or ting end -of- life vehicles over long dist an ces
This is environment ally un f ri end ly but also exp ensive and does not benefit the consum er either
I would therefore app re ci ate your support for Amendment No 4 5
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate
If you tra vel to the N ether land s, you will find that every last own er can get r id of his car cost -f ree
You will also find that these cars are su it ably disp osed of , that new materi al f low s have been open ed up in order to recyc le materi al s, that 8 5 % of the we ight of a car is recyc led and that 9 2 % of all cars in the N ether land s are recyc led
This is finan ced by a fund to which the bu y er of a new car contrib utes
S h ould this be con d em n ed ec olog ic ally, F ra u B re y er ?
I do not think so
The N ether land s has an ex emp l ary mod el for disp os ing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the bu y er of a new car should pay or , in the case of end -of- life vehicles currently d ri ving a round , the manufactur er, has nothing , absolutely nothing , to do with ec olog y ; it is a simp le question of competition !
The issue here is whether a European manufactur er should pay EUR 2 5 0 million or a K ore an manufactur er, say, EUR 2 million . In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition une qu al but, in terms of environmental protection , I want freedom from costs for the last own er, to be finan ced by a special fund , and manufactur er responsibility for new car s, which will force them to ass u me responsibility for build ing recyc la ble cars !
(A pp la use from the P S E Group )
Mr President, the proposal we are discuss ing has a h uge amount of adv ant ag es, main ly in the interests of pre ven ting w ast e and encoura g ing re - use , the rec over y and recycling of comp on ents and the rec over y of materi al s, e t c
I think we have tabled a s ound proposal
The main th read of the discussion is about whether or not the manufactur er, the v end or , or who ever, should take the end -of- life vehic le back without any cost
I will only give the example of my own country to i ll ust r ate how this system f un ctions there without any problems
We have reached an agreement with all the par ties invol ved. These include car manufactur ers, second - h and car deal ers, the f eder ation of the car industry , the m et al process ing firm s, sh red d ing f ir ms and the government
An environmental policy agreement has been sign ed on a vol un t ary basis
The car industry - and B el g ium produ ces a great many cars - did not have any problem with that
B el g i ans can deli ver their cars back to the v end or without any cost
In connection with this, we have no tic ed how - quite cont r ary to what has been said here to the effect that the sch e me would be to the det ri ment of employment - a number of small business es have taken the recycling of materi als to hear t and are doing very well
S ome business es have become h i - t ech business es, because they man aged to recyc le certain materi al s, even materi als which are not yet included in the directive
So this means that we are develop ing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a h uge favour into the b ar g ain
I am in favour of colle ction free of ch arge
It work ed for us
Wh y would it not work else wh ere ?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an inter es ting debate in which many important argu ments have been presented
W ould you be so kind as to bear with me for a few min utes
A llow me brief ly to comment on some of the ass u mp tions and principles behind the present directive
A llow me also to begin by comm en ting on and respon d ing to a c ou p le of the most important argu ments in this debate
First of all, I think I should repe at some of the basic fact s which Mr F l or en z and others have already mentioned
What we are discuss ing here is the fact that close on t en million cars are sc ra pp ed every year in the European Union, res ul ting in appro x im ately as many million s of t ons of w ast e
This means that al most t en million t ons of w ast e are creat ed by these car s, and appro x im ately se ven per cent of the l at ter are ab and on ed out in the open
M ore over , they constit ute environment ally ha z ard ous substan ces of the wor st kind
A pp ro x im ately t en per cent of lead produ ction is to be found in car s, but also c ad m ium , ch rom ium , m erc ur y and other very dangerous substan ces
This is something you already know , but I would non eth el ess also repe at it for the benefit of those who are list ening
C ar s are one of the fa st est grow ing sour ces of w ast e we have in Europe
We know that w ast e from cars ex ists and we know how we o u ght to be deal ing with it, and there is no ex cu se for not taking action
The present directive has three aim s
First of all, we want to st op he av y m et als from being used in the manufact ure of new cars
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufactur er is li able
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product ' s life - cyc le . In st ead , we should avoid creating so much w ast e
We should see to it that we recyc le as much as possible of the various cont ents of a product
Th ird ly, we wish to achieve the recycling objectives speci f ied in the present directive
These are the three most important aim s of the directive
This is, of course, because it is a w ast e of resources for us not to ensure that materi als in cars are recyc led
It is, above all, the manufactur er ' s resources we are was ting if we do not get to g ri p s with a car ' s life - cyc le
T w o important questions have ar is en in this regard . Y es, there are in fact more than two question s, but I want to mention just two of the most important
First of all : who should pay ?
And second ly : are we redu cing the European car industry ' s competi tiveness by means of the present proposal ?
The first question , then , is about who should pay
The directive states that the po ll ut er should pay and that the cost is to be b or ne main ly by the manufactur er in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU ' s treat y concerning the manufactur er ' s liability
It is non eth el ess clear that the cost will be b or ne joint ly by manufacturers and consum ers
We have c al cul ated that the cost of recycling cars does not constit ute more than one per cent of the pr ice of a new car
Do we im ag ine , then , that the cost would dis ap pe ar if we were not to adopt this directive ? No
C lear ly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment , but it will be very much greater
M ore over , the cost will have to be b or ne in the future
The cost will not therefore dis ap pe ar , but now we are cl ar if ying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be dist rib ut ed
A re we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis ?
Is it an un p ro fit able industry which we are discuss ing and which we really have to help by not imp os ing more tax es upon it ?
Is it the case that the car industry defin ite ly cannot aff ord these ?
Is it the case that the mo tives behind the proposed measures are in act ual fact concerned with redu cing the competi tiveness of the European car industry ?
No , of course not
It is quite the opp os ite . Do you believe that consum er demand for environment ally f ri end ly cars and more f ue l - e fficient cars is going to dec line in the future ?
What kind of requirements do you think our ch ild r en and g rand ch ild r en and future legisl at ors are going to make of cars ?
N at ur ally, that they should be environment ally f ri end ly, that they should be recyc la ble , that they should be f ue l - e fficient and that they should not po ll ute our environment
It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry
We must create for ms of mo tive power which are not dam ag ing to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the rele vant w ast e, recyc le materi als and compe te by means of environment ally f ri end ly and f ue l - e fficient cars
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great st ri d es more than proper ly comp ens ates for the fact that there are , in fact, a good many cars on European road s for which they must take responsibility
The cost is not ins ur m ount able ; n or is the task an imp os sible one
If we develop mo tive power of the kind I have des c rib ed, I am quite certain that market for ces and comm er cial interests in the car industry will ensure that m ech an is ms develop for deal ing with both the cost and the work lo ad . These will cons ist of every thing from ins ur ance to sen sible and effective sc ra pp ing and recycling system s
The industry itself will ensure that these system s are introdu ced in Europe
They will not represent an ins ur m ount able cost for the European car industry
They will inst ead help industry to be in the v ang uard of event ually produ cing environment ally f ri end ly and more f ue l - e fficient cars
We must do this for the s ake of the environment
The costs will not dis ap pe ar . N or will the w ast e dis ap pe ar
But , other wise , we must all of us, as tax p ay ers or citizen s, fo ot the b ill . What is more , the costs will be high er the longer we w a it before taking action
That is what I should like to say by way of introdu ction
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any ret ro ac tive legislation
If we ass u me that, on a ver age , a car has a life of ele ven years, do Member s, indeed does any one , believe that we should w a it for ele ven years before we get to g ri p s with this problem ?
Do you think that, when we legisl ate about ch em ical s, we should say that we are i gn or ing those ch em ical s which are already on the market and that we are legis lating only for what is to be produ ced in the future ?
C lear ly, we must consider the problem which ex ists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing r ange of car s. It is still not an ins ur m ount able problem
We can deal with it
We already have an inf ra st ruct ure . We have what we require in order to deal with end -of- life cars
I nat ur ally hope that the result of today ' s vote will be a good one
If I have not already done so , I would also thank Mr K ar l - H e in z F l or en z for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the En v ironment , Public He alth and Con s um er Polic y. In fact, it is in many respect s p ion e er ing work when it comes to re - use and manufactur er ' s liability
I believe it will have very positive and no tice able effects on the environment
We cannot continue to close our e y es to these matter s. As I have said, we have both the know ledge and the resources to co pe with these issues
A fter the first read ing in the European Parliament in 1999 , the Commission' s proposal end ed up in an aw k ward political situation in the Council
However, we ob tain ed a well -b al an ced common position in J u ly during the Fin n ish Presidency
N ow , we must ensure that the present legislative process is conclud ed successful ly
A total of 4 8 amendments have been tabled
The Commission can adopt 1 0 amendments in their entire ty
Th ree amendments can be parti ally appro v ed, and one can be approved in principle . C ertain amendments concern improve ments to the Commission' s proposal which we adopted as ear ly as at the first read ing or else they re int rodu ce into the directive such part s of the o ri gin al proposal as the Council has rem o ved
This appli es to Amendment No 5 , exc lud ing sec tion 1 ; 8 and 9 , sec tion 1 ; 1 0 and 12 , sec tion 3 ; 15 , 1 6 , 2 0 , 2 2 , 2 4 and 2 5 . These amendments can all be approved
Amend ments N os 6 and 2 1 are new ; the Commission can appro ve these
The Commission can also appro ve Amendment No 2 6 with certain e d itor ial changes
I want to emphas ise that a number of the other amendments aff ec ting the proposal ' s basic comp on ents involve a consider able water ing - d own of the level of environmental protection aim ed at by the common position . They cannot therefore be approved
Parliament has tra dition ally made a major contribution to strengthen ing environmental legislation in Europe. It would am a z e and dep ress me if it were not to do so today
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic p ill ar s of the present proposal into question
These concern , for example, the p has ing - out of he av y m et al s, manufactur er ' s liability and the require ment for recycling
I want to deal with these amendments on a group -b y - g roup basis
Amend ments N os 4 , 1 1 , 12 , 1 3 , 2 8 , 3 0 , 3 2 , 3 7 , 4 2 and 4 8 concern the p has ing - out of he av y m et als
Amendment No 12 invol ves a delay of at least t en years in bring ing the provision into force
Amend ments N os 1 3 , 2 8 , 3 2 , 3 7 , 4 2 and 4 8 involve introdu cing un n ecess ary conditions and excep tion s. This would mean that the process of rep la cing dangerous substan ces would be implemented more s low ly
Amend ments N os 4 , 1 1 and 3 0 mean that he av y m et als have to be s ep ar ated from the w ast e before recycling
The Commission con sid ers that the type of p has ing - out proposed in the common position is e a si er to apply from a technical point of view
Amend ments N os 1 7 , 1 8 , 2 7 , 3 4 , 3 6 , 3 8 , 4 4 and 4 5 rel ate to the manufactur er ' s liability
The comprom ise reached by the Council is fa ir but fra g ile . The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the bal ance without , at the same time, creating t ension s
I regret the conf u sion which a ro se rec ently due to internal docu ments from the Commission being wr ong ly us ed, so creating un c ertain ty about the Commission' s at tit ud e to the issue
I want to emphas ise that, as ear ly as 1997 , the Commission proposed a special cla use concerning manufactur er ' s liability and that the Commission entire ly support s the common position
This does not imp ose disp ro por tion ate costs upon manufactur ers. F ar from it
Amend ments N os 3 9 , 4 0 , 4 6 and 4 7 concern qu an tif ied objectives
The high level of protection aim ed at by the common position would be very much under min ed if the recycling objective for the year 200 6 were rem o ved
These amendments would also make the objectives aw k ward to deal with and difficult to superv ise
A llow me also - list en careful ly to what I am saying now , because I have he ard this re iter ated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of v int age and " ch er ish ed " cars as mentioned in Amend ments N os 3 , 7 , and 9 , sec tion 2 , and 3 5
S uch vehicles are not cover ed by the defin ition of w ast e and are not therefore included under the directive
So , wh ate ver has been st ated in this regard , v int age cars and m ot or cyc les are not included under the directive
We do not consider that Amend ments N os 2 and 1 4 add any thing to the directive
Amendment No 2 3 invol ves the Commission' s having to adopt quality standards for re us able comp on ents
This is not cover ed by the directive
An ad h oc directive should therefore be demand ed from the European Parliament and the Council
Amend ments N os 2 9 , 3 1 and 4 1 water down the requirements concerning the dis m ant ling of vehicles
There is a dang er of Amend ments N os 3 1 and 4 1 redu cing the ch an ces of recycling pl as tic , ty res and g l ass
Finally, the Commission cannot appro ve Amend ments N os 1 and 3 3 for reason s to do with legal cl arity ; n or Amendment No 1 9 , which the Commission con sid ers to be un n ecess ary at this stage
F urther more, Amendment No 4 3 does not fall within the directive ' s area of applic ability
Thank you very much , Commissioner
The debate is cl osed
We shall now proceed to the vote
V ote
Madam President, as you know , the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the num erous and serious trans l ation e r r or s, particularly in the French ver sion
You have received a let ter of comp l ain t from me about the number of m ist akes in this report and in other report s with which I have had deal ings rec ently
There is an e r r or which has still not been correct ed and that is on Amendment No 4
In the En g lish ver sion we refer to ph arm ace u tical and scientific organ isation s. In the French ver sion that bec om es ' ent re p ris es ph arm ace u ti ques e t organ is ations scienti f i ques '
C ould you ple ase make sure that French -s pe aking Members of this House know that the word ent re p ris es is not correct
It should not be in the amendment
And , again , I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of trans l ation that we are recei ving currently
Madam President, I would simply like to point out that during the procedure , we were not allow ed either to t able or , consequ ent ly, adopt amendments in the Committee
I do not know whether this is in order , and I would therefore ask you to ver if y the acc ur ac y of the procedure which was follow ed before this report reached the House
I have taken note of your comment , Mr S per on i
( P ar liament adopted the legislative resolution )
Report (A5- 00 1 8 /2 000 ) by Mr D im it ra k op ou l os and Mr Le in en, on behalf of the Committee on Con s titutional Affair s, on the con ven ing of the Intergovernmental Conference ( 1 4 0 9 4 /1999 - C 5- 0 3 4 1 /1999 - 1999 / 0 8 2 5 ( C N S ) )
( P ar liament adopted the resolution )
J oint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria
Madam President, we simply have a few trans l ation problems in this area too
We consider the En g lish ver sion to be the o ri gin al text
To give you an example, in both paragraph s 4 and 5 of the D ut ch and German ver sion s, the equ i val ents of the En g lish words : " in so far as " have been o mitted
This is why I would ask you to consider the En g lish ver sion as the o ri gin al ver sion
Thank you, Mr van V el z en
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs M c N ally just now
I am very concerned about these trans l ation problems which, unfortun ately, we seem to be having increasing ly, and I can ass ure you that we shall look into the matter very serious ly indeed
In any case, the author it ative ver sion is al way s, of course, the o ri gin al l ang u age ver sion
- ( F R ) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission en tit led ' W omen and S ci ence '
In this document , the Commission propos es to sti m ul ate debate with a view to prom oting the increased participation of women in research in Europe
This objective des er ves our total support
E x p end it ure on research and techn olog y actually for ms a si z e able part of the budget of the European Union, after agric ulture and the Structural Funds
The various framework programmes have en abled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innov ative cooperation between research ers in various Member States
R e lative ly few women , however, are active in scientific dis cip l ines despite the excellent results they achieve in their stud ies
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be under re p resent ed
I am therefore de light ed to see the proposals of the European Commission
The Commission document set s out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level , especially through the f if th framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obvious ly something I appro ve of
The go al for the years to come is to increase women ' s participation to achieve a r ate of 4 0% f em al e participation in the Mar ie C ur ie grant s, in consult ative as se mb lies and in e val u ation p an els for the whole of the f if th framework programme for research and technical development
In order to do so , it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sh ar ing of experience among the various Member States, to set up a coordin ating bod y to implement a ' W omen and S ci ence ' monitoring system within the f if th framework programme for research and technical development, speci ally responsible for g ather ing and dis se min ating sta tis tic s colle ct ed in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the r ate of women ' s participation in research activities
F urther more, like the rapporteur, I think that stud ies must be undert ak en to analy se the reason s for the g ap between the number of women with sci ence de g re es and the number of women who manage to have a care er in these field s
I mp ro ved analysis of the ob st ac les fa cing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to e li min ate those ob st ac les
We will have to enl ist the support of the many existing net wor ks of women scienti st s and to ob tain their assistance in fra m ing a joint research policy
The European Parliament will continue to careful ly monitor the implementation of the f if th framework programme for research and technical development as regards the prom o tion of women and to come up with ide as for the course of the f if th framework programme for research and technical development
We must incorpor ate the g ender fact or in sci ence, research and all other European Union polic ies, in order to put an end to the structural discri mination which prevent s women compe ting on equal terms in the l ab our market
In its communication " W omen and S ci ence " , the European Commission inform s us of its good int en tions of enl isting the support of women to en r ich research in Europe
This is very good , and we are pleased to see it
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union
We know that we can change this situ ation, in which women are under re p resent ed in the sci ence sector , only by means of a policy of e du c ational guid ance which will system atic ally encoura ge a greater r ange of care er ch o ic es for g ir l s and, when they have ob tain ed their de g re es, by means of positive measures at the prof ession al level
Ha ving said this, some of our fe llow Members clearly have qu al ms because the report by the Committee on W omen ' s Right s and E qu al O pport un ities which we have voted on contain s one point which may lead to conf u sion and is inter p re ted by some as a qu ot a sti pul ating that there must be 4 0% f em al e particip ating in research in Europe
This is p at ently not the case, since such a qu ot a would not be real istic
Inde ed the report does not mention the time limit for this qu ot a to be achie ved
To set my fe llow Members ' mind s at e ase and to reas s ure them , I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communic ation, undert akes to make significant efforts to increase women ' s participation in Community research programm es, which is, after all, a p ra ise w orth y go al
And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication sti pul ates specifically that it con sid ers a 4 0% min imum level to be a crucial go al for women ' s participation at all level s in the implementation and management of research programmes ?
It is not a qu ot a ! It is a perf ect ly leg iti m ate dec l ar ation of int ent from the Commission, in so f ar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States
The l at ter would be well adv is ed, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once , and make the same efforts in their own research programmes
Pe ople must real ise this !
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs M c N ally ' s report with a view to increasing and fa cil it ating women ' s participation in prof ession s in research and sci ence, m et with a fa ir ly w ide cons ens us
On this subject , any improve ment in bring ing the con cept of equal opportunities to bear in every day reality is indeed des i ra ble , and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contrib ute towards satis f ying the leg iti m ate as p ir ations of women : to en j o y equal access to scientific stud y, to ob tain posi tions of responsibility t ru ly in line with their results and compe t ence, and to have acc om p an ying measures dra wn up r ap id ly, en abl ing them to recon ci le their fam ily life and their care er
This necessary real istic and p ra g m atic policy, however, which will have to be as soci ated with the e li mination of the practical ob st ac les i d enti f ied as un ques tion able fact ors in this in equ ality must , as far as we are concerned, necess arily be based on the idea of comp lement arity , which is the only one cap able of jus tif ying a pro ac tive policy on the subject
Our think ing and our future actions must focus on res pe c ting these values , which t ru ly respect g ender differ en ces, not on some post ul ated se x ual equ ality , which has its own int r in s ic contra dic tion s. In any event there are no ground s for res or ting to the e as y op tion of a qu an tit ative policy, based on the use of qu ot as , cont r ary to the idea of citizens hip which the Members of Parliament in the U E N Group set great st ore by , and whose prob able consequ ences would be the opp os ite of the effect app ar ently s ought by Mrs M c N ally ' s report, namely women ' s participation in care ers in sci ence and research in prop or tion with their m er it
B y having the opportunity to show their true m er it , by e li min ating as far as possible the b ar ri ers as soci ated to the specific s of their condition as women , and not in the context of a conf lic t in which women seem to be att ack ing m al e priv ile ge , women will demonstr ate the benefit s to be g ain ed by fa cil it ating a situation where their prof ession al care ers may f l our ish . In this way they will suc ceed in al ter ing bal an ces which are still not in their favour
S ince the European Parliament ch ose to vote on a text that express ly res ort ed to the qu ot a policy which my report for an opinion had attemp ted to d en oun ce in no un c ertain term s, and in sp ite of the general approach which I appro ve for the most part , I can do no other than ab st ain from the vote on Mrs M c N ally ' s report
Second read ing of the F l or en z report (A5- 000 6 /2 000 )
Madam President, today in the second read ing we have voted on the amendments to the Dire ctive on end -of- life vehicles
I have reject ed the entire directive , not least because Amendment No 3 4 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5 / 4 have not received an ad equ ate majority here in the House
I come from a country which manufact ures 5 0% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free colle ction of end -of- life cars which is so finan cially on erous and unacceptable
H ere , in my opinion, the l ab our market is also consider ably b ur den ed by the costs ar ising to these companies
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mind ful of employment
I consider that this is a serious def ect and that, in principle , it does not be fit our legal system
In my opinion, this directive is unacceptable for this reason
Madam President, I would like to comment on the F l or en z report
I think that the vote has sh own that although the common position of the Council has been t on ed down , the major groups here ( and above all the German de leg ates of the major groups ) have not, thank G od , suc ceed ed in d est ro ying the hear t of the directive , namely manufactur er responsibility
Un fortun ately, there has been a t on ing down of the effective ec ological materi al f low policy, i.e. through the oblig atory risk assess ment of materi als whose harm ful effect on health has been know n for years
We know that lead , m erc ur y, c ad m ium and he x a val ent ch rom ium present high to x ic and health ris ks and num erous Community dire ctives have suc ceed ed in restric ting their us age without any risk assess ment being made
H ere , unfortun ately, the European Parliament has b ow ed to the interests of industry
I am never thel ess extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of F l or en z , L ange and others who have actually s ought to le ver out manufactur er responsibility and make consum ers so le ly responsible for the cost of environment ally comp a ti ble disp os al of end -of- life vehicles
I found this to be an extremely sh a me ful attemp t and I am pleased that it fail ed, that the attemp t by one large government and the de leg ates of a large Member State did not g ain a majority , by which I mean the attemp t to d om in ate the voting process of the European Parliament on ground s of the interests of its national industri es
Madam President, although I too have sp ent most of my life in fa st car s, I agree with my colleag ue , Mr F l or en z , that the directive on sc ra pp ing cars must make it clear that v int age cars are not included
These sp l end id cars do not constit ute w ast e
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments
N e ither can we f i x what the a ge for a v int age car should be as there are very great differ ences from one country ' s stat utes to another ' s
In this way vehicles of hist or ic value can be pres er ved for future gener ations
We cannot for get old car en th u si ast s e ith er, of wh om there are more than 5 0 0 00 in Fin land al one
They are involved in low - p ro f ile work of val u able cultural importance
- ( S V ) The parliament ary process concerning this question has been conf us ing, to say the least
B e fore the vote at the pl en ary sitting , new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee
In the di vid ed situation which has now ar is en, we therefore consider that the Council ' s word ings are the best
We need a directive in this area , and we also therefore want to avoid a comp lic ated con ciliation procedure
The directive concerning end -of- life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation
It is therefore important that the manufactur er ' s liability should be clear . This should not in any way be j e op ard ised
T od ay , Parliament is exam in ing, for the last time, this text on ' end -of- life ' vehicles and what is to be done with them : their d est ru ction , a comm end able intention with regard to our environment
There are , however, two consider ations which must certainly be deal t with within this text
First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this d est ru ction ?
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person , i.e. the vehic le own er, who pay s
He or she already pay s enough in tax es for this vehic le , which is a b ot t om less p it in financial terms
We have rec ently had cause to talk about the ' p o ll ut er pay s ' principle
We should apply this principle r ation ally and c al m ly, correct ly t ar get ed and without ide olog y
A not her essential point that must be included in this text is the express exc lusion of v int age vehicles from its scope
One might make the cla im that there is no need to state it exp lic it ly in w ri ting because it is an obvious point , but I feel that it is a point that should be made in w ri ting because there is every interest in adop ting clear text s
So let us vote for these amendments in order to pres erve these g em s of the a ut om ob ile industry
These old vehicles are t es tim on y to a culture and a p as sion which should be recogn ised and respect ed by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific i d enti ties
There is no lack of examp les among st European text s, and we all know how much debate and argu ment is caus ed by a lack of cl arity and prec ision
I only need to mention the case of Dire ctives 7 9 / 4 0 9 and 9 2 / 4 3
The precise word ing of text s provid es a guarantee and legal certain ty for those people who will have to apply or live by these text s on a d a ily basis
It is not the job of the M E P to gener ate li tig ation or legal proceed ings for jud g es in any ar en a
That would not be fulf ill ing our m ission
On the cont r ary , we must adopt c ry st al -c lear text s in order to limit legal disp utes

 ( N L ) That the F l or en z report has caus ed such a sti r has been pro ven by the power ful l ob b y m ach ine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement
I regret that the manufacturers have h ar ang u ed the European Parliament and the Council with a whole re am of argu ments which either c ut no i ce or were simply f al se
I d are say this because I to ok the t rou ble to go into the field and colle ct information from , among other s, sc ra p y ard s which already recyc le car comp on ents successful ly
They made it clear to me that the argu ments concerning lack of saf et y, for example, are non s en se
The car l ob b y was un s uc cess ful today and I am pleased about that
The directive remain s in place
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the recon ciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will t ri u mp h over un re as on able industri al requirements
- My party opp osed this measure and the proposed amendments
There are few things more certain in life than tax es, de ath and po ll ution
However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental dire ctives which have la ud able int en tions but which actually fail to achieve their st ated objectives
When it comes to po ll ution , like s in , we are all against it, but from there it is a far c ry from belie ving that just because a measure is proposed against this e v il it is necess arily good
In fact, this directive , like so many others address ing environmental issues , is not good
As is so often the case, it mere ly provid es yet another m as sive bureauc ra tic structure to control a problem , which will only s erve to create more jobs for official s, and cost the m ot or industri es and consum ers a great deal of money
The one thing it will not do is s ol ve the problem - it is a m as sive s ledge h am m er to mis s a n ut
No one , not least my part y, could begin to dis ag ree that recycling should be encoura g ed, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market , not to create another bureauc ra tic mon st ros ity
Th u s, a more appropriate way to encoura ge recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amount s of rec over able materi al in their vehic l es, to encoura ge priv ate sector recycling compan ies, through a p ack age of tax inc en tives and assistance on comp ly ing with environmental require ment s, and to inc enti v ise the use of recyc led materi als
Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any j ur is dic tion and n or should it have such j ur is dic tion
However, in the abs ence of these power s, it should not seek to sub s tit ute a less effective measure
In st ead , it should le ave Member States to develop their own system s, and avoid the t end ency to inter f ere where it is not want ed and can do no good
B erg er Report (A5- 000 7 /2 000 )
This proposal for a directive attemp ts to establish conditions for the pos ting of work ers who are third -c ount ry national s, for the provision of cross-border servic es. Th ird -c ount ry national s with a per man ent right of res id ence in one Member State do not en j o y the right to freedom of movement within the European Union
Un til now , the restric tions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non- C omm unity work ers have been very h ar s h
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of work ers within the European Union is being made e a si er, even when they are national s of third countries
N ever thel ess, the proposal for a directive mere ly aim s to allow them to move to another Member State when they are post ed there by an employ er based in their country of n orm al res id ence . This means that their scope for movement is limited to the d ur ation of their pos ting and only to the Member State to which they were post ed
This means that this proposal ' s fundamental aim is not to resol ve the problem of the restric ted movement of these work ers, but mere ly to improve the position of the companies provid ing services
On the other hand, for the s ake of simp li f ying proced ures some high ly deb at able amendments have been included in the B erg er report, one example of which is the establish ment of a common information service for card s iss u ed by a bod y in any Member State
B erg er Report (A5- 000 7 /2 000 ) and B erg er Report (A5- 00 1 2 /2 000 )
It is with the gre ates t satis f action that I welcome the two proposals for dire ctives intend ed to fa cil it ate the freedom of movement of work ers who are national s of a third country while fa cil it ating the freedom of movement of services
B as ic ally, these proposals introdu ce the EU service provision card which will in future en able al most 5 million third country national s leg ally res id ent in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a ph en omen on currently ob st ruct ed by problems such as the need to ob tain vis as and work per mit s
The first proposal for a directive will author ise business es established in a Member State which employ work ers who are third country national s to as si gn such employ ees to another Member State on a te mp or ary basis to provide services there
A cc ord ing to the terms of the directive , the employ er would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employ ee concerned
L og ic ally, in order to be given such a card , the employ ee must be leg ally res id ent in a Member States and must be cover ed by a social security sch e me
The second proposal grant s the same rights to s el f- e mploy ed work ers who are third country national s
Wh ile , basic ally, I sub s c rib e to the European Commission proposal s, non eth el ess there are some conditions which may lead to conf u sion
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur . This will make it possible to cl ar if y the terms and th us prevent any mis read ing !
O ther amendments are intend ed to simp li f y the administ ra tive procedure s, for example by author ising Member States to design ate a single authority responsible for iss u ing card s
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the s ort of administ ra tive un w ield iness which too often act s as a b ra ke on the proper application of new conditions
I can , therefore, only be de light ed at the adop tion of these dire ctives th us amend ed. We could not really to ler ate much longer a situation in which people leg ally res id ent within the European Union had to face so many problems
This goes against the fundamental principle of non- d is c ri mination ens h r ined in the found ing t rea ties of this Union
Mar in ho Report (A5- 000 3 /2 000 ) :
We have serious res erv ations about the Council ' s proposed amendments
How can we talk of increasing the sp h ere of compe t ence of the Court of First In st ance when we know that we need to increase the number of jud g es in that Court because it is over st ret ch ed ?
The first measure would in fact can ce l out the effects of the l at ter
S ome people will say that perf ection is not a real istic aim , but a brief look at the back g round should make our res erv ations more understand able to them :
On 1 J an u ary 199 5 , the Council w ent back on the decision to increase the number of jud g es la id down in Article 1 7 of the A c ces sion Treaty of 2 4 J un e 199 4
In M ay 199 5 , during the prepar atory ph ase of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the C F I , concerned about the pers ist ent increase in the vol u me of cas es, was already ins isting on the need to take measures ' w ith out which the Court would soon c e ase to be able to fully satis f y the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulf il its as si gn ed role . . . in conditions like ly to comprom ise the protection of par ties subject to t ri al . '
So what was done at Amsterdam ?
In that respect , nothing . On the cont r ary , ext ending the Community ' s legal compe t ence within the framework of the third p ill ar has increased the b ur den
You will agree , further more, that the text s adopted by this House always call for Community j ur is dic tion , and that includ es for the Ch arter of Fund amental Right s which is currently being dra wn up
The increase in the number of C F I jud g es from 15 to 2 1 and the opportunity it has rec ently been accord ed to have a single jud ge r ule on specific cases are not real solution s but mere dec o y s, gr ud g ing ly grant ed, which we have become aware of after the fact
Con sequ ent ly, these proposals do not live up to the issues at st ake . They represent a down ward spir al which in the long term would require the number of jud g es to be increased to several h und red
We cannot agree to this, since such a s id el ong sh i ft towards a Europe of the J ud g es is det ri ment al to the proper ex erc ise of democracy in our States
The time has come , we feel , for in - d ep th consideration of how to put the Community system of j ur is dic tion in order and to guarantee a f it ting quality of justice
This question cannot be deal t with s ep ar ately from the current think ing on the h i er ar ch y of n orm s and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity
Is the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference not the ide al opportunity for this ?
D im it ra k op ou l os and Le in en Report (A5- 00 1 8 /2 000 )
- ( S V ) The most important task of the approach ing Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the ac ces sion of the new Member States
We therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now gi ving the form al go - a he ad to the Intergovernmental Conference
We non eth el ess consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resol ved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place
We also argu ed this in No ve mber 1999 , and we would therefore refer to our expl an ation of vote of 1 8 No ve mber 1999
( F R ) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the con ven ing of the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference , the European Parliament call s for a " con s titutional process to be la un ch ed "
This deter mination to over ri de n ations with a leg ally sup r an ational text is also expressed in the first meeting s of the bod y responsible for draw ing up the so -c all ed Ch arter of Fund amental Right s, which is really a close t cons titution
It is expressed again in the un b e lie v able ex cess per pe t r ated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wish ed to can ce l out the result of the free ele ctions in Austria
The same deter mination to redu ce n ations to the level of mere administ ra tive regions is also e vid ent on every p age of the opinion iss u ed by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference
The key idea invol ves making qu al if ied majority voting the general r ule while mod if ying the cont ent of this qu al if ied majority to make it a dou ble simp le majority , of States and pe op l es, in order to increase the Commission' s ro om for man o e u v re and redu ce that of the min ority States
In cid ent ally, the French will prob ably be interest ed to le arn that the Commission is ask ing for Article 6 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amend ed in order to establish majority voting and cod ec ision with the European Parliament
Pe ople will re me mber that this ar tic le , deal ing with the trans fer of immig ration policy to the Community level , sti pul ated that for five years decisions would still be taken by un an im ous vote in the Council and there a fter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system
In Fr ance, both in the N ational As se mb ly and in the S en ate, when this was being ra tif i ed, many members of the French parliament were reas s ure d to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to ch o ose and could re tain un an im ous decision -m aking
We ll , today, the same Minister of European Affairs who d re w up the Treaty of Amsterdam , who has , in the mean ti me , become a European Commissioner, Mr B arn i er, propos es to dec ide , at the forth coming IGC , that the Council will oper ate in these areas by majority decision
This is the type of m ech an ism we are contin ually subject ed to when play ing the g a me of European integration with the Brus sels institutions
The French must be made aware not only that the purp ose of all these oper ations is to e li min ate their country as a responsible cent re for decision making , but that further more every means will be used to ext ra ct their cons ent
If they y ield , they are lo st . For it is their very means of def ence which are being e li min ated one by one

 ( D A ) The D anish Social Dem ocrat s have today voted against the report on the con ven ing of the Intergovernmental Conference
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be conclud ed before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remain ing form al ities, such as the we igh ting of v ot es in the Council of Minister s and the comp o sition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place ob st ac les in the way of the enlargement of the EU
We were therefore also very satis f ied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the H els ink i S um mit in De ce mber
An u nd u ly amb iti ous ext ension to the agenda at the present time would risk delay ing the enlargement process
That is something we do not want to see , and we have therefore voted against any such ext ension
We non eth el ess very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceed ing

 ( S V ) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the H els ink i Conference
P os sible future Member States o u ght to be involved in , and have an inf lu ence upon , the sh ap ing of the EU of the future
The ele ctions to the European Parliament in 1999 show ed perf ect ly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the no tion of an ever more f eder al ist EU cent red upon Brus sels
With the con ven ing of the forth coming IGC , the process of European Union is top ical once again
On ce again the discussion is going to be mon op ol ised by the H ead s of State and Government . In other words, f i ft een people are going to have discussion s and dec ide , behind cl osed do or s, on the f ate of more than 3 5 0 million individual s
It is therefore e as y to understand the public ' s lack of interest , given the con struction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them
In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC : the institution s, enlargement and European def ence
The fact is that the pri me concerns are the strengthen ing of ex ec u tive power , the development of clos er relations with li beral ism in the countries of East ern Europe and the re la un ch of the m il it ar isation of Europe, particularly by increasing m il it ary budget s
Social Europe, used as a fo il by the EU , has simply been e li min ated from the agenda
All this does is to leg iti m ise the development, on the European sc al e, of res ist ance move ments an x ious to bring in a social ch arter which would harmon ise work ers ' main cla im s towards the high est common d en om in ator
This is why I am voting against the report
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of con ven ing the IGC . I did so because it su ms up the ph il os oph y of the Portuguese Presidency , which is support ed by a broad majority in Parliament, of open ing up the IGC agenda be y ond issues str ict ly rel ated to red ress ing the bal ance of power between Member States, large and small , as was o ri gin ally st ated when the H els ink i Council was con ven ed
Un fortun ately, in the issues cover ed by the resolution s on future subject s for re vision s to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been st ated about the need to review Article 7 , which deal s with su sp ending a State in the event of a serious and pers ist ent vi ol ation of the " f ound ing " principles of the Union, as la id down in Article 6
As the present crisis invol ving Austria has demonst rat ed, the Union has the right to prot ect itself
N ever thel ess, the legal m ech an is ms that exist in the Treaty are weak , difficult to apply politic ally and leg ally, do not def ine the po w ers of the institutions and do not guarantee fa ir legal treat ment for process es of major importance . S us p ending a state is just such a proces s, and is to be con d em n ed
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urg ency in the IGC agenda , and in itself this jus tif ies a th or ough re vision of the Trea ties
We feel that at present the central issues about con ven ing an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Trea ties are far more important than the cont ro vers y taking place here about the si z e of the agenda . They are also more important than the cont ro vers y over the appropri at en ess or other wise of form ul ating proposals for new issues to be cover ed, and more important than the cont ro vers y over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it
We feel that these issues result from the IGC ' s appropri at en ess and its objectives , as well as from the matters which will in e v it ably be discuss ed there
We have doub ts concerning the appropri at en ess of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being address ed may be far rem o ved from the changes required to allow for the enlargement env is aged
This rel ates in particular to the intend ed agenda , particularly as regards the Amsterdam left over s, which suggest s that unacceptable inn er c ab in et s will be creat ed in the future. This also i d enti f ies areas relating to the second and third p ill ar s, which t end to be ref lect ed in an u nd es i ra ble m il it ar isation of the European Union
These are some of the basic reason s why we do not agree with the aim s of the motion for a resolution now before us
- The European Parliament ary L ab our Party has ab st ain ed on the final vote on the Le in en D im it ra k op ou l os Report
The text is over am b iti ou s, and B rit ain ' s L ab our M E P s believe that the IGC should pri m arily deal with the " A m sterdam left - over s " in order to prep are for enlargement , and not exp and far be y ond these
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow con so lid ation and strengthen ing of the EU institutions
E x p an sion of the agenda and d r as tic re vision of the t rea ties would bring with it a risk of de - st ab il isation
The key fact or in this text as it has been amend ed, is the call for a Ch arter of Fund amental Right s to be incorpor ated into the t rea ties
In our view, this would bring with it a comple x legislative b ur den , and it would be pre fer able to have a political and dec l ar atory ch arter which explain s to citizens what their existing rights are
Our prior ities ( i .e. the " le ft - over s " ) must be :
the number and respon sib ili ties of Commission ers
we igh ting of v ot es in the Council
ext ension of Q M V in areas where it will benefit the U K and Europe ( b ut not Treaty change , def ence matter s, border control s or tax ation ) , and ext ension of cod ec ision where ver Q M V is extend ed
B ey ond this, we have concerns that the " f le x ibility " or en h an ced cooperation sugg es tion is not appropriate at present
The provision s of Amsterdam are large ly un t est ed and allow ing more scope for op t - out s could weak en the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applic ant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation
- ( S V ) In order to be able to inf lu ence development s, the European Parliament must adopt a more con stru ctive at tit ud e towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than em erg es from the present resolution , which disp lay s far too much dis app oint ment and ne g a tiv ity about the decision which the European Council made in H els ink i in De ce mber 1999
The European Parliament and its Committee on Con s titutional Affairs o u ght inst ead to have been more specific and concentr ated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in H els ink i , so st ating what it considered to be the most press ing matters for discussion , including the question of establishing a public pro secutor to deal with cri m es against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests
We S w ed ish Ch ris ti an Dem ocrat s also opp ose any threat s which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the e ast if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extend ed very consider ably to include subject s in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997
The most important task of the forth coming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the ac ces sion of the new Member States
I therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now gi ving the form al go - a he ad to the Intergovernmental Conference
I non eth el ess consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resol ved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place
I also refer to my expl an ation of vote of 1 8 No ve mber 1999 which cl ar if ies my at tit ud e towards sup r an ational ism and common def ence
J oint resolution on Austria
Madam President, the Union for a Europe of N ations Group did not as soci ate itself with the joint P P E / D E - P S E resolution on the political situation in Austria following the form ation in that country of a co al ition government between the cons erv atives and J ö r g Haider ' s F reedom Party
This P P E / D E - P S E resolution comm end s the initiative taken by f ourt een Member States to apply press ure to Austria by organ ising a s ort of di p l om atic bo y c ot t
What we find most sh ock ing is the fact that this joint inter vention cla im s the authority of the Treat y, as if this st ated some wh ere that h ence fort h the free and democratic exp ression of a people could be can cell ed by the will of the he ad s of government of ne igh bour ing countries who in fact, in this inst ance, have careful ly ref ra ined from cons ul ting their own pe op les
Wh ate ver J ö r g Haider ' s ver bal ex cess es, which we of course dep l ore , the Austri ans have made a democratic ch o ice , and we must respect this
In our opinion, it is clear that the left w ing in the European Parliament, in as soci ation with the Austrian left w ing which was def e ated in the elect or al ar en a, have m ount ed a p et ty political c amp a ign res or ting to the m em ory of a s in ister but for t un ately by g one period
Al though comp ar ing Haider to H it ler is a con cept without any cre di bility what so ever, it has non eth el ess part ly achie ved its purp ose in un se t t ling some P P E / D E Members of Parliament
But , going be y ond this p et ty political oper ation, what the majority in the European Parliament is a f ra id of most of all is that the threat to the left - ri ght co h ab it ation in Austri a, which caus ed political life to st ag n ate and r ot , may soon sp read to the European system of co - man age ment which is produ cing equ ally app all ing results
In order to prevent this threat to the system , it is read y to do any th ing, including over r ul ing the out come of free ele ction s, including set ting up a thought polic e, including establishing a new form of total it ar ian ism
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Fr on t national , the V la am s B lo k and the M ov i ment o social e it al ian o, I should like to ask the question : in this out ra ge ous inter ference in internal Austrian affair s which the European Union has undert ak en in contra vention of general international law , in contra vention of the Trea ti es, in contra vention of mor ality , who is p ull ing the str ings ?
Is this h y st eri a s pon t an e ous ?
Is it the product of mere fo ol ish ness or , more prob ab ly, of a deli ber ate strateg y, which is the same throughout the world ?
Wh o is imp os ing their will on the n ations of Europe, d ar ing to st op them ch o os ing their own f ate ?
U nder g round net wor ks ?
The government of the United States, or of Israel ?
O r their Social ist back - up t ro op s who , in this House , have the ch ee k to th r ust their values down our th ro at s ?
What , then , are the values of these Social ists who fe ather ed their elect or al n est in the last cent ur y by p ain ting the idea of greater social justice in g low ing col our s for the benefit of the under pri v ile g ed, and who today are nothing more than the party of prot ect ed civil serv ant s, full - ti me un ion official s and state capital ism ?
What are the values of the B el g ian Social ist Par t y, which only goes from pa ed oph ili a sc and als to cor ru p tion sc and al s, v ia V and am and Ag ust a ?
What are the values of the French Social ist Par t y, which ext ort ed money from all the to wn c ouncil s under its th um b in the U r b a, S ag es and G rac o sc and als ?
The party l ed by Fr an ç o is M it ter rand , dec or ated with the em ble m of Mar s h al P é tain ' s V ich y government , the party whose lead ing light s have just been c au ght red - h and ed once again , living a life of l u x ur y on the public funds em b e z z led from the stud ents ' m ut ual ins ur ance compan y
I shall not even mention the in stan ces of cor ru p tion in the It al ian Social ist Par t y, because it does not do to k ick a man when he is down , still less when he is de ad and g one
I shall , however, mention the S p anish Social ist Party which has just form ed an all i ance with the but ch ers of Al b ace te and which set t led its account s with B as q ue national ists by h ir ing contra ct k ill ers
I shall also mention the German Social ist Party which d a res to pre ach to us about the second world w ar , when it is international social ist in the way that its pe ers were N ational Social ist s, still go ose - st e pp ing, the party of the W a ff en S S
( T he President c ut the speak er off )
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution . Finally, I ab st ain ed on the vote for a number of reason s
I was in sy mp ath y with the E D D Group amendment , talking about re jec ting the inter ference of the EU in the form ation of governments of Members States but I had to ab st ain because it just follow ed on the con d em n ation of xenophob i a, r ac ism, e t c . and I f el t that it might be mis in ter p re ted
However, I do w on der about the w is d om of this
Firstly, there is the question of tr ying to combat int ol er ance with int ol er ance and the long -term consequ ences of that
I also w on der about the w is d om of the EU and its re action to the form ation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is get ting more support rather than less from the opp o sition by outside governments
E ven Am er ic a has now said that it is consider ing b re aking off di p l om atic relations
We w on der if this is actually fe ed ing the fla m es of xenophob ia and the par ties and people that support it
I really think that people should be extremely c au ti ous
If you want to combat xenophob ia and r ac ism, and I believe that we should , we need to look at the ro ot caus es
We need to look at the people who vote for these parti es, and understand why this situation ar ises
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want , but we need to be careful about the approach we take , so that we do not in the end up with the opp os ite of what we are tr ying to achieve
Madam President, I strong ly ref ute any statement , demonst ration or feel ing of xenophob ia or r ac ism
I p as sion ately def end Europe ' s her it age of human rights and the r ule of law
I dis ag ree , however, for this very reason , with the sen sel ess actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortun ately - which have result ed in a real institution al b lu nder on behalf of the other f ourt een States
This is not the way to fight extre m ism
It may even be a way of doing extre m ism a great deal of good
The to r r ent of conf u sion and r as h actions that has been un le as h ed over Austria has b l own things out of all prop or tion . It has caus ed consider able dist ress to dec ent citizens and e v ok es ris ks that had previous ly not even been considered
There is an ir re con ci la ble contra dic tion between posi tions adopted in the na me of human rights and the r ule of law , but which at the same time att ack the fundamental rights of the Austri ans and r ide r ough s h od over the basic t en et s of the r ule of law , in this case the standards la id down in the Trea ties
What are we actually seek ing to achieve in em b ark ing on an Intergovernmental Conference ?
A Europe of 2 7 States or a Europe of 1 4 , or even fe wer ?
We support Europe, a Europe which does hon our to all the actions that have brought us to this point , a Europe which respect s the Trea ties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria
This needs to be said !
Madam President, I am de light ed and p rou d that this Parliament has , by an en orm ous majority , con d em n ed the form ation of the co al ition in Austria incorpor ating Mr Haider ' s F reedom Party
Mr Haider has demonst rat ed, over the past years by both words and de ed s, that he des er ves to be exc lud ed from n orm al democratic disc our se
N ot only has he ad m ire d A d ol f H it l er, p ra ised the W a ff en S S , and ref us ed to con d em n a terr or ist b om b ing that k ill ed four R om a, but also in C ar in th ia has been a member of the regional government
He has l ed efforts to end provision for Austria ' s S lo ven e -s pe aking min ority and assistance to immig r ants
S ome have said it is not right for us to inter f ere in Austrian politic s
They are wr ong
European Union Trea ties make it inc um b ent on us to prot ect fundamental rights
S ome have said we have to accept the results of democratic ele ctions
However, democratic ele ctions do not make dem ocrat s of those who have threat en ed democracy
There is the tra g ic mon u ment of the H ol oc a ust , the de ath of 6 million J e w s, to those who argu ed the same case with respect to German y in the 1 9 3 0 s
However, we should not con d em n Mr Haider for amb ition
Le op ard s do not change their sp ot s
The real c ul p rit s are Austria ' s Ch ris ti an Dem ocrat ac ting as J ud as go at s to res ur rect a threat to Europe that we thought had di ed B er lin in 1 9 4 5
Madam President, we have just pass ed a resolution which con d em n s the r ac ist and xenophob ic rec ord of J ö r g Haider ' s F reedom Party in Austri a, which has wel com ed action by our governments to c ut off political relations with any government of which he is part , and which s end s our support to anti - rac ist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people
We w arn that this co al ition , if it is form ed today, unaccept ably leg iti m ises the extre me right , direct ly in contra dic tion with the principles of peace and recon cili ation, which bring us together in this European Union
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to j o in us
This European Parliament requ i res the European Commission to be v ig il ant of any r ac ist action in Austri a, and threat ens to su sp end Austria from members hip of the European Union if this happ ens
I am p rou d to support such a resolution
Th ough our proposal to with d ra w political inv it ations to any Austrian government represent ative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give no tice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the po w ers of this European Parliament to combat the ret urn of ne o - N a z is to government in Europe can and will be taken
I shall take the f lo or very brief ly, Madam President
I respect Parliament' s wish , as it has been express ed, but I must also say that the s el f- d et er mination of pe op les cannot be call ed into question , even by the European Parliament
The document is un f air both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and to members of the Austrian national parliament , and it sm ack s s light ly of j e al ous y and political interest s, but also of business
I do not believe that these sign als will change the citizens ' indi ffer ence to Europe
The Austrian extre me right has been gi f ted an un w ar r ant ed present
I very much welcome the position taken by the It al ian R ad ical s ; and I say this while making a clear hist or ic and materi al dis tin ction between It al ian li ber als and Austrian li ber als
I have for many years, in word and de ed, been comm itted to the anti -f as c ist st ru gg le and the st ru gg les for equal rights and against xenophob ia
However, recent event s - first ly, what were really threat s by the Council of Minister s, then Mr Prodi ' s threat s against the Austrian Commissioner and, fin ally, the present decision - are things I cannot support
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its pre m ises
What we have here , first and fore most , is an incre di b ly o min ous m i xt ure of power , ar ro g ance and imp ot ence on the part of the European Union
N ot only do these decisions conf lic t with the Treaty and app or tion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are en tit led but, wor st of all, their effect will be c oun ter - p rodu ctive
They will not weak en Mr Haider and the F P Ö . On the cont r ary , they will strengthen them
We shall ob tain the very opp os ite of what we want
That is not how you combat r ac ism and a s w ing to the right

 ( D A ) The Le ft ' s Members of the European Parliament att ach importance to the fact that, with today ' s decision , Parliament has N O T support ed the f ourt een pri me min ister s ' di p l om atic s an ctions against Austria
The Le ft ' s Members of Parliament therefore support ed the Li beral decision ' s power ful re jec tion of any form of xenophob ia in Austria or else wh ere
We att ach crucial importance to apply ing, if necessary , the new provision s under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its action s, inf ring es fundamental citizens ' rights by means of discri mination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU ' s Council of Minister s rem o ved
- ( E L ) The F reedom Party ' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union' s political future
It is a ' T ro j an h or se ' which is unfortun ately re ap pe ar ing in Europe l ar g er than ever since the Second W or ld W ar
The European Parliament and the Union' s governments must politic ally is ol ate a government that includ es ad m ir ers of N a z ism and adv oc ates of xenophob ia
The European Union bear s a large measure of responsibility - and al ong with it the two d om in ant political movement s, the Social Dem ocrat s and the Ch ris ti an Dem ocrat s - because , by their do g m atic ad her ence to the h ar s h financial policies of E M U , their dis l oc ation of the wel f are state and their de ific ation of un con t ro ll ed competition , they have p us h ed broad str at a of soci ety to the limit s and made it possible for right - w ing extre m ists of the Haider type to rec ru it support for their ne o - N a z i way s
In view of the fact that the R ul es of Pro ced ure of the European Parliament do not per mit us to t able our own resolution con d em ning Haider ' s part y, as well as all the par ties throughout Europe which dis se min ate r ac ist s la nder and which are xenophob ic and h os ti le to immig r ant work ers, we voted in favour of the comprom ise resolution
We did so even though we did not agree with some of its rec ital s or term s, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opp os ing the Austrian extre me right and its dem ag og u er y
Our vote in no way constit utes an end or se ment of the sign ator ies to this comprom ise resolution , their present policy or their future at tit ud e should the threat of the extre me right become more serious
S ome of these parti es, despite dec l ar ing themselves to be rep ublic an and democratic , adopt the dem ag og u er y of the extre me right , either out of conn iv ance or as a vote - w in ning p loy , if only in open ly and h y p oc ri tic ally b la m ing the immig r ant work ers in our countries for unemployment , and gener ally making their li ves more difficult
M ore gener ally, those sign ator ies who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the inf lu ence which the extre me right has man aged to g ain since their policy, dev oted exc lu sive ly to the interests of b ig bus ines s, has not included taking action like ly to e ra dic ate unemployment and the po ver ty it en g end ers, and has th us fa cil it ated the xenophob ic dem ag og u er y of the extre me right
This week we he ard the first political c ry of the new -b or n Europe
B y sta un ch ly and spe edi ly d en oun cing the participation of J ö r g Haider ' s xenophob ic and anti - E uro pe an party in the Austrian government , a situation without pre ced ent since the second world w ar , the European Union has come into its political b ir th ri ght and has confirm ed that it is not mere ly an economic and financial Community , a large market , a " E uro pe of sh op k eep ers "
It is a part of its future which is at st ake right now , part of its very ess ence, its hear t and s ou l
The European Parliament was the first to speak up
The appe al by the European Social ist s, on the initiative of O li v i er D u h a me l , raised aw ar en ess and en abled there to be a firm and immedi ate political response to this un he ard of and int ol er able situ ation. A firm at tit ud e which the 1 4 European States have demonstr ated un an im ous ly and pro mp t ly, through Mr G ut er re s, by con d em ning the risk of the Austrian political situation get ting out of control
This c oura ge ous st ance turn s a new p age in the con struction of Europe
A ret urn to the ro ot s, at last , for a Community bu il t on the basis of the deter mination to turn our back s on a past hist ory mar red by h at red and exc lusion and of ad her ence to the human ist values of open ness and to ler ance
Europe has man aged to stand up to con d em n unacceptable event s
However, as it lack s the legal instru ments to support this political will , since the s an ctions sti pul ated under Article 7 of the Trea ties are v ir t ually imp os sible to app ly, will it be able to keep its he ad high in the face of the threat of the system atic b l ock ing of its entire institution al structure ?
The whole cre di bility of Europe is at st ake today, before we inv ite the recent and still v ul ner able democra ci es of the form er e ast ern b l oc to j o in us tomorrow
F rom now on Europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its red is c over ed amb ition
At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inc lusion of ne o - N a z is in the government of a European Union Member State , I must express my reg re ts regarding a comprom ise text which is particularly lack ing in back b one
I am voting in favour of it because it is inc on ce iv able that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday , should not adopt a st ance on this matter
P ers on ally, however, I shall continue to fight against the extre me right , to urge people to sign a pe ti tion to demand measures which may go as far as the exc lusion of Austri a, and to organ ise a major public demonst ration in L il le on S at ur day at 3 p . m
F as c ism and ne o - N a z ism are can c ers !
The f ou l mon ster has been re a w ak en ed !
For me there is no question of allow ing them to develop and to f l our ish without f igh ting with all our might
Europe was b or n out of a des ire for peace , freedom and to ler ance
There is no question of it allow ing xenophob ic , r ac ist and anti - S em i tic min ister s to be to ler ated at within it
Do not count on me to keep qu i et , without doing or saying any thing
In yesterday ' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed wor ry that we were inter fer ing in the internal affair s of a Member State
S uch a concern is mis p la ced
The European Parliament has never been s low to comment on develop ments in Member States with which they dis ag ree
We have con d em n ed B as q ue and I r ish terr or ism
We have opp osed r ac ism and the inf ring e ment of the rights of min or ities
It is our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratic ally elect ed v o ice of the European Union, to comment on current political develop ments in Austria which are in conf lic t with the policies of this parliament
B y comm en ting and making our views know n we are not pre ven ting any party in Austria from form ing a co al ition government
We are non eth el ess, as is our right as well as our responsibility , tell ing them that if they go a he ad then there are consequ ences ar ising from such a decision and in fact we are w ar ning them before h and
O thers would ar g ue that we should su sp end jud ge ment until we see the detail of such an agreement
S uch a view is not only a political c op - out , it is positive ly dangerous
In reach ing an agreement with J ö r g Haider and his part y, the Austrian Ch ris ti an Dem ocrat s would at a st ro ke be confirm ing political respect ability on right w ing extre m ism and also gi ving them access to power - both of which they will u til ise as a la un ch ing p ad for even greater elect or al success
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria
- ( S V ) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exp osed to xenophob ia and r ac ism . We have also voted in favour of the resolution in prot est against the det est able politic s that J ö r g Haider stand s for
We are non eth el ess very cri tical of the m eth od s which the 1 4 Member States have employ ed on this issue
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States ' national i d enti ties and cons titutional tra ditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty
What is also mis s ing is a paragraph concerning the EU ' s sh ared responsibility for the social and political develop ments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider ' s elect or al success
T od ay , as previous ly in the hist ory of Europe, right - w ing extre m ism is the result of in sec ure social and economic conditions of life
The policy of c ut -b ack s which has follow ed in the w ake of ad j us ting to E M U has prom oted the success es of right - w ing extre m ism
A r ad ical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe
- ( D E ) I am making this statement on behalf of the C S U
It is int ol er able that the EU should involve itself in the form ation of the government in a Member State
It has no right to do so
In st ead of pre m at ure ly con d em ning the F P Ö and the Austrian Government which is being form ed, there should first be a cri tical exam in ation and assess ment of the government al dec l ar ation and the party programme and policies of the co al ition
On ly after such cri tical app ra is al of the future policies of the par ties involved in the co al ition discussion s can a decision be made as to whether this government is cont r ary to the democratic spirit of Europe
This does not mean that we sy mp ath ise with Haider
The C S U European de leg ates have no sy mp ath y what so ever with the lead er of the F P Ö
However, as poli ti ci ans we must ask the question why 2 7 % of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the F P Ö at the ele ctions in O ct o ber 1999
We must concern ourselves with the reason s for this and tr y to deal with the reason s behind such results
On ly by t ack ling the argu ments and policies of the F P Ö can we prevent a r ad ical isation of Austrian politic s
However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reason s for the out come of the Austrian vote and off ers no op tions for resol ving the problem
For these reason s the C S U European de leg ates are against this resolution
" H e k ne w what those j ub il ant c row d s did not know but could have le arn ed from bo ok s : that the pla g ue b a ci ll us never di es or dis ap pe ar s for good ; that it can li e d orm ant for years and years in f urn it ure and l in en - ch est s ; that it b id es its time in b ed ro om s, c e ll ar s, tr un k s, and bo ok s h el ves ; and that perhaps the day would come when , for the ban e and the en light ening of m en, it would r ouse up its r at s again and s end them forth to di e in a happ y c ity . "
It is with these ph r as es that Al ber t C am u s, at the close of the long al leg or ical no vel des c rib ing the difficult fight of the citizens of the to wn of O r an against the pla g ue , remind s us, at the close of the Second W or ld W ar , that the fight against N a z ism, " th e bro wn pla g ue " as it was term ed at the time, could not en j o y a defin i tive v ict ory
That because ra cial h at red , xenophob ic vi ol ence, fear and re jec tion of what is different , have de ep ro ot s in all that is bas est in human ity , they may re - em er ge at any moment and take over any group of human being s
In this light , the event s we are see ing in Austria must be seen as tra g ic
For the first time since the Second W or ld W ar , a party which is open ly pro - N a z i , r ac ist and xenophob ic has g ain ed access to power in a European country
Con f ron ted with this threat , which car ri es with it the ne g ation of the very idea which li es at the hear t of the con struction of Europe, nothing must deter us : not the legal qu ib b ling about what the treat y does or does not per mit , not the leg iti m ate questions about the right to inter ven e, not the d er is ory respect for form al democracy , and, above all, not the feel ing of power less ness which g ri p s us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our conv ic tions but which we are power less to control
As the represent ative for a French over se as dep art ment , the is land of R é un ion , a l and of ra cial and e th n ic inter m i x ing, where the population has been for ged in the course of the last three cent ur ies by the suc ces sive contribution s of European s, b la c ks from A f ric a or Mad ag as c ar , enl ist ed m en from Ind ia or P ak ist an , or even Ch ines e, every day I experience the prof ound tr uth of the rem ark by S ain t - E x up é ry , " I n being different to me , you are not doing me harm , bro ther , but en r ich ing me ! "
This human di vers ity is our main sour ces of we alth , and this is the reason why it is my d ut y to tra ck down and to con d em n any thing which may be harm ful to it, where ver it may exist
For all these reason s I voted most decid ed ly in favour of the resolution before this House on the form ation of the government in Austria
J ö r g Haider ' s r ise to power , with the in au g ur ation of a cons erv ative right - w ing and F P Ö co al ition government , is a sign of the ter ri ble rev i val in Europe of a mon ster to which li beral ism has given b ir th
The success of the Austrian F reedom Party o w es as much to the end or se ment of respect ability provided by the Austrian right w ing and social dem ocrat s as to the policy of the l at ter , whose social disast ers pa ved the way for extre me right - w ing popul ism
The resolution sti pul ates possible di p l om atic means to is ol ate the new government politic ally without even mention ing the ro ot caus es of the res ur g ence of F as c ism . It can be explain ed by the feel ing of help less ness of the people who are the vic ti ms of the ide olog y of might y M am m on and by the ch o ice of the rul ing cl ass es to promote strong government in order to take their policies of a ust er ity and d ere g ul ation ever further
In order to opp ose the xenophob ic state ments of an app r enti ce d ict ator who is no st al g ic for the Th ird R e ich , we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austri ans opp osed to F as c ism
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in sp ite of its h y p oc ri tical refer ences to a ' E uro pe an democratic mod el ' which bear s more res em b l ance to a for t ress which tra c ks down s, ex pe l s and imp ris ons immig r ants without the proper p aper s, when it is not open ing f il es on t een ag ers
- ( D E ) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being form ed between the Ö V P and the F P Ö
I consider the cas ting of J ö r g Haider as " E uro pe 's sc a pe go at " ( or even wor se , ne o - N a z i and S u per R ac ist ) to be c oun ter p rodu ctive
Of course I , in no way , agree with the public ised state ments of this right - w ing popul ist and fully con d em n xenophob ia and any down p lay ing of the H it ler reg ime
However, I fear that a p ure ly em o tion al re action by Europe to the event s in Austria will only mul ti p ly Haider 's ad her ents
The EU must not do him an inv al u able P R service
The strength of the F P Ö can be tra ced back to the weak ness of the previous government and in this the Austrian social ists must bear the main responsibility
It was only after they un s uc cess ful ly s olic ited the F P Ö to to ler ate a min ority government and, obvious ly in v ain , offer ed the F reedom Party min ister ial post s, that the S P Ö begin its m as sive c amp a ign against Haider
It turn ed its threat en ed l os s of power into an " her o ic b at t le for the pres erv ation of values " and an im min ent, p ure - and -si mp le " d ec ision between democracy and non- d em ocra cy "
This is a s me ar on the v ot ers in my ne igh bour ing country which I cannot con d one
We German Ch ris ti an Dem ocrat s used another strategy in the b at t le against extre m ists and clearly dis as soci ated ourselves from them
We re ve al ed the ho llow ness of the rep ublic ans who were national istic , xenophob ic and anti - min ority
T od ay the rep ublic ans are no longer represent ed in most local parliament s
The German approach is no guarantee that this r ad ical movement will not grow again
It cannot be c op ied ar b it r arily since each Member State has its own specific conditions
The Ö V P (A ustri an Pe ople 's Party ) , whose pres ence at European level we have also come to take for grant ed, is d ar ing to attemp t a co al ition for the s ake of govern ability in Austria
It can only suc ceed if agreements are made which are solid ly based on comp li ance with democratic principles
The Council has become pre m at ure ly involved without w a iting for the results of the co al ition negotiations or a programme of government
This con d em n ation is as unacceptable as the threat en ed b re aking off of official cont act s with the Austrian Rep ublic
S ound democracy means being al er t and not b l ind in one e y e
We must take up a reason ed off ensive against r ad ical s on both the right and the left
I would have li k ed to see the same out ra ge in Europe when the social ists were prepared to make common cause with the success ors to the mis an th ro p ic and per secut ory reg ime in the D D R
In the mean ti me , they have been form ing governments in German f eder al states
I fully support the state ments made by Commissioner Prodi in today 's s ession
He sp o ke of the task of not is ol ating Member States but of doing every thing to un ite them in common European values
- ( F R ) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria
Austria is a free , independent and so ver e ign country
Con sequ ent ly, ne ither the Council, the Commission n or the European Parliament has the right to inter f ere in the internal administration of a Member State
The Austrian ele ctions were held in a free , proper and democratic man ner
An y inter ference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable ; it is in vi ol ation of the European Treaty (A r tic le 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam )
N ever thel ess, these same institutions show ed no re lu ct ance to accept Turke y as a c and id ate for members hip of the European Union, despite its well - know n human rights vi ol ations
N ot hing of this nature has yet occ ur red in Austria
On the one hand, the political exc omm un ic ation of Austria only demonstr ates the wor ry ing inf lu ence of conf orm ist thought . On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first rece ive not the confidence of the n ation but the end or se ment of sup r an ational bod ies, then the very principle of democracy will be d est ro y ed
In such circ um stan ces will it even be worth having ele ctions ?
This is not the way to create the conditions for the n ations of Europe to live together in harmon y and to be able to cooper ate to achieve a sh ared future
- ( F R ) The vote which has just taken place in this Ch am ber is a hist or ic one for it is the first time we have ever deb ated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such an x i ety
I believe there are circ um stan ces when the question of principles and institution al regulations is ob l iter ated
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to prot ect the fundamental values of the Union
I urge the Commission to be less c au ti ous
In this resolution , Parliament is ass um ing its respon sib ili ties
Ha ving said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute min imum , the very least we could do
P ers on ally I argu ed in favour of a rather hard er line , and I support ed Amend ments N os 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as well as the or al amendment tabled by the Social ist Group
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only p ure ly technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includ es members of the Austrian F reedom Party
In c lud ing J ö r g Haider ' s party in a co al ition government makes the pres ence of the extre me right an every day fact of life in Europe, and set s an extremely dangerous pre ced ent which may gener ate a serious after m ath in other Union Member States or in c and id ate countries
The Austrian Pe ople ' s Party must accept some hist or ical responsibility for this
It is our fundamental values which are at st ake here
As the democratic ally elect ed representatives of the European people , we have no ch o ice
We must reject what is unacceptable , as our constit u ents demand
B ec ause , when the spe ct re of b ar b ar ism res ur f ac es, fail ure to opp ose is t ant am ount to cap it ul ation
I ab st ain ed in the vote on adop ting the resolution
I con d em n J ö r g Haider ' s r ac ist and xenophob ic policy
However, I cannot accept that an EU bod y should inter ven e politic ally in the internal policy of one Member State
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution , and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution , even though it would be a vote against the extre me right
- ( S V ) Ob vious ly, the political lead ers of Europe have a right and a d ut y to re act against Mr Haider and his party
The political lead ers of Europe are en tit led to express their view of political develop ments in another Member State , just as a pri me min ister can express his opinion about r ac ist poli ti ci ans in a local authority
Fin land ' s experience , however, is that integr ation, rather than is ol ation, is the better way of comb ating anti d em ocra tic for ces
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution , which pres u pp os es that all par ties have respect for human rights
The EU Presidency ' s " c omm on re action " against the form ation of the government in Austria is leg ally un j us tif i ed. The t rea ties do not author ise this re action by the 1 4 Member States
N or should we is ol ate the for ces in Austria which wish to work for human rights
D es pite these objec tions of m ine to the Council ' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ is ol ating t ac tic s, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stand s on questions of r ac ism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote
That conclud es the vote
A d j our n ment of the s ession
I dec la re the s ession of the European Parliament ad j our n ed
( T he sitting was cl osed at 12 . 2 5 p . m. )
R es u mp tion of the s ession
I dec la re res um ed the s ession of the European Parliament ad j our n ed on Th urs day 3 F e b ru ary 2000
A pp ro val of the Min utes of the previous sitting
The Min utes of the sitting on Th urs day 3 F e b ru ary have been dist rib ut ed
A re there any comments ?
I can see from your re action that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Min utes and clearly you cannot appro ve Min utes which you have not seen
I therefore propose to sub mit the Min utes for your appro val tomorrow mor ning , since obvious ly you do not have them and I must ap olog ise for this
I shall therefore post p one the appro val of the Min utes
Madam President, on a point of order
The B B C this mor ning report ed that a B ri tis h Member of this House , hold ing a sen i or position within his de leg ation, contin ues to offer strategic adv ice to priv ate c li ent s, but does not state in the Reg ister of Inter est s who these c li ents are
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest s ep ar ate from priv ate pro fit , but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both public ly available and e a si ly ac ces sible
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Q u a est or s, may I ask you to use your inf lu ence both to ensure that the Reg ister of Inter est s is brought up to d ate and mod if ied to cover in stan ces of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Reg ister is not only available for ins pe ction by this House , but is also p ub lish ed on the Intern et ?
Thank you, Mr D av ies
I shall look into this matter with the C ol le ge of Q u a est ors
Madam President, on a point of order
As this is the first V al en tin e ' s D ay of the new m ill en n ium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be f it ting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to t ack ling hear t dis e ase , the b ig g est k ill er in the European Union
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the W in ning H ear ts Conference that every ch ild b or n in the new m ill en n ium has the right to live until the a ge of at least 6 5 without su ffer ing from avoid able card i ov as c ular dis e ase
Ha pp y V al en tin e ' s D ay !
Madam President, I r ise under R ule 9 of the R ul es of Pro ced ure of this House and all ud e to the same point raised by Mr D av ies about the very serious al leg ations made on B B C r ad i o this mor ning
I would welcome an ass ur ance from you that you will order an inves tig ation to ensure that the two Members who were n am ed in this particular B B C inter v iew are not run ning their companies from this Parliament or from parliament ary offic es, because that would be a very serious matter indeed
In the past the B ri tis h Con s erv atives ' dou ble standards have brought the United K ing d om ' s House of Comm ons into dis re p ute , and there is a very real dang er that such beh av i our would have a sim ilar imp act on this Parliament
Thank you, Mr M ur ph y
As I inform ed Mr D av ies, I prom ise to look into this matter this very even ing with the qu a est ors
Madam President, on a point of order
I have already wr itt en to you on a number of occasion s concerning how points of order are raised in the House
I w on der on what point of order Mr D av ies was spe aking
Wh y did he not mention the fact that one of his own Li beral colleagues also has a consult an cy that is under inves tig ation by the B B C ?
Is this House going to let its agenda be deter min ed by sc ur ri l ous report s on a programme which bas es its new s item s on li es, or is it going to get down to serious work and address the chall eng es fa cing Europe ?
G entlemen , obvious ly the qu a est ors who look into this matter are not going to be bas ing their assess ment just on information from r ad i o programmes
They will look into the matter th or ough ly
Madam President, I believe I am express ing the feel ing of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the m ess age which the President of the Commission s ent to the new Austrian Ch ance ll or a week ag o creat ed some une ase
W as it in fact necessary in this m ess age to specifically offer his best wishes for suc ces s, or to say, " I am sure that you will demonstr ate the same commitment as sh own by your pre d ecess ors to li ber t y, democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedom s " , or indeed that he aw a ited produ ctive and con stru ctive cooperation ?
This is wh y, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi cl ar if y tomorrow exact ly what signific ance he me ant to give these words, so that no b od y, absolutely no b od y, can use this m ess age , which is un us ual and un wise , to say the least , to contrib ute , and that includ es c oun ter to the int en tions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political oper ation taking place in Austria a common p la ce
Thank you, Mr W ur t z
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point . This was just a proced ural motion
Let me remind you, Mr W ur t z , that we shall be see ing Mr Prodi tomorrow . He is going to make a statement on the Commission' s programme
N at ur ally you will be perf ect ly free to ask him questions in the speech es you make following this statement , just as Mr Prodi will be perf ect ly free to answer you
I suggest that you cl ar if y this matter at that time, if you so wish and if Mr Prodi ag re es
Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to t rou ble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here tw ice before
I have already to ld you on a number of occasion s that we , on behalf of the D ut ch con ting ency , would like a D ut ch te le vision ch ann el
There are now 2 8 ch ann els here in this Parliament, including two G ree k , one Portuguese , one Fin n ish and one B el g ian , but still no D ut ch , and as many as se ven En g lish , six German and six French
I was prom ised back in S ep t ember that there would be a D ut ch ch ann el by J an u ary
It is now F e b ru ary and we are still w a iting
I would ask you once again to work on this
I w on der what kind of medi a e val bureauc ra cy is at work here pre ven ting a D ut ch ch ann el from being trans mitted by s ate ll ite
Mrs P lo o i j - V an G or sel , let me say how dis app oint ed I am , because I person ally thought this problem had been resol ved long ag o
I have clearly received your seri es of m ess ag es on this subject and I believe that Mrs B an ot ti has an answer for you
I shall therefore, with your per m ission , give the f lo or to Mrs B an ot ti to rep ly to you under the proced ural motion
Madam President, as my de ar f ri end E l ly will know , I will do any thing to make her and my D ut ch colleagues happ y
I would like to ass ure you as qu a est or in ch arge of this issue that we have had technical discussion s about the various ch ann els on te le vision and r ad i o, and I have already st ar ted m ail ing colleagues in this connection
If it is of any com fort to h er, the I r ish have not g ot their ch ann el yet either
There seem to be int ra ct able technical problems but we are defin ite ly working on it
Thank you for gi ving me the opportunity to cl ar if y this
I am not so sure that our D ut ch Members will be reas s ure d on the ground s that the I r ish Members too are un able to rece ive a national ch ann el
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can rece ive their own national ch ann el
Thank you, Mrs B an ot ti , and also the other qu a est ors for your effort to achieve this
Madam President, I should like to tell Mr W ur t z that the Commission' s do ct r ine is not the B re z h ne v do ct r ine of limited so ver e ign ty and that, until pro ved other wise , we are not in the situation where Artic les 6 and 7 would be applic able
Austri a, therefore, is perf ect ly en tit led to form its government and the President of the Commission is perf ect ly en tit l ed, and even d ut y b ound , to offer Austria his best wishes
Mr W ur t z should perhaps re me mber that not so long ag o other members of his part y, the French Comm un ist may or s, were s ending b ull d o z ers against immig r ant ho st els in France
Ag enda
The next item is the final ver sion of the draft agenda as dra wn up by the Conference of President s, purs u ant to R ule 1 1 0 of the R ul es of Pro ced ure
a ) S it ting s from 1 4 to 1 8 F e b ru ary 2000 in St r as bour g R e lating to W ed n es day :
President
In view of the fact that no Council represent ative is able to att end on W ed n es day even ing, a number of groups - the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Par t y, the Group of the Party of European Social ist s, the Group of the European Li beral , Dem ocrat and R ef orm Par t y, the Group of the G re ens / E uro pe an F ree All i ance, the Con f eder al Group of the European United Le ft / N ord ic G re en Le ft - reques ted that the Council statement on the C y pr us question and Mr B ro k ' s report on the pre - ac ces sion strategy for C y pr us and M al t a were deal t with during the joint debate and that these two item s pl us Mr S w ob od a ' s report were brought forward in the agenda
This would then give us, for W ed n es day ' s sitting , the two Council state ments on the co her ence of Union policies with development policy and on the U N ' H uman Right s ' sitting , follow ed by the joint debate on C y pr us and then the report s by Mr S w ob od a, Mr C or ri e, Mrs Fr ass on i and Mr K n ö r r B or r à s
Is there any one who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal ?
S ince no one wishes to speak , I shall put this proposal to the vote
( P ar liament g ave its ass ent ) R e lating to Th urs day :
President
I have received several proposed amendments relating to the top ical and urg ent subject s of major importance
On the subject of human right s, I have received two proposals for ad ditions : one from the Group of the European Li beral , Dem ocrat and R ef orm Party for an item en tit led ' C am b od ia ' and the other from the Group of the G re en s, for an item en tit led ' P in o ch et '
As you know , we can only include five item s in the ' H uman Right s ' sec tion
A cc ord ing to the list given in the final ver sion of the agenda , there are already four item s
We can therefore t able only one addition al item
Wh o wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Li beral , Dem ocrat and R ef orm Party to propose the addition of an item on C am b od ia ?
Madam President, it is h uge ly important to the Li beral Group that we talk about the situation in C am b od i a, and that this is done at this particular time, not only on account of the let ter which U N Sec ret ary - G ener al , Ko f i An n an , has wr itt en to the government in C am b od i a, ask ing it to take step s, at long last , to set up a special t rib un al in order to call the lead ers of the K h m er R ou ge to account , but also because the H un S en reg ime , obvious ly not cont ent with the attemp ted ass ass in ations of the lead er of the opp o sition , Mr S am R an in s y, has now considered that his parliament ary imm unity should be li f ted to bo ot , so that he can simply be brought before the cour t
The international community has asked for jus ti fication for what is happen ing in C am b od ia
A fter all, we approved the ele ctions in C am b od i a, in what was one of the b ig g est f i as c os on the elect or al obs erv ation f ron t
On ly this Parliament has em erg ed with some of its cre d it int act
I think that we , as a Parliament, even now have to ass u me our responsibility and speak out on the situation in C am b od ia
( P ar liament g ave its ass ent ) President
The item on C am b od ia is therefore add ed to the ' H uman Right s ' sec tion . This r end ers the proposed item on P in o ch et n ull and v oid
In addition , I have received some proposals for subject s to be included in the top ical and urg ent debate
H ere we are not add ing any more sub - it em s under the ' H uman Right s ' he ad ing, we are introdu cing new item s
There are three proposals : one proposal from the Con f eder al Group of the European United Le ft / N ord ic G re en Le ft to add an item en tit l ed, ' M or ator ium on the de ath p en al ty in the United States and the case of B et ty B e et s ' ; a second proposal from the Group of the European Li beral , Dem ocrat and R ef orm Party to add an item en tit l ed, ' T he P in o ch et affair ' ; and a third from the Group of the G re ens / E uro pe an F ree All i ance for the inc lusion of a new point , ' E n v ironment al disaster in the D an ub e '
In view of the time available given that, as you know , we have a Commission statement on the rest ruct uring of business and that the current list already includ es two item s, we can only add two addition al item s
I shall take the proposal from the Con f eder al Group of the European United Le ft / N ord ic G re en Le ft first
( P ar liament reject ed the proposal )
President
We will now take the proposal from the Group of the European Li beral , Dem ocrat and R ef orm Party
Is there any one to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President, it is rem ark able that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible rele ase of Mr P in o ch et , despite the fact that international ar re st w ar r ants have already been iss u ed
S ince the B el g ian Government ' s appe al to a high er cour t was dec la red ad m is sible last week and since the decision has ess enti ally not yet been taken , it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong m ess age , a m ess age which should sign if y that no b od y can es c a pe a just t ri al
It is inc on ce iv able that the European Parliament, which quite right ly pay s so much attention to res pe c ting human right s, should fail to adopt a clear st ance on this
Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be deal t with by means of an urg ent procedure at this time
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of G ener al P in o ch et , but, further more, there are certain questions to be b or ne in mind
The first is that this matter is sub jud ice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area n or a European legal system
We are in favour of the Intern ational C ri minal Court , but it does not yet exist
Secondly, there is currently a democratic ally elect ed government in Ch ile , l ed by R ic ard o N ú ñ e z , whose first dec l ar ation was that all those who have comm itted this type of crime must face justice , and I would remind you that the Ch ile an justice system , which is independ ent, is currently exam ining 6 0 comp l ain ts l od ged against G ener al P in o ch et , concerning his cri m es against human ity
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are oblig ed to follow up , but it should not be deal t with by means of urg ent procedure
We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure
( P ar liament reject ed the proposal ) President
We now come to the third proposal which is for ' E n v ironment al disast ers in the w at ers of the D an ub e ' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the G re ens / E uro pe an F ree All i ance
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occ ur red in a t rib ut ary of the D an ub e is considered by many exper ts to be an ac cid ent on an environmental sc al e as serious as the sc al e of the C her n ob yl disaster
It affect s not only R om an i a, but also Y ug os la v ia and, in fact, the entire D an ub e bas in
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to re act s w i ft ly to this situ ation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject
( P ar liament g ave its ass ent ) President
S ti ll relating to Th urs day ' s sitting , the P P E Group has reques ted that Mrs C ed ers ch i ö ld ' s report on increasing protection by p en al s an ctions against c oun ter fe iting in connection with the introdu ction of the e uro should be brought forward to W ed n es day as the last item on the agenda
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the P P E in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President, the agenda has been re ar r ang ed so many tim es that I would simply ask the Ch am ber to support the present proposal
It is not a very time - con s um ing matter , but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delay s
It is in fact about prot ec ting the e uro against c oun ter fe iting , which is an extremely urg ent matter
We have t ried to d ri ve this proposal through . I should therefore be very gr ate ful indeed if the Ch am ber could support it
( P ar liament g ave its ass ent )
R e lating to F ri day : President
R e lating to F ri day , on F ri day mor ning we have an or al question on post al services and the Group of the Party of European Social ists is reques ting that the mo tions for resolution s should be put to the vote immedi ately after the debate and not in Brus sel s, as env is aged in the final ver sion of the draft agenda
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the P S E Group in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President, with ap olog ies to my f ri end , En ri q ue B ar ó n C res p o, I should like to speak against this proposal
I am sur pr ised it has even been made , because we ca me to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of President s
I think that your proposal , Madam President, to keep the debate and the vote s ep ar ate, with the debate on F ri day and the vote at a l ater d ate, is a reason able one . The reason is as follow s : this issue concerns no less than 1 8 00 0 00 employ ees within the European Union
We already have a directive . It is not an old one , it was iss u ed in 1997
D ec id ing upon future policy l in es, with a view to a new directive , rather has ti ly, without having had time to consult the trade un ion s or have discussion s with all the social partn ers, I feel , run s c oun ter to the spirit we wish to in ject into the debate on matters which direct ly involve the social oper at ors
I propose , therefore, that we should keep the ar r ange ments as per the agenda , with the debate on F ri day and the vote at a l ater d ate
Madam President, I clearly o w e Mr W ur t z an expl an ation, and I am going give this expl an ation before the whole House
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of President s
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner B ol k est e in was going to appe ar next week before the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism to discuss this matter
My group has deb ated this matter and con sid ers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and d ere g ul ation in such a sen si tive area , it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initi al statement , regard less of any action it may take in the future , so that Commissioner B ol k est e in may take good note and in order to guid e next week ' s debate
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr W ur t z to take a second look at what this is about
It has nothing to do with any disp utes on the sub st ance ; it is just about the following question : when will the Commission - having already had a year and a h alf to do this - fin ally be in a position to t able the directive ?
Our so le intention in t abl ing the motion is to ensure that the de ad l ines which were prom ised are now fin ally ad her ed to , and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible
That is why I should like to support the Social Dem ocrat s ' request to hold the vote on F ri day
( P ar liament g ave its ass ent )
Madam President, as you know the C ed ers ch i ö ld report has been taken off Th urs day ' s agenda
That o u ght to mean that we have more time on Th urs day
S ince we will be very press ed for time in the top ical and urg ent debate , in view of the many matters to be address ed in an h our and a h alf , I simply want ed to ask whether the s ession al services might not chec k to see whether we could have an ext ra h alf an h our for the top ical and urg ent debate so that there is su fficient spe aking time
In general the way in which sitting s have been man aged in recent wee ks seems to me to have been very ch a o tic
L ast Th urs day spe aking tim es were extremely t ight and then su d den ly we had between one and one - and - a - h alf h our s when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to w a it for the vote
On F ri day of this week we have one single item on the agenda
That is absolutely abs ur d
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sitting s are man aged
This s ound s perf ect ly fe a sible
We shall therefore see if we can extend the urg ent debate by a h alf h our , consider ing the with d ra w al of Mrs C ed ers ch i ö ld ' s report
This is all I am talking about here , just that
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for W ed n es day , which you have not yet ann oun ced
I understand that there is no argu ment about the fact that the Council dec l ar ation, on the next sitting of the United N ations Commission on H uman Right s, is not going to include the dec l ar ation on the 5 0 th ann i vers ary of the G ene v a Con vention s, and that this dec l ar ation has been proposed for the pl en ary part -s ession in Mar ch , so that it may be deli ver ed in a so le m n and form al way
I understand that there is agreement on this issue
Madam President, this after n o on , in this Ch am ber , reference was made to a seri es of report s on the B B C T od ay programme this mor ning , which cla im ed that certain of my colleagues were run ning person al l ob b ying companies or some h ow mis us ing their position as Members of this House
These are serious al leg ations
They are completely un t r ue , m al ic i ou s, politic ally b i ased and were broad c ast in the full know ledge of their f al se ho od
We are taking legal adv ice . My colleagues ' reg ister of interests is complete
If we find that any Member of this House or their employ ees co ll ab or ated with the B B C in this far ra go we will exp ose them to the opp ro b ri um of this House
Q u ite , we agree absolutely
b ) S it ting s of 1 and 2 Mar ch 2000 in Brus sels
S ustain able urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative
The next item is the joint debate on the four following report s :

Report (A5- 00 3 4 /2 000 ) by Mr St en z el , on behalf of the Committee on E mployment and Social Affair s, on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States establishing the guidelines for Community In iti ative Pro gram m es ( C I P s ) for which the Member States are inv ited to sub mit proposals for support under the EQUAL initiative ( CO M ( 1999 ) 4 7 6 - C 5- 0 2 6 0 /1999 - 1999 /2 1 8 6 ( CO S ) )
S ince Mrs M c C ar th y ' s f light has been delay ed s light ly, I propose that we hear from Mr D ec our ri è re first
( F R ) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commission ers and members of the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, I was given the task of draw ing up the European Parliament' s report on the Community In iti ative Pro gram me INTERREG II I
U pon refer r al to committee , we exam ined over a h und red amendments and, so far , 1 7 amendment s, some of which have already been presented in committee , have once again been tabled
B e fore discuss ing the cont ent of the resolution , I should like to inform you of the ele ments which I to ok account of and which guid ed my work as rapporteur
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative , found ed on the principle of trans n ational ity and innov ation
This programme constit utes a d ri ving force for development on the European sc al e
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives sch ed ul ed for the period 2000 - 2 00 6 , and is the one with the l ar g est budget for implement ation, i.e. EUR 4 . 8 7 5 b illion as opp osed to EUR 3 . 6 0 4 b illion at the present time
The INTERREG initiative , creat ed in 199 0 , is bu il t upon the wish to make the regions of Europe read y for a ' E uro pe without f ron ti ers ' in the context of establishing the great single market
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 199 4 and 199 6 , the INTERREG C I P has incorpor ated new strand s contrib u ting to the development of trans - E uro pe an transport and energy dist rib ution net wor ks
These programmes prom oted cross-b ord er, trans n ational and inter reg ional cooperation within the European Union by encoura g ing bal an ced development of the Community area
The INTERREG II I programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines iss u ed by the European Commission, purs u ant to the terms of European Community Reg ul ation No 12 6 0 de 1999 l ay ing down general provision s on the Structural Fund s, contin ues these measures
It is based on three strand s. strand A organ ises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and ex tern al b ord ers of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strateg ies which Member States ' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing . strand B govern s trans n ational cooperation between national , regional and local authorities in various Member States or applic ant countries regarding regional development, transport net wor ks and the environment
Member States, i.e. national author ities, are responsible for implementing this strand
Finally, strand C organ ises inter reg ional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strand s A and B and cooper ate in the field s of research and techn ological development, subject to consult ation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation
The new INTERREG programme, in the form in which we have received it, takes into consideration the needs en g ender ed by enlargement to the countries of East ern and C entral Europe and to is land regions and most rem ote regions
The Commission propos es red ist rib u ting the INTERREG funding as follow s : between 5 0 and 8 0% for strand A , 6 % for strand C , and the remain der for strand B , i.e. from 1 4 up to a m ax imum of 4 4 %
The European Commission draw s up the list of elig ible regions for strand A and strand B . It bas es its assess ment princip ally on the m ap of regions elig ible during the previous programm ing period
The most rem ote regions may benefit from support under strand B . The Commission draw s up a list of priority areas and elig ible measures which for strand A is not compreh ensive , but is compreh ensive for strand B . The Commission res er ves the op tion to , at a l ater d ate, put forward top ic s it con sid ers important to the exchange of experience and strengthen ed cooperation between regions, for strand C
The adop tion procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds
Pro p os als are dra wn up by Member States and are sub mitted for appro val to the European Commission, which chec ks their conf orm ity with the general guidel in es, adopted
These proposals must include a number of e lement s, an over v iew of the cross-border or trans n ational prior ities and strateg ies, a des c ri p tion of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indic ative financial plan
I regret that Parliament was not inform ed about the app ra is al of the previous programme, which would have en abled the new measures implemented to reach op tim um efficiency , but I ac know ledge that this was not an e as y oper ation. I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in , as the text was exam ined in parliament ary committee on 2 4 No ve mber last year and then on 2 6 J an u ary
In prom oting cross-b ord er, trans n ational and inter reg ional cooper ation, this cross - d is cip lin ary instrument is the very inc arn ation of a regional policy on the European sc al e intend ed to encoura ge harmon ious and bal an ced development of the Community ter rit ory
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the con ference on rural development held in C or k from 7 to 9 No ve mber 199 6 set rural development as one of the European Union' s prior ities since it is essential in order to maintain the exist ence and continu ed development of agric ulture , to provide farm ers with an environment contain ing the necessary inf ra st ruct ure and servic es, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life , di ver si fication and job cre ation
An integr ated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore need ed, cons isting of the following ele ments : an integ rat ed, mul ti - se ct or al approach , simp li fication of administ ra tive procedure s, improve ment of the partnership between European institutions and national and local act ors and protection of the environment
In its 1998 policy p ap er, Ag enda 2000 , the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based : the recogn ition of the mul tif unction ality of agric ulture and the need for an integr ated strategy for develop ing rural areas
The first principle means creating a new ' p act ' between farm ers and soci et y, making the farm er ' st e ward of the country side ' and ens uring that soci ety is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to saf eg uard the country side ' s rec re ation value
The second principle is based on the fact that now ad ay s many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the tra dition al agric ult ural sector , so that a complete development programme which integr ates rural development policies with agric ult ural sector policies needs to be implemented
In this way rural development is bec om ing a p ill ar of the C A P
The LEADER Community initiative was la un ch ed in 199 1 to promote a new b ot t om - up approach to rural development and to di ver si f y measures by ad ap ting them to local needs
The following objectives were set : impro ving the development potential of rural areas by call ing upon local initiative ; prom oting the ac qu is ition of know ledge in the rural development sector ; dis se min ating this know ledge to other rural areas
LEADER I appli ed to the rural areas cover ed by Structural Fund Objec tives 1 and 5 b , and 2 1 7 local action groups particip ated in it, with finan cing of EUR 1 15 5 million
LEADER II ( 199 4 - 1999 ) , for which a total e val u ation has , unfortun ately, not yet been comple t ed, had a w ider scope than LEADER I : there were prob ably over 8 00 bene fic i ar ies and the su ms alloc at ed, after re all oc ation of resour ces, prob ably amount ed to over EUR 4 0 00 million
In O ct o ber 1999 , following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II , the Commission decid ed to extend the initiative
For the 2000 - 2 00 6 period provision has been made , unfortun ately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 0 2 0 million , and an indic ative alloc ation for each Member State has been set
LEADER + di ff ers from the previous st ag es in that all rural areas will be elig ible . It is also more amb iti ou s, and better g e ared to the chall eng es which rural areas will have to meet
The main changes are as follow s : all rural areas will be elig ible to benefit from LEADER + ; the se le ction criteria for local measures will be more r ig or ous ; integr ated local development plans will be introdu ced as priority them es, such as the use of information techn olog y, impro ving the quality of life , and add ing value to local product s
I therefore appro ve of the continu ation of the initiative because , as I was say ing, it emphas ises the innov ative development strateg ies and because it is more amb iti ou s, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qu al if y as rural more flex ible so as not to p en al ise rural areas with high or low population d en si ties
I believe the net work ing system to be v ital for the exchange of information and s k ill s and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repe at that in order to be fully successful it must exp lo it inter a li a measures already in exist ence, such as the C ar re f our s
I share the Commission' s pre ference for the use of global grant s while urg ing, however, that the acc oun ting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and p ain st aking ly def ined
I regret the delay with which LEADER , as was the case with the other three initiatives , was presented to Parliament and for the k n ock - on delay this ent ail ed for the whole procedure
Finally, I am concerned by the p au c ity of the amount alloc at ed, if you consider , in addition , that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II
I would like to thank the Commission services for their help ful ness and cooper ation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Ag ric ulture for the contribution they have made through their amendments
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion deli ver ed as part of the process of consult ation on a new Community initiative , whose objective is to promote trans n ational cooperation and through it new m eth od s of comb ating all for ms of discri mination and in equ al ities in connection with the l ab our market
The report was a major undert aking because it also incorpor ates opinion s from four further comm itt ees - from the Committee on Ind ustry , E x tern al T ra de , R es earch and En erg y, the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, the Committee on W omen ' s Right s and E qu al O pport un ities, and the Committee on C itiz ens ' F reedom s and Right s, Justice and H ome Affairs
This Community initiative suc ceed s the two for er un ner programmes A D A P T and E M P L O Y M E NT and has a much small er budget of a round EUR 2 . 8 b illion
The initiative adop ts a completely new approach , which is to develop innov ative employment mod els within trans n ational g e o graph ical or sector al development partnership s
The intention is clear : t ar get ed projects are to be develop ed at trans n ational level , projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employ ability , ent re pr ene urs hip , ad ap t ability and equal opportunities
This objective is very much to be wel com ed and also meet s with a broad cons ens us in this House
In addition , EQUAL should fe ed into the N ational A ction P l ans for employment and its implementation should be able to be mon it ore d through these A ction P l ans
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives , URBAN , LEADER and INTERREG , is finan ced out of the Structural Funds
In my report I have t ried to redu ce ex ces sive administ ra tive exp end it ure and to build greater open ness and flex ibility into the system of development partnership s
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the form er T A O s, no new T A O s should be set up without Parliament' s appro val so as to prevent political responsibility from being pass ed down to the technical assistance level
N ever thel ess, technical assistance is necessary
Par ticular attention is also pa id to the dis se mination of results and le ar ning from each other by i d enti f ying best practice , with special emphas is on main st ream ing
I have end e av ou red to sec ure the w id est possible support for the report
This has me ant a redu ction in the number of amendments - from over 1 00 in committee to 2 2 for the pl en ary - which has also creat ed num erous opportunities for comprom ises
A comprom ise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seek ers
However, in this context , Madam President, to allow us to work out the detail s, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on W ed n es day
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to rece ive over wh el m ing support so that the Commission is also oblig ed to take into consideration the con stru ctive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropri ations for EQUAL in the res erve precisely so as to ensure that Members ' ide as were also ref lect ed in this Community initiative
In this connection , the European Parliament is also jus tif ied in ins isting that it should be possible to amend the them atic prior ities only after a further hear ing in Parliament
EQUAL should live up to its na me , and this is my firm intention
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a dis ad vant age in the European Union
It should prevent soci ety from sp lin ter ing
It should prevent exc lusion from being part of every day life
E ver y one should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regard less of their a ge , g ender or o ri gin
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report over wh el m ing support !
Madam President, it is in itself an achieve ment that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achieve ment that I am here t on ight because A ir France can cell ed my f light at 2 . 1 0 p . m. but I am here !
J ust a year ag o when the Commission produ ced its proposals a round Ag enda 2000 it a x ed the URBAN initiative
Y et we as poli ti ci ans k ne w that there was a ground s w e ll of support for continu ing this initiative into the year 2000
Parliament, therefore, can take cre d it for a successful l ob b ying c amp a ign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U - t urn
U r ban policy has always been at the fore f ron t of EU policy
In my Member State , for example, we are develop ing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government task for ce is look ing at the problems of urban commun ities
With e ight out of t en people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most de pri ved commun ities to t ack le the all too fam ili ar problems of de pri v ation, social exc lusion , job less n ess, crime , d ru g dep end ency and all the problems that are as soci ated with that
For example, in my own region , in M an ch ester , the URBAN Community initiative has been a t re m end ous success
URBAN funds have been inves ted in one of the most de pri ved ne igh bour ho od s in the U K , in M os s S ide
The M ill en n ium You th Par k project is help ing to get y oun g people re - eng aged in reg ener ating their own community and in addition to support for small business es and social policy we are begin ning to see a turn ar ound of a very de pri ved urban community
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the w ider community with an active communication and public ity c amp a ign in local su per mark et s and fam ous B ri tis h p ub s
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extend ed ac ross the EU in terms of communication and public ity
As regards the specific guidelines govern ing the initiative , they are broad ly def ined to give scope for local and regional di vers ity
We agree that they o u ght to be indic ative in nature , allow ing the m ax imum flex ibility to ensure that we t ar get specific programmes
In committee we are not in favour of redu cing the number to 5 0
We are in favour of redu ction over all but we believe that the ar b it r ary number of 5 0 is not the key fact or
In st ead , we should go for good - qu ality projects that can act as a c at aly st to effect change and renew al , to att ra ct in ward invest ment in terms of lo ans and v ent ure capital and to achieve a mul ti p li er effect
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reason able number of areas within the financial c e il ing of their alloc ations
In the design ation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indic at ors and sta tis tic s on de pri v ation and health to en able us to more effective ly t ar get the most affect ed areas
In the U K the local inde x of de pri v ation is a very good example of a w ide ly used standard and sta tis tic to help deter min e not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes
This needs to be ac know led ged as a to ol and resour ce in addition to the EU criteria
I would ask you to take on bo ard local indic at ors to help us do that
Our most de pri ved urban ne igh bour ho od s face a ple th or a of problems : high unemployment and often very low - p a id prec ar ious employment , po ver ty and social exc lusion
O ft en these problems are comp ound ed by po or health and h ous ing st ock and a culture of d ru g dep end ency
We therefore have un st able commun ities which are inf il t r ated with crime , d ru g - de al ing and g ang s
This is all too fam ili ar in many of our urban areas
All these comple x problems under min e the quality of life for our urban res id ent s, yet we have the potential in these areas to create grow th and pro s per ity
That is why again , in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Pro gram me should not mere ly provide a single solution to a single problem : these areas do not have single , " m on o " problems
In st ead , commun ities in urban areas should be encoura ged to present integr ated action plans to t ack le their specific urban problem s, using EU resources as a value add ed to local actions
I would like to see those actions extend ed to cover health and anti - d is c ri min ation, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty
The Community initiative means community involve ment. S ome of the most active and comm itted prop on ents and ag ents of change in our urban areas are local res id ents
We need to encoura ge them to particip ate in design ing and deli ver ing projects for these programmes
The time -s c al e therefore proposed by the Commission is very amb iti ous
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects deli ver ed on time but without local participation
The Commission must of course provide full disc l os ure and transparency concerning the se le ction criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disc lose the consult an cy net wor ks which are being used to deli ver the exchange of good practice
This is important in the interests of transparency and the over all effec tiveness of net wor ks
Finally, I should like to emphas ise that in order to address the problems fa cing the post - ind ustri al c ity we require local participation
We need to dep loy the energ ies of the une mploy ed, the under us ed s k ill s of you th and the experience of a ge to t ack le these problems
We shall there b y be able to rep la ce po ver t y, dep end ency and a li en ation with equ ity , initiative and participation
This will help us to rest ore the cre di bility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deli ver local action to s ol ve local problems
( I T ) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs M c C ar th y, has already point ed out , we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations
As we have he ard , the objective of URBAN is the prom o tion of innov ative strateg ies to promote economic and social reg ener ation in urban areas, bear ing in mind that 8 0% of the population of Europe li ves in c ities
C re ating a function ing urban environment in terms of social policy requ i res a policy of long -term job cre ation, action to combat po ver t y, measures to assist low -in come groups and old people , fa cili ties for ch ild r en, ra cial and e th n ic integr ation, better opportunities for particip ation, a t ar get ed public health policy including measures to prevent d ru g ab use and conc er ted crime pre vention measures
The Comm un ic ation from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approach es comb ining a r ange of economic , social , and inf ra st ructural measures
However, we must re me mber that, in addition to URBAN , a number of other Community instru ments are also available in the social sector : innov ative actions under Article 6 of the E S F regul ation, p il ot project s, particularly the new prepar atory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introdu ced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and main st ream E S F activities
As the Committee on E mployment and Social Affairs stress ed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recogn ise the need to exp lo it sy n erg ies in this context while avoid ing d up lic ation of mul ti p le funding
Wh ile , on the one hand, we believe that st e er ing comm itt ees should ensure that the various projects are co her ent and comp lement ary , we would on the other hand urge the Commission to re in for ce exch ang es of information and coordin ation between the dep art ments involved
N ot only is this coordin ation essential but, as we st ated in our opinion, exch ang es and the dis se mination of exper ti se and good practice must also be essential
Mr President, the importance of this initiative is increasing con st ant ly as economic and social problems in Europe ' s c ities int en si f y and the public feel s more and more out of to uch with the administration of its c ity or ne igh bour ho od
That situation will be comp ound ed by social rec l as si fic ations res ul ting from European Union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic reg ener ation and social cohesion of our c ities
A d d ress ing those problems is all the more urg ent in view of the mark ed sp read of c ities into the sur round ing areas and in view of the c ities ' hist or ical and cultural role
However, in order for such an effort to suc ceed it is necessary to sec ure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enl ist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affect ed by the economic and social crisis
H ere , we wish to stress the need for the bal an ced involve ment of women , and the ag en ci es that represent them , in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes
As the Committee on E qu al O pport un ities, we also stress the need to fin ance inf ra st ruct ures that will fa cil it ate prof ession al activ ity by women , main ly by harmon ising their prof ession al and fam ily commitment s, and more gener ally inf ra st ruct ures that promote solidarity between the gener ations, social solidarity
E ff ec tive implementation of this initiative could have a c um ul ative result because it could ins p ire sim ilar action at regional and local level s, th us increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day - t o - day life in real terms
Mr President, our committee wel com ed the prior ities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local commun ities and e th n ic min or ities and impro ved security and crime pre vention
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social reg ener ation of urban areas to go hand -in - h and with the cre ation of an at m os ph ere of to ler ance towards min or ities and therefore for measures design ed to redu ce r ac ism and xenophob ia to be an integr al part of programmes to be fund ed by URBAN
We considered that increasing public confidence by comb ating every day urban crime was one of the central tas ks of urban reg ener ation
Our committee not ed that innov ative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole ar ra y of measures including the incorpor ation of crime pre vention in to wn planning , action to prevent j u ven ile de lin qu ency , the re int eg ration of off end ers, and mod els for effective local cooperation between the various par ties invol v ed, for example the polic e, the cour ts and social services
We adopted our recommend ation un an im ous ly in the committee because we f el t that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successful ly - because , as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will suc ceed in ens uring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union en j o y peace ful co e x ist ence
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on E mployment and Social Affairs has with regard to the l ar g est of the four Community initiatives , INTERREG II I
It must also be possible to a consider able extent for social measures to rece ive support under INTERREG II I
In the light of the fact that 5 0% of unemployment in the Union is ess enti ally structural and given the particular sen si tiv ity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of un w el come m ig ration - this is not only reason able but imp er ative
The measures elig ible for funding list ed in An ne x II of strand A do also seem encoura g ing in this respect
In reality , however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integr ated approach es for social and employment policy aspect s
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inc lusion of increased number s of v oc ational training measure s, especially in areas with high level s of long -term and you th unemployment
E mployment policy measures should also be elig ible for funding under strand B , especially for the applic ant countries as part of the pre - ac ces sion strategy
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for app oint ments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local exper ti se required for these specific purp os es is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures bec om ing too ab st ra ct and therefore pro ving dis app o in ting
The fact that administ ra tive exp end it ure on INTERREG II I is - in my opinion - still ex ces sive is something which we can and indeed always must critic ise , although it al most seems to me as though this is un a vo id able with the Commission' s support programmes
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is f at al
It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simp li f ied as possible so that the social di men sion of the EU is once again given the importance which it des er ves
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism consider ed, among st other thing s, the report on LEADER + and, as a result , ag reed to support the process of dec entral isation in the management of action s, belie ving that that process could be effective on two conditions : that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community , and that Commission control m ech an is ms are u til ised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER + resources to support civil groups and organ is ations which are rel ated to those authorities
We ask for a guarantee that the decision -m aking bod ies for the projects are represent ed equ ally by three ele ments : political representatives and public administration s, companies and economic oper ator s, and social oper ator s, including un ion s and non- governmental organ isation s. We would particularly like to stress that there must be bal an ced represent ation between m en and women in all of these bod ies
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the prom o tion of strateg ies for sustainable development, whose positive effects would extend to a broad er g e o graph ical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integr ated into the development programm es, included in Objec tives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are loc ated
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER + , but we believe that it is necessary to concentr ate Community resources in the less -f av ou red regions in order to fa cil it ate the process of soci o - ec on om ic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not di ver t these resources towards objectives other than cohesion
The Committee belie ves that projects finan ced under action 1 should place value on the potential of end og en ous development, in particular based on local tra dition s, techn i ques and prac tic es, on specific produ ction and on the management of sustainable energy
The Committee support s the Commission proposal to concentr ate actions in small se lect ed areas and belie ves that, given the disp ers ed nature of many rural in h ab ited loc ations, the min imum dem o graph ic c e il ing for the se le ction of a project should be redu ced to 1 0 0 00 in h ab it ants
We believe it is necessary to coordin ate the development objectives and management m ech an is ms of actions 2 and 3 , finan ced by LEADER , with those of other actions finan ced by other Community programmes relating to inter reg ional and international cooperation and partnership , such as INTERREG , S A P A R , P H A RE , T A C I S and M E D A , in the same areas
Mr President, Mrs St en z el , ladies and gentlemen, before address ing the EQUAL report itself , I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based
The basic objectives of an EU - w ide employment policy are la id down in the guidelines and include employ ability , ent re pr ene urs hip and ad ap t ability
These objectives are obvious ly intend ed to make employ ees as use ful and us able as possible to the economy
However, the aim of an approach which really s ought to redu ce discri mination effective ly and in the long term would have to be people ' s s el f- d et er mination
On ly then does it st op being a question of economic us ability and start being about people having equal rights to sh a pe their own li ves
Mrs St en z el ' s report has , however, turn ed out very well , at least where the pres c rib ed guidelines are concerned
All asylum seek ers and refuge es are to be included exp lic it ly in the programm es, although this should be s el f- e vid ent
N ever thel ess the Con s erv atives voted against this in the committee
I would ask them the following questions : does your policy seek to mar gin al ise people ?
What is the idea behind pre ven ting people from working when they wish to do so ?
Do es this not stand in st ark contra dic tion to the guidel ine on employ ability ?
It is also worth mention ing that this is a main st ream ing programme, because there remain s a short coming in the report
Par ticular emphas is is given to the point that women ' s opportunities on the l ab our market o u ght to be impro ved and that to achieve this more c r è ch es should be bu il t
An y one who let s m en happ ily c li mb the care er l ad der and wor ri es only about ch ild c are pla ces without f igh ting against the way in which the work of rep rodu ction is sh ared out une ven ly has not - and unfortun ately that includ es women - under st o od the con cept of main st ream ing !
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its conclud ing discussion with no v ot es against and one ab st ention
I am deli ber ately st ating this at the begin ning of my inter vention to make it clear that there is in fact an al tern ative view to that of the committee responsible , the Committee on E mployment and Social Affairs
This cross - g roup support for the opinion is explain ed by the conclusion s, which are dev oted to the question of how issues rel ated to regional policy, transport and to ur ism can be comb ined with action to combat all for ms of discri mination and in equ al ities in connection with the l ab our market
The members of the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism of course also i d enti f y a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would critic ise : first ly, for example, the ins u fficient them atic guidelines la id down for the development partnership activities ; second ly, the fact that str ict se le ction criteria for e val u ating the project proposals will only be dra wn up only at a l ater stage by the Commission and third ly, the fear of ex ces sive administ ra tive and technical exp end it ure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bod ies
That is why a c e il ing needs to be set for administ ra tive exp end it ure
The committee based its conclusion s on these cri tical comments
We att ach ed particular importance to link ing the cre ation of new jobs for dis ad vant aged and exc lud ed people in the social sector , in to ur ism and in small and medium -si zed enter p ris es with prom oting the establish ment of new small and medium -si zed business es bear ing in mind the necessary economic structural change
D ove t ail ing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential require ment and a crucial pr ere qu is ite for at tain ing the objectives of the EQUAL programme
We fully support the innov ative approach towards set ting up development partnership s and organ ising the exchange of experience at European level as an integr al part of the EQUAL programme
The specific t ar get of d eri ving European add ed value b r ings the regional cooperation up to European level while re tain ing the cooperation of the various regional oper at ors
This is a good approach and that is why we have also support ed it
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been mentioned today that the first URBAN initiative was an un qu al if ied success
The fact that this initiative will now be continu ed in the form of URBAN II , al b e it with a small er budget , is something for which we have to thank individual , comm itted Members of this Parliament, including in particular - as far as I have he ard as a new Member of this Parliament - the rapporteur Mrs M c C ar th y, wh om I should therefore like to thank very much for her d ed ic ation and of course also for her report on URBAN II
A new fe at ure of the URBAN II initiative is that it has been t ail ore d to small c ities or part s of c ities
This is important because it is precisely small c ities which often find it hard er to access aid
And yet the problems which give r ise to the urg ent need for reg ener ation can be particularly ac ute precisely in c ities of this kind and th us have a prop or tion ally ad ver se effect
To increase the effec tiveness of individual measures the number of projects for URBAN II has been limited to 5 0
I think that it is important not to s tic k r ig id ly to this ar b it r ary qu an tit ative restric tion and inst ead to le ave it to the Member States to dec ide between how many projects they each wish to di vid e the support funds to which they are en tit led
In any case it is necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it is not only areas of large c ities which are again in rece ip t of the support
There URBAN II would only be a d ro p in the o ce an ; its success would be doubt ful and the whole thing would be a f l op
J ust as important in my view is not to broad en the se le ction criteria for URBAN II too much and th us water them down
It is precisely a str ict ly def ined list of criteria which is essential if the programmes which are fund ed are to be mod els and be trans fer able to other problem c ities in the future
F rom my own experience of local government in an old industri al ised region b es et with problem s, I should like , in conclusion , to ask for your particular support , ladies and gentlemen, for two points in the report which al ong side the social policy aspect s are , I believe , essential
Firstly, environmental protection is essential for sustainable urban development and the inc lusion of this aspect should therefore be a general require ment for a project to rece ive funding
Secondly, pre ven ting and comb ating r ou tin e urban crime and crime rel ated to d ru g deal ing must start at local level
These are essential step s towards increasing the quality of urban life and must therefore also play a central role in the URBAN II initiative
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur s, who have man aged to produ ce excellent report s in just a short time
However, critic ism has been v o ic ed within my group over the tim ing of the prepar atory work of the committee
The report s are l ate, and, in addition , they were very has ti ly discuss ed by the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism
A good opportunity to discuss the result s, good prac tic es and short com ings of the ear li er programmes was therefore lo st
Our group is k een to stress the importance of cross-border activ ity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focus ing on areas outside the European Union
S uch important areas include the B alk ans and the A d ri atic region , but, in my opinion, we should not i gn ore cooperation with R us si a either
Our group would once again like to ra ise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphas ise the importance of better coordin ation of the INTERREG , T A C I S , I S P A and P H A RE programmes
This coordin ation is at present lack ing, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it
We here in Parliament are w a iting for the Commission to give the committee a more detail ed expl an ation of the issue as soon as possible
It is of dec is ive importance to get local bus ines s, organ is ations and other play ers involved in the practical implementation of programmes
E x p eri ence show s that projects of cooperation need better planning and clos er monitoring and need to be gener ally more successful
Pro ject s have often remain ed h alf -f in ish ed, and their efficiency has been dra ined by administration and bureauc ra cy
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be comm itted to projects and fulf il their share of the agreement
Our group is review ing a few amendments that were reject ed by the committee
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the expl an atory statement s, has deal t ad m i ra b ly with the issue of the min imum su m of EUR 5 00 per in h ab it ant as per the Commission' s guidelines
It will not work as an a ut om atic t ar get , but must be appli ed in the t ar get area according to pre v ail ing conditions
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusion s have to dra wn
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds
H ere , projects cover ing only one region or one country will not rece ive support ; they will have to cover ne igh bour ing regions in two or more countries
Un fortun ately this is only true for part of the mone y, that is only for the b ord ers within the EU
But it is precisely the regions on b ord ers with third countries which need an oper ational instrument to fo ster cross-border cooperation
The regulation pre t end s that there is one , but there is not
The fact is that the Commission has not amend ed the regulation for years, although Parliament has been call ing for it to do so for some time
The practical consequ ence for these regions in the immedi ate future is that support for border areas will again be down gra d ed
S ince 199 6 , Parliament has been call ing for a joint fund to be creat ed for cooperation with third countries in order to resol ve difficulties
N ot hing has happen ed !
The difficulties are once again being allow ed to pers ist , to the det ri ment of the regions concerned
Parliament is here renew ing its call for an improve ment and for cross-border cooper ation, and we look forward to a joint fund being creat ed and to the regulation being amend ed once more in cooperation with the other Commission ers
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of p aper - p us h ers !
Mr President, a third of EU money is inves ted in funds for all kind s of development caus es
A cc ord ing to my group , this is excellent if , as a result of this, de pri v ation within regions, to wn s and population groups is e li min ated or if health and the environment impro ved
That is a question of solidarity and progress
But dis hing out increasing amount s of money is no guarantee for impro ved sp ending
The local c ouncil s and regions where the money end s up have since g ain ed practical experience
They find it is extremely difficult to sp end the money on their most need y caus es
An y thing rel ated to economic grow th and inf ra st ruct ure us ually sc ore s quite high ly, but social go als and environmental caus es often cannot count on appro val
S ince there is great un c ertain ty sur round ing the way in which rules are inter p ret ed, local c ouncil s and regions have now st ar ted to enl ist the services of exp ensive bureau x
The task of these exper ts is to g au ge to what extent European Commission official s would be prepared to appro ve plans
In some cas es, I get the imp ression that it is not about solidarity or al le v i ating the most des per ate problem s, but about prop ag and a and up ho ld ing v est ed interests in exchange for the European Union' s b less ing
It seems that the key go al there has become the con struction and p ain ting of prop ag and a p an els ad ver tis ing the fact that such and such a project has been co -f in an ced by the European Union
To o much money is w ast ed on prop ag and a and inves tig ation bureau x , consult ation and control , and a great deal of money end s up back in the country where it was colle ct ed in the first place
A fter the plan n ed ac ces sion of new Member States with their 1 00 million in h ab it ant s, the pro s per ity level of which is at one third or two third s of the a ver age level of the current EU Member States, this s qu and er ing will gener ate even more prot est
In the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, the Con f eder al Group of the European United Le ft was in agreement with the draft s man of the opinion, Mr N ogue i ra R om á n , on LEADER . He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas
If there is a ch o ice between inves ting in innov ation projects or in jec ting most of the funding into bring ing on de pri ved areas, we would op t for the l at ter as this does the most to benefit equ ality
A fter all, innov ation in areas that have already g ro wn pro sp erous is pay ing di vid end s even now and taking place without European funding
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of ne p o tis m and ab use of power within regional and local c ouncil s
The emphas is is on local groups in which the author ities, non- p ro fit -m aking organ is ations and pro fit -m aking companies j o in for ces
The discussion has cent red on the alloc ation form ul a to be appli ed
In this respect , one of the var i ants considered is remin is c ent of the D ut ch po ld er mod el , the struct ur ally plan n ed cooperation between government , trade un ion s and employ ers ' organ is ations
Let us not for get that ele ctions for local c ouncil s and regional parliament s are held so as to represent the entire population
So , re ally, these bod ies should already provide for a bal ance, and take into account the wishes of the un ion movement and environmental movement in the process
My group wel com es the fact that the un ion movement and environmental movement are express ly given their own r ol es to play , as their in p ut in soci ety is important in our view
This could prevent local governments that are function ing in a short -si ght ed or ins u ffic i ently democratic way from ne g le c ting their d ut y of in p ut from the very start
But the fact that we now fear ab use of power and ne p o tis m indic ates that, unfortun ately, democracy is not fully function ing yet
One of the objec tions is that, due to the restric ted role of the elect ed bod ies, business es g ain more inf lu ence
As long as the economy does not we igh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a pro fit for the benefit of a few , it is question able as to whether democracy f un ctions better under the r ule of employ ers than under the r ule of local c ouncil s
We believe in ' one man , one vote ' more than ' one share , one vote '
Mr President, there are economic f ron ti ers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of good s, person s, services and capital is fully oper ating at this time
But for the internal market to work effective ly and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe, of which there are over 1 00 , can economic ally compe te within this very chall eng ing environment
S ome areas within the European Union are economic ally very strong and he av ily ex ceed the a ver age inc ome per cap it a
There are po or regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fa b ric of their econom ies so that they can compe te within the European Union structure
That is wh y, when we look at the EU Fin an cial P ers pe ctive between 1 9 8 9 and 199 3 , and 199 4 and 1999 , we find such a large prop or tion of the EU budget was put a side for the administration of the European Regional De velop ment Fund and the European Social Fund
There are tw in problems that still remain for many regions in Europe : first ly, the lack of ad equ ate inf ra st ruct ure in terms of road , water treat ment fa cili ties and rel ated transport net wor ks ; second ly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat you th and long -term unemployment , which is a con st ant social problem in many urban and rural part s of Europe
There must always be a commitment to ens uring that we do not only build a Europe of the c ities al one . We need to ensure that job cre ation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small - and medium -si zed enter pr ise sector in rural part s of Europe as well
The c ore aspect s of this debate this even ing rel ate to the oper ation of the EU initiative programm es, na me ly, the new INTERREG II I initiative , EQUAL and the LEADER + sch e me
B et ween these three programmes there must be a clear demonst ration of the commitment of the EU to prom oting cross-border development, comb ating the problems of long -term unemployment and supp or ting rural development sch em es
Mr President, quite a few to wn s and c ities within the European Union have to cont end with de pri v ation
The Member States do not always have su fficient means at their disp os al to address this de pri v ation ad equ ately
This is why it is use ful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary , give addition al support under URBAN
O ver the next se ven years, the Commission' s proposals concerning URBAN will ent ail a redu ction in both the Community budget and the number of areas stand ing to benefit
In common with Mrs M c C ar th y, I have to note that the number of areas has been d r as tic ally redu ced
It is des i ra ble for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to deter min e the number of projects themselves within the conf ines of a certain budget
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stat ed, URBAN is there to support and comp lement national policy
In order to gener ate ext ra means if necessary , I think it is entire ly l og ical to turn first to the Member States and priv ate invest ors
Con sequ ent ly, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the G re en s, as b or ne out in the committee meeting
In addition , I am of the opinion that funding for a to wn or ne igh bour ho od , especially where Community contribution s are concerned, should inc enti v ise
Structural support is said to cause subsid y - d epend ence
We would then be over re ach ing ourselves
I would like to fin ish off by making a general comment on INTERREG
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions
When projects are implement ed, it is also important that they do not contra ven e general Community legislation
A cc ord ing to the report iss u ed by the Court of A ud it ors on the year 1998 , this is not an im ag ined risk
H ence our amendment in order to prevent contra dic tions between general policy and act ual projects
B e fore I begin I will take the li ber ty of express ing my con st ern ation at the way in which Austria has been pre j ud ged by 1 4 Council representatives
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pr un ed to a total of four
I welcome the continu ation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accord ed
However, the delay ed present ation of the draft guidelines has caus ed a number of problems
The regions have not been su ffic i ently involved in the prepar ation of the guidel in es, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds
There is no direct tr an sition between INTERREG II and II I , the practical consequ ences of which are un c ertain ty in terms of planning and g aps in funding
That is a sh a me because it threat ens perf ect ly sen sible projects
When INTERREG is implement ed, it will need to be coordin ated and sy n ch ron ised with the other financial instru ments concerned
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds dep loy ed
However, problems will ar ise in particular from the fact that under P H A RE , for example, funds are man aged on an ann ual basis and alloc ation of appropri ations is project - re l at ed, where as INTERREG funds are mul ti ann ual and are alloc ated on a measures - re l ated basis
This will cause practical problems in the future , and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effective ly
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER pro ved itself to be an effective instrument to initi ate innov ative develop ments and p il ot projects both within and outside rural areas
The pres erv ation of this Community initiative in particular , in the form of a new ver sion - LEADER + - is therefore great ly to be wel com ed
The new LEADER + programme now co vers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater pos sib ili ties for potential projects
It is important for there to be coordin ation between LEADER + and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordin ation with other national support sch em es is also just as important
O ver la p between support sch em es must be avoid ed and at the same time it must also be possible to exp lo it any sy n erg istic effects
In this context the aim of st e pp ing up net work ing between elig ible z on es under LEADER is very welcome
Ag ric ulture is one of the cor ner st on es of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative . In the same way , through the LEADER initiative , structural change in agric ulture can be support ed by creating new jobs in rural areas
At t ention must be pa id in the LEADER + programme to all the sect ors of the economy in rural areas ; only a comb ined effort will re ap an op tim al result
LEADER must now move into the implementation ph ase
The oper ational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which imp lies practical and effic ient administration of applic ations and comple tion of the application appro val process as quickly as possible
F ive months are provided for this
That seems to me to be rather too long
E ff ort s should be made here to achieve short er tim es
B ec ause any one who develop s a project and has it read y will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible
D es pite all the de light over the re work ing of this Community initiative LEADER + , I do still have one further concern . In its proposal the Commission call ed for an obs erv atory for the LEADER + programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented
For me this ra ises the following questions : who will work there ?
How will these people be se lect ed ?
Wh ere , above all, will the required money come from , and where should this obs erv atory be loc ated ?
I do think , though , that the LEADER + programme has not g ot a p en n y to sp are on addition al administ ra tive task s, which in the n orm al course of event s would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case
In addition , experience from other field s where obs erv ator ies have been set up show s that, ap art from rather d ub ious ly creating job s, they are not of any great benefit
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulf il its monitoring d u ties direct ly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER + programmes run sm o oth ly
As s ess ment and public ation are part of this, and it has of course ass um ed responsibility for these in the past
Mr President, the majority of the border s, which have di vid ed Europe for cent ur ies, were ar ti fic i ally creat ed, s ep ar ating single g e o graph ic sp ac es and creating serious disp ar ities in terms of bal an ced development and cohesion
Our internal border s, or what remain s of them , no longer cause w ar s, but they do continue to gener ate economic back ward n ess, social b ar ri ers and a lack of cultural communication between the pe op les of Europe
The Community ' s institutions are oblig ed to work towards over coming these border sc ar s, which contra d ict the spirit of European un ity
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is bas ed, by means of the INTERREG initiative , on terr itor ial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the out er most regions of our contin ent
INTERREG has always been at the hear t of a g en u ine Community policy for regional planning and a t ru ly po ly c entr ic no tion of our European ter rit ory
Al though the European Parliament support s this initiative , our only regret is that we have to appro ve a resolution on it before we have seen any e val u ation of INTERREG II
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third ver sion further , since other wise we would be j e op ard ising the success of various projects and the continu ity of the projects which are currently under way . The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local , regional and national authorities which have particip ated in the co f in an ced projects
The people who have particip ated in this initiative have le arn t the importance of le ar ning together , of innov ation, of sh ar ing projects and good prac tic es and of understand ing and to ler ating each other
There are many inter es ting questions relating to it, the monitoring cent re , the principle of concentr ation e t c . However, I would like to concentr ate on the management bod ies
We must create joint , inter reg ional and trans n ational management bod ies, in which all local and regional author ities, as well as economic and social oper ator s, play an active role
There must not be any repe ti tion of cases of par al le l projects on both s id es of a border
We must create a cross-border culture , and to this end we must be innov ative with regard to administ ra tive cooper ation, im ag in ative ly over coming existing b ar ri ers and over coming the difficulties pos ed by the differ ing level s of compe t ence in each Member State , in each region and each m un ic ip ality
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication
D uring deb ates in committee , we have also point ed out the difficulties involved in coordin ating INTERREG with other ann ual or b ian n ual financial instrument s, such as M E D A , T A C I S or P H A RE
This Parliament' s motion for a resolution has been very att en tive to these difficul ti es, making proposals cap able of s ol ving them to the Commission and set ting reason able de ad l ines for making the necessary changes
Mr President, my reason for w an ting to contrib ute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative , in Ireland in particular , has been quite successful and I am k een that the European Union make a further contribution in that area
It is a s ad fact that there are many h und red s, if not th ous and s, of commun ities in the European Union su ffer ing very sever e po ver ty and dis ad vant age
E ven in Member States and c ities that are extremely we alth y we have large number s of people living in g h et t o s, in situ ations where there are in ade qu ate fa cili ti es, where sch o ol ing is very po or , where the ph y s ical inf ra st ruct ure is under - de velop ed and where d ru g s and other ph en omen a are r if e
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstr ate that it has a role in help ing the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstr ate that the Union work s for these citizens and their fam ili es
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland , as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries
It was quite s low in get ting off the ground there , but it was s low because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local exper ti se in develop ing this initiative
It would be very e as y to have these programmes develop ed quickly and on time if you brought in outside prof ession al exper ts but that would under min e the whole purp ose of the URBAN programme
I should like to make one further point before I conclud e : we should ins ist where this money is being alloc ated and where this programme is being develop ed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy
This , unfortun ately, is not the case in Ireland
I app la ud the innov ative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of int e gra ting discri min ated groups into the l ab our market
The development partnership s are a very c le ver ide a, even though they are experi ment al
I have two major concern s, however, about the development partnership s
They should be ac ces sible to small er group s, ac ces sible for them to be able to dev ise , implement and monitor the programmes
We need to have a w ide e lement of flex ibility within the programme
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simp le l ang u age and not using j ar g on , so that it bec om es ac ces sible to everyone
I am g l ad to see that this was ac cep ted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simp le l ang u age at all
My second concern was that some discri min ated groups have specific problem s, for example, dis abled people ' s access to the work p la ce
Pro ject s should also specifically address this problem . These concerns must be look ed at while set ting up the programmes
I certainly intend to do that with organ is ations and groups in my constit u ency in the W est M id land s
I now turn to the cont ro ver si al issue of asylum - se e k ers and refuge es
Al though I am not in favour of those refuge es who have been ref us ed refuge e stat us and threat en ed with rep at ri ation, having access to EQUAL , I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum - se e k ers and refuge es
It is only fa ir and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else
Thank you, Mr President
L adies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore
This does not happen all that often and it is g ra tif y ing, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key ele ments in the Union' s rural development policy
It must be point ed out that these programmes have not only been instrument al in struct uring regional planning , but have also been v ital instru ments for economic and social cohesion in often v ul ner able areas such as , for example, areas experi en cing dep op ul ation
It must be stress ed that in order to become elig ible under the LEADER programme, local oper at ors have comb ined for ces, deb ated and prepared projects
These programmes have , therefore, been important ch ann els for particip ative democracy , the r ational e of the citizen for Europe
So , the con cept for LEADER + should re tain all the positive aspect s of previous programmes
One urg ent question is therefore raised : wh y, when this programme has been successful ly run for t en years, is LEADER + still cl ass ed as experi ment al ?
A re there so many other European sch em es which can bo ast 8 00 specific o ri gin al experi ments which were particularly successful ?
For how much longer is the Commission going to le ave LEADER at the experi ment al stage inst ead of bring ing it on line as part of the general con cept of main st ream ing of rural development ?
M ore over , I w on der at the redu ced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restric t LEADER +
At a time when , Commissioner, after S e at t le , we European s are f igh ting on the ground s of mul tif unction ality in rural development project s, why should we conf ine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from su fficient ?
As an ec olog ist , let m et tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more di ver si f ied and many - sid ed approach es
In this connection , the Commission is propos ing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only c and id ate countries
A better solution would be , as indeed the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism suggest s, strengthen ed coordin ation between LEADER + and the Community cooperation and partnership programm es, such as INTERREG , P H A RE , S A P A R D or M E D A
The fact is, show ing solidarity with East ern Europe, is all very well , but it is not enough
The tra dition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the s ou th , particularly the countries a round the M ed iter r an e an , must not be ab and on ed
Therefore , once more , we can stress that what the area of agric ulture and rural development really needs is cod ec ision . C od ec ision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type , which require cooperation and cross - d is cip lin ary application
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments
We are deb ating the planning ph ase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substan tive and complete app ra is al of the previous period
This is not very good at all
Pro gram m es and objectives us ually turn out to be far too amb iti ous and their results are not always satis fact or y, while the lack of transparency and comple x ity of the plans often allow consider able scope for m ism an age ment and even fraud
The Community initiatives we are deb ating could play a positive part subject to certain pre con ditions
They must , however, not be sub ordin ated to the objectives and as p ir ations of a more gener ally ne g ative economic and social policy, but must develop their own s el f- s u fficient role
For example, ad ap ting EQUAL to the objectives of employ ability and the flex ib il isation of l ab our relations trans f orm s this initiative into a new ver sion of local employment contra ct s
E xt ending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union ent ail s the risk of mar gin al ising de pri ved areas even more , to the benefit of more develop ed areas
The INTERREG initiative must include elig ible areas with special emphas is on border areas, is land s and both m ount ain and non- m ount ain areas, such as the pre f ect ure of Ar t a in G ree ce , whose o m ission from An ne x I of the Commission' s communication is i ll - con sider ed
Mr President, rural development has been i d enti f ied by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area , and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible , Commissioner F is ch ler
Our response to rural dec line has come l ate in the day , but I supp ose better l ate than never
F am ily farm ing is now recogn ised as central to the European agric ult ural mod el and is an objective to be address ed, certainly within the time -s c al e of Ag enda 2000
In my view the next five years will dec ide the future of th ous and s of mar gin al fam ily far ms
It beh o ves all of us to do every thing possible to ensure their sur v i val
As the Commissioner know s, farm ing al one will not be su fficient to ensure the sustain ability of rural commun ities
For this reason we need the coordin ation of all policy areas cap able of imp ac ting positive ly on rural development
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative
It provid es the opportunity for local commun ities to i d enti f y their development potential and become active ly involved in address ing those problems
The vol un t ary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully app re ci ated
Y et , through LEADER , there can be no doub ting its effec tiveness as an integr al part of broad er EU and national policy
In conclusion , while wel coming Commission appro val for LEADER + , I am concerned about the time delay between the end ing of LEADER II and the comm ence ment of the new programme
I urge you to look serious ly at this problem
A b re ak in continu ity will have serious consequ ences for the programme and certainly a dis ru p tive effect on vol un t ary and prof ession al work ers
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG II I initiative , and po in ting out that I to ok part in the vote on Mr D ec our ri è re ' s report within the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, I should like not only to express ly re iter ate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG II I B , with the Commission' s recogn ition of activities contrib u ting to the rest or ation of l and s c ap es run down due the level of pr ic es in the agric ult ural sector , a sector in which many as soci ations, especially c y ne ge tic , are already making en orm ous invest ments in my own country
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism, particularly and pri m arily in dep l or ing the fail ure to integr ate the most rem ote regions into strand A of the programme or in comm en ting upon the lack of prec ision in the se le ction criteria for the implementation m eth od s for strand II I C and, fin ally, in reques ting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Ob s erv atory for cross-b ord er, trans reg ional and inter reg ional cooperation
I should further like to express major res erv ations with regard to the ex ag g er ated t end ency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG II I and II I B , invol ves as soci ating environmental protection exc lu sive ly with the development of N at ur a 2000 , which I think is often an ex ces sive ly ab st ra ct means of saf eg uard ing ec os y stem s, from which us ers are in dang er of being exc lud ed or sever e ly restric ted
Finally, if the Commission and the rele vant Council s of Minister s per mit , I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the proced ures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, be y ond that, of sim ilar initiatives
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the process es of fra m ing and implementing the programmes concerned, other wise it will be difficult to deter min e and def end their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs St en z el , very w arm ly for all the efforts she has made to m ast er this very comple x subject matter on behalf of all of us
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attemp ts to comb ine so many old programmes and yet aim s to view them in a different light , doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds
This is an ar du ous task
On ly, the number of people affect ed by these programmes has not really d ro pp ed
This is why it is so hard to st ri ke a bal ance, not only between the different countries or the different comp on ent s, but especially between the different groups list ed in the programme, and in fact this is what has pre oc cu p ied us to d ate
C om ments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another
I , for my part , have focus ed on the position of the hand ic app ed and the e ld er ly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been over lo ok ed al t og ether if it had not been for the European Parliament dev oting special attention to them
Al though a few other groups have been mention ed, it is the Member States, in particular , which are on the look out
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large prop or tion of the entire programme for one comp on ent, namely refuge es
I would , therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a bal ance is st ru ck between these different groups
It should not be the case that one Member State , under the pre te xt of call ing on the subsidiarity principle , can dec ide that all funding should go to one group
I think that this will have to be mon it ore d close ly because other wise we will end up in that situation against which Mr M e i j er has w arn ed us so v e he ment ly, to w it , that v est ed interests will em er ge and that people will think that the money is their s to sp end
This is not the case !
It has to be red ist rib ut ed time and again . It should be used for innov ative projects and it should not completely dis ap pe ar into the Fin ance Minister ' s t re as ur y funds
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here
I believe that the remain ing problems that we have fa ced within this Parliament, and which in large part st em from the fact that it is so difficult to st ri ke the right bal ance, can be s ol ved
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to j o in in the comprom ise that is being conclud ed here in this Parliament, main ly with a view to reach ing a bal ance
I would just like to under line this - the situation is, of course, a little prec ar ious - Parliament has , for the s ake of con ven i ence and saf et y, pla ced the EQUAL programme on the back b urn er for the time being , so that Parliament has yet to be pers u ad ed of the way the funds are to be dist rib ut ed
I believe that this is actually a good thing
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is some wh at un c lear
The R ul es of Pro ced ure do not sh ed any more light on the matter and that is exact ly why this back b urn er is extremely use ful
Mr President, there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative prom ot es efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union
However, I should like to stress INTERREG ' s particular importance for the B alk an area , where political develop ments and h os ti li ties over the past few years have had major economic rep erc us sion s for ne igh bour ing countries and especially for my own country , G ree ce , which is the only Member State on that long -s u ffer ing p en in s ul a
For G ree ce , for the ne igh bour ing countries It aly and Austri a, but also for Europe as a whole , the social and economic rest or ation of the B alk an s, bring ing political st ability , is a v it ally important matter
So far , some B alk an countries have received aid from the P H A RE and Ob n ov a programm es, while others have not
D uring the new programme period , in view of enlargement and bear ing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instru ments and regul ations, such as I S P A and S ap ard , it is considered absolutely essential to coordin ate the funding of all three strand s of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries
A cc ord ing ly, we welcome the rel ated refer ences in Ch ap ter 7 of the European Commission' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG
The efforts to coordin ate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equ ally, and I say that because in the M E D A programme during the last period some problems a ro se which have to be over come , so that we can have equal treat ment for all the third countries particip ating in that programme
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter - st ate cooperation z on es has taken no account of the M ed iter r an e an ' s g e o graph ical p ec u li ar ities, which would jus tif y the cre ation of a special z one for co ast al and is land regions
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and is land cooperation when z one planning next comes up for review
I end by stress ing the need for the European Union to pers ist with such initiatives , which st ri ve to e li min ate in equ al ities between our regions, and to fo ster their harmon ious development
And since this is St . V al en tin e ' s day , as a form er M ay or of a regional c ity , I propose that we should all dec la re our lo ve for all the European regions which need that lo ve
Mr President, Commissioner F is ch l er, rural development can and must t ack le the problem from three different an g les : pres erv ation of job s, st e wards hip of the country side and, not least , local culture , because that is of the u t most importance
On ly if the population can st ay in the country side will the quality of life in the country side also be per man ently ass ure d
We can obs erve the consequ ences of m ig ration from the country side in several areas of the Al p s and they are dev ast ating
But I w arn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the country side
And ne ither should we create struct ures which are re li ant on subsid ies and which will be dep end ent on them fore ver more
To really guarantee sustain ability - a bu z z w ord which has , since it g ain ed new currency , become re lative ly de vo id of mean ing, but we all know what we mean by it - what is need ed, among st other thing s, is an integr ated approach in the country side to ward s, for example, to ur ism and agric ulture
The invest ment needs to be v ision ary
Y oun g , cre ative individual s must be made to feel an att ach ment to the country side
If they all le ave then nothing much will go on there any more
N one of us think much of the principle of ind is c ri min ate, all - round dist rib ution , and the p il ot projects need to act , as it were , like av al an ch es and t ri gg er other sim ilar projects
I would be in favour of supp or ting s el f- con tain ed c y c les of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had short com ings here and there , over all they were certainly positive
I should like to ask that we consider gr an ting d er og ations not only in the N ord ic countries but also for m ount ain ous areas - the Al p s, the P y r ene es and the S i er ra N e v ad a, from where I have just ret urn ed - in respect of population si z e and d ens ity
Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refuge es
L ast week , we had a very imp as sion ed discussion about the form ation of the Austrian Government
T od ay , we are already discuss ing the Austrian co al ition government ' s policy on refuge es because Mrs St en z el , who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represent s Austria ' s govern ing cons erv ative party and its policy
The most start ling aspect of her o ri gin al report was that she want ed to limit aid to the small group of refuge es cover ed by the G ene v a Con vention , that is to say so -c all ed qu ot a refuge es or U N refuge es
In act ual fact, it is the other refuge es, namely those outside the qu ot a and those not cover ed by U N aid , who need aid the most
The Committee reject ed this discri min atory proposal and decid ed that all refuge es should have a place on the EQUAL programme on i den tical conditions
S ome members of the Committee , however, support ed Mrs St en z el ' s proposal and word ings
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider ' s politic s are already cas ting their sh ad ow over this Parliament
It is therefore cru cially important that the Ch am ber should be as emp h atic as it pos sib ly can be in establishing the fact that all refuge es are to have a place on the EQUAL programme
I want , fin ally, to say that I had certain mis g i ving s last week when we discuss ed the form ation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discuss ing and critic ising its policy on refuge es, I have no mis g i ving s
I hope that the Ch am ber will be just as comm itted this time
Mr President, during the last EU Fin an cial P ers pe ctive from 199 4 to 1999 , when there were 1 3 different initiatives in oper ation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative
The fact that the next r ound of Structural Funds 2000 - 2 00 6 includ es the INTERREG initiative is I believe , a very clear indic ation of the importance which is att ach ed to it by national EU Member States
The INTERREG I programme between 1 9 8 9 and 199 3 and the INTERREG II programme between 199 4 and 1999 have pro ved an absolute success in terms of bri d g ing clos er social and economic development between border ing Member States
C om ing from the border c oun ties in the n orth - w est of Ireland , I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have play ed and I am de light ed to welcome INTERREG II I
The Commission is alloc ating 6 7 million p ound s towards the INTERREG II I programme, which will be sp ent on continu ing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Rep ublic of Ireland and N ort her n Ireland
The European Union has play ed a key role in develop ing the border count y region in Ireland over the years
The European Union is the single l ar g est contrib ut or , with 8 0 million p ound s to the Intern ational Fund for Ireland . The European Union contrib utes 7 5 % of the Pe ace and R ec on ciliation programme
All in all, INTERREG , the Intern ational Fund for Ireland and the Pe ace and R ec on ciliation programme have all play ed an important role in the develop ing peace process
Mr President, I am taking the f lo or to speak about INTERREG , but I shall conf ine myself to a few critic ism s, which will clearly also en able me to keep to my spe aking time
We have all sp ok en fa v oura b ly of this programme ' s confirm ation and of the ext ension of the sect ors it co vers to include the field of trans n ational and inter reg ional cooper ation, in addition to cross-border cooperation
However, this does not b l ind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 5 0 - 8 0% - will be res er ved for cross-border cooper ation, for INTERREG II I A . Therefore , we still think the decision to con so lid ate the current areas of cooperation in this strand , regarding the se le ction of elig ible regions, is wr ong and contra d ict ory
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and ac know ledge Parliament' s position in practical term s, and not just with a form al t rib ute
C ross -b order cooperation contin ues al most exc lu sive ly to be an issue concerning l and l ock ed areas and, where excep tions have been made for maritime areas, their se le ction is not transpar ent and they often su ffer from comp ens ation from other Community policies
This discri mination is much more serious for is land s that have a regional stat us that can only be link ed to areas of an exc lu sive ly maritime nature
This is in line with on go ing discri min ation, which i gn ore s Article 15 8 of the Treaty on is land regions with regard to cohesion policies
M ore serious still is the fact that this is occ urr ing while i gn or ing the new situation as soci ated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inc lusion of regions such as M al t a
This has given r ise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions elig ible to include the N U T S II I S ic ili an pro v in ces which have a f ron ti er with M al t a and to include all the regions of the A d ri atic which share a f ron ti er with B alk an regions
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satis f action I have in no ting that the most rem ote regions, including the French over se as dep art ment s, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG II I initiative , open ing up new pers pe ctives for their cooperation with other countries in their g e o graph ical area , even though it is true that more could have been expect ed, particularly with regard to access to the various strand s
For a long time, prob ably a sur v i val of our col on ial her it age , our regions have f i x ed their attention on the European main land , i gn or ing and even sc or ning their clos est ne igh bour s
That time is now past
Our regions have become aware of be l ong ing to an environment that they are conn ect ed to , not only in g e o graph ical terms but also in terms of their culture and the hist ory of their pe op l es, h ence the int en se ly expressed as p ir ation to become more de ep ly ro oted in this environment
This increased aw ar en ess does not, however, affect i den tit y al one
It is fo ster ed by a fa ir app ra is al of our as se ts
So , for example, the is land of R é un ion is loc ated on a trade a x is between the countries of s ou ther n A f ric a and those of s ou th - e ast A si a
It cannot aff ord to remain outside the regional all ian ces being for ged in this area , l est it mis s out on a hist or ic opportunity , and the same appli es to our regions in the C ar ib b e an
At last we are conv in ced that our y oun g people may start to see an end to the tra g ic unemployment , the sour ce of so much des p air , if we can exp ort to ne igh bour ing countries the know - h ow which we have g ain ed than ks to the oper ation of the European structural funds
INTERREG appropri ations may be used to make our regions into ver it able European Union bri d ge he ad s into these g e o graph ical areas, gi ving it world w ide scope
I am c oun ting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to alloc ate ad equ ate resources for effective action
Mr President, Commissioner s, I great ly welcome the pos sib ili ties for increased trans - E uro pe an cooperation under INTERREG , but my concern is that the proposal off ers fe wer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas
I understand the Commission' s own concern that dist ance may pro ve det ri ment al to effective cooperation
N on eth el ess, there are many maritime areas between which link s are already established
V ar ious local authorities a round the N orth S e a provide a pri me example of this
INTERREG could well allow en h ance ment of such cooperation
In consequ ence, I seek some small ad j ust ments to the guidelines to provide a little more flex ibility and to acc omm od ate the way s in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B . These ad j ust ments include cl ar if ying the pos sib ili ties for cooperation between maritime areas and per mit ting greater development of practical and vis ible project s, particularly those of an inf ra st ructural kind
S uch measures will put maritime and ins ular areas on an equal fo oting with other areas of the EU . I hope for their adop tion
Mr President, our group wel com es the h or i z on t al th r ust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a B ri tis h M us li m ph y s ic ally dis abled in some way you no longer have to ch ose which c ateg ory of discri mination you be l ong to as a t ar get group : you can use your exper ti se and experience to s ol ve problem s, rather than being def ined as the problem
There is a lot of exper ti se within the rele vant organ is ations which des er ves to be sh ared
We also welcome the recogn ition of the need for e val u ation and the dis se mination of best practice for the t ight ening up of the trans n ational level
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exc lud e even further some of soci ety ' s most exc lud ed, by aim ing for a very n ar row defin ition of " re f uge e "
My group will not be supp or ting those amendments
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seek ing to introdu ce greater flex ibility , run the risk perhaps of obs c uring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative
Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN o ri ent ated towards a more integr ated approach which attemp ts to s ol ve inter re l ated problems
Y et , there is some risk of d il ution of effort . If we purs ue too many objectives , our over all effec tiveness su ff ers
Of course, every inst ance of a de pri ved urban area is a s ep ar ate case
But there is a common fact or , a hard c ore , comp ris ing unemployment , the res ign ation or with d ra w al of public services and the dis ap pe ar ance of small and medium -si zed enter p ris es, both comm er cial and other kind s
I would wish URBAN to be o ri ent ated main ly towards provid ing ans w ers to those caus es of urban de pri v ation
For this, of course, central policy must inter act and be coordin ated with development policy, so that the l at ter too can be re or ient ated and can work sy n erg istic ally with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an a li b i for its own short com ings
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall conf ine my obs erv ations to Mr D ec our ri è re ' s report
The INTERREG Community In iti ative Pro gram me is an extremely important to ol in terms of the development and regional planning of European terr itor y, most particularly with reference to effective ly taking into account the relations hip between the cent re of the European Union and its out ly ing regions
INTERREG must , therefore, be an instrument prom oting terr itor ial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two - or even three -s pe ed European ter rit ory
It is obvious to me that the regional and local author ities, and their represent ative bod ies, the Committee of the Reg ion s and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the c le are st way possible and at the ear li est possible opportunity fra m ing this programme
Inde ed, I am for ced to obs erve that this was not the case when the Commission d re w up its communic ation, p ub lish ed on 1 3 O ct o ber last year
E ven though I appro ve of the general guidelines of INTERREG II I , I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordin ation between this programme, finan ced by the E R D F , and the other ex tern al cooperation fund s, including in particular the European De velop ment Fund , intend ed for A C P countries
In this connection , I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism for adop ting one of my amendments add ing the E D F to the list of these funds
The most rem ote regions, particularly the four French over se as dep art ment s, must be able to coordin ate INTERREG II I and the E D F in order to fund , in turn , cooperation projects with their A C P ne igh bour s in their res pe ctive g e o graph ical areas
F urther more, I would ask the Commission to ple ase recon sider the limited opportunities that have been offer ed to the most rem ote and is land regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG II I , just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the R E G I S programme d ed ic ated to such is ol ated regions has been d ro pp ed
Finally, in conclusion , I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding alloc ated to strand C , for inter reg ional cooper ation, even though the add ed value this off ers the Community is u nd en i able
Mr President, my st ar ting point is the EQUAL report and equ ality between m en and women , although I must ad mit that it is some tim es hard to talk about this issue , which has a feel ing of d é j à v u about it when you are my a ge , in any case
Un fortun ately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equ ality
A b re ak th rough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, how ever
For me , equ ality certainly does not mean that both par ties to a mar ri age work the whole time and hand the ch ild r en over to a n ann y, a li as an immig r ant who has not had the opportunity to ob tain another job
If that is the case, we have not progress ed one little b it since p ag an tim es
No , equ ality means that we all particip ate in both working life and fam ily life
Un fortun ately, develop ments are not mo ving in that dire ction
On the cont r ary
I think , therefore, that paragraph 7 contain s something very central , i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a t es ting ground for develop ing and prom oting new way s of deli ver ing employment policies
One can only hope that it suc ceed s
I should just like to say, in accordance with the R ul es of Pro ced ure , that if I am not here when the Commission respon d s - not that I have asked any specific question s, but I should non eth el ess hope that the Commission has been pay ing attention - then that is because the Committee on W omen ' s Right s and E qu al O pport un ities is meeting to discuss women in the decision -m aking process at the same time as the present debate is going on
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has man ag ed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II , is one of its success st or ies, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER +
One of the reason s why it has been so successful is that the basic con cept of the LEADER programmes ar ous ed substan ti al interest in activities among st the population concerned
I am g l ad that LEADER + is to remain true to this under ly ing con cept
There is a problem , however, which we need to address together
B ec ause LEADER is a kind of work s h op with a b ot t om - up approach , a h uge number of ide as have come to f ru ition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be b rand new or as successful as they once were
And because of the programme ' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be d ro pp ed from LEADER
That is wh y, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have pro ved to be out stand ing are not su d den ly dis con tin u ed ; inst ead the ide as which have pro ved to be worth wh ile need at some stage to be trans fer red into the standard programmes as a re li able , positive comp on ent of our support to rural areas
Of course this is also the basic idea
It is to take new ide as and tr y them out in LEADER , with the particip ants on the ground , with the local organ is ations on the ground , with many non- governmental organ isation s, with the ch ur ch es, with all those who have help ed actually to get new ide as up and run ning in rural commun ities
H ere we must ensure that the good sch em es, those which are really excell ent, are then some h ow trans fer red into rural development policy to saf eg uard the future of this la ud able work
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organ is ations and sec tions of the population which get involved really are ac cep ted
There should be no attemp t to have one or other organ is ation, which is just being form ed with a view to contrib u ting a new idea and is not yet so well know n , p us h ed a little on to the s id el in es, say because of official local or regional policy
Ha ve fa ith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far
At the begin ning it is some tim es a little like ch as ing a r ain b ow if we say that a plan is too ide al istic
And then when the work and the action start something em erg es which the official policy, including ourselves at this level , could never have im ag ined would su d den ly have develop ed so well
That was the ch arm of LEADER , and that should ple ase not be lo st !
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which high light s the need to dis ting u ish between actions to combat discri mination against women and actions to combat discri mination against min ority groups
W omen are not a min ority and often su ffer dou ble discri mination as members of min ority groups as well as because of their g ender
This is why specific action for women is need ed, as well as main st ream ing
The report address es this and propos es int e gra ting action to achieve equ ality between women and m en in all aspect s of work ; it also recogn ises the importance of working with local and regional bod ies which are those clos est to the people to help ensure that all project results are main st ream ed
The involve ment of vol un t ary and community groups will also be an essential in g re di ent of the EQUAL initiative and the projects
The development partnership s within the them atic field s, which are refer red to in Amendment No . 2 2 , would en able even the small er organ is ations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative
My group will be supp or ting Amendment No . 2 2
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubt less of great importance
In addition to the objectives it is working to ward s, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000 - 2 00 6 programm ing period li es in its add ed value from the view p oint of what is now the im min ent enlargement of the European Union to include new East ern European and M ed iter r an e an countries
In my opinion, it is precisely in anti cip ation of this de ad line that the European Union should st ri ve to redu ce disp ar ities between regions and put an end to the is ol ation of border areas
Inde ed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an inter f ace with the applic ant countries that are going to j o in the Union
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the u t most importance , and that the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism has sub sequ ently taken up
They call for the areas elig ible for cross-border cooperation to be extend ed to all regions of the A d ri atic , as well as to the S ic ili an pro v in ces which have a f ron ti er with M al t a - an applic ant country - which, in e x p lic ab ly, are not currently included in strand A , An ne x 1
I am confid ent that Commissioner B arn i er and the President of the European Commission will d u ly consider Parliament' s position on the matter , in accordance with the C od e of Con du ct
There are fundamental adv ant ag es for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applic ant countries and to support border regions
Finally, it is to be h op ed that greater coordin ation will be s ought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programm es, which are significant for ex tern al policy, as a v ect or for greater integration and for the joint dra f ting of programmes
Mr President, Commissioner s, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an out ri ght success due , in particular , to the great flex ibility of the administ ra tive management between the Commission and the local oper at ors
It is, I think , regret t able that the Commission could not make a sim ilar assess ment of LEADER II , regarding the quality of the project s, the qu an tit y of appropri ations sp ent and, most espe ci ally, the dem o tiv ation of some local oper at ors in the face of the administ ra tive and financial un w ield iness they enc oun ter ed
I am pleased to see , however, that under LEADER + , new resources have been alloc ated to help ing rural terr itor ies to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development
I feel it is important to put special emphas is on tr ying out new way s to ra ise the prof ile of the nat ural and cultural her it age and to strengthen the economic environment , in order to promote employment
The time is now right , I think , to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of trans n ational cooperation
It is inter es ting to note that all rural areas may be elig ible for LEADER II
N on eth el ess, if the opportunity for Member States to deter min e the areas, within the scope of this initiative , remain s available , then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focus ing of resources and prior iti se projects in the less pro sp erous areas
There must , of course, be transparency regarding the se le ction criteria for projects and local action groups
I also feel there are ground s for ens uring , in particular , that the financial ch ann els of States or local authorities are not behind the delay s in pay ment which may have caus ed some L A G s to become b ank ru p t under LEADER II
Mr President, as a Member from one of the out er most regions, I must point out that this is a very special after n o on as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives , URBAN and INTERREG
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aim ed, first ly, in the case of URBAN , at impro ving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the po or er part s of various European c ities, and, in the case of INTERREG , at fa cil it ating cohesion and recogn ising the di vers ity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the out er most regions in strand s B and C
Li ke the rapporteur, we dep l ore the fact that it has been exc lud ed from strand II I A
With regard to INTERREG , we are very happ y that there is a reference to the cre ation of a European monitoring cent re concerned with cooperation
I would like to thank the rapporteur s, particularly Mr D ec our ri è re , for his sen si tiv ity towards the regions and for ac cep ting our amendments
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analys ing this after n o on , I would like to concentr ate str ict ly on one of them , that is, the URBAN programme
It is a fact that we are deb ating this programme today because the European Parliament ins ist ed that this initiative should be maintain ed
The Commission proposed rem o ving it and other initiatives , but Parliament' s proposal and the sen si tiv ity of the Commission itself at the time l ed to the URBAN initiative being re tain ed
I believe that we should be pleased about this
But what were the Commission' s argu ment s, from Commissioner Mon i k a W ul f- M ath ies and Dire ct or - G ener al E ne k o L and ab ur u in particular , for e li min ating the URBAN programme ?
It s argu ment was one of priority
The urban question is so important that we cannot t ight en our be l ts and under val ue it with a programme which has such a small budget
T od ay the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achie ved something important , that dis ting u ish ing mark of the European Union call ed the URBAN programme
However, I would like to address Commissioner B arn i er and support the argu ment of Commissioner W ul f- M ath ies and the Dire ct or - G ener al , because I think they were absolutely right
The urban di men sion must be incorpor ated much more de ep ly in all the structural funds
The amount of budget required by our c ities - where 8 0% of the European population live and which increasing ly represent both the best and the wor st of what we have in Europe, I believe , clearly indic ates that the European di men sion should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an ex cu se not to analy se in detail , not to prior iti se and, therefore, not to introdu ce an inf in ite ly greater budget ary contribution into programmes which affect the c ities, by means of European funds
Therefore , I do not believe I need to rest ate the number of fact ors which demand this invest ment in urban areas, fact ors which are on the agenda , and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sen si tive in this respect
In wel coming the cross - se ct or al approach em b od ied in the new EQUAL initiative , it is crucial that the programme address es the dis tin ct for ms of discri mination which m il it ate against dis abled people in particular : ph y s ical b ar ri ers in the work p la ce aff ec ting those with limited mo bility , vis ual information system s which exc lud e b l ind work ers, working system s which effective ly close the do or on people with le ar ning difficulties or with m ent al health problems
O r gan is ations of dis abled people and dis abled people ' s non- d is abled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision -m aking
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraph s 1 0 and 15 of the resolution , to ensure that Member States cannot i gn ore any one t ar get group
D is abled people have too often been left off the list
B ec ause dis abled people do not form one h om og en ous group - for example many de a f people see themselves as a l ing u istic min ority d en ied respect for their own l ang u age and culture - it is necessary as st ated in paragraph 9 to en able some partnership s to be def ined which are specific to a particular dis ability or other group
EQUAL remain s crucial also to regions like my own , in the e ast of En g land , outside the princip al funds of Objective I . We have had an ext ra inc en tive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent rec ord in response
F orm er A D A P T projects r ange from the C O RE project , which has develop ed new supp ly ch ain s for the car industry in B ed f ord s h ire , to projects to ra ise standards in small business es in H er t f ord s h ire in E s se x
We have seen the N O W project help ing 7 0 women to ret urn to work in S u ff ol k , many of wh om were able to come and share the results of their experience direct ly with us at the European Parliament in Brus sels
EQUAL remain s important to us because it is precisely in re lative ly more pro sp erous regions that low er -s k ill ed jobs are being sh ed, which can be an important first des tin ation for those discri min ated against in the l ab our market
Finally, a word on INTERREG
It really is quite non s ens ical that partnership s set up in 199 4 are being ro ll ed over now to the exc lusion of new inter - reg ional link s
D uring this period the p ort s of G reat Y arm ou th and H ar w ich on the E s se x - S u ff ol k - N or f ol k co ast have la un ch ed significant new transport ation and economic link s with partners in the N ether land s
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2 , which would ensure flex ibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime b ord ers
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the information of the House , Mr President, I should like to make a cl ar ific ation
Ch ance ll or Sch ü s sel ' s government will maintain the refuge e policy of the form er social democratic government l ed by Ch ance ll or K li m a
There is no change in refuge e policy in Austria !
R ural areas make up over 8 0% of the EU ' s ter rit ory and 2 5 % of the population live in them
As a farm er and Member of Parliament, I have always end e av ou red not to look at agric ulture in is ol ation but to see rural areas as a whole
I att ach particular importance to adop ting an integr ated approach towards rural development because I am conv in ced that only cooperation link ing up all people from all w al ks of life in rural areas will per mit them to be active and att ra ctive pla ces to live for everyone ; I refer , in short , to the mul tif unction ality of rural areas
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER + programme because of its compreh ensive nature
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual z on es elig ible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU
This ac ross - th e -b o ard approach is sen sible because the programmes for rural development are also structure d in this way
In the future , funding will no longer come from three funds but from the E A G G F G u id ance sec tion al one
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the E A G G F is supp osed to be an effective financial instrument
G reat er prec ision in the se le ction process will lead to greater effec tiven ess, because the money should not be s qu and er ed rec k less ly
In addition , I should particularly like to emphas ise the point which off ers an approach towards creating an integr ated and environment ally f ri end ly development strategy
There is great potential for future job cre ation in rural areas here and we must exp lo it this if we wish to offer f res h pro s pect s to people living in the country side
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farm ers
LEADER + should supp lement already existing programm es, avoid over la p s and d up lic ation of finan cing and th us contrib ute to a process of development which is as compreh ensive as possible
In this way , LEADER + can , together with the programmes under Reg ul ation ( E C ) No 12 5 7 / 99 , con so lid ate the second p ill ar of the C A P even more effective ly and produ ce the best possible benefit s for the whole of the country side
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always p rou d of the f us s that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examp les of our work : it was creat ed following an initiative in Parliament
The Commission would have ab ol ish ed URBAN , but this time Parliament d re w the longer st ra w
It is good that URBAN is to continue , as it has had good results at local level
The problems in Europe ' s urban areas are get ting wor se ; for t un ately, we now have cons ens us with the Commission
The majority of the population of Europe live in c ities, and their problems are among the most press ing within the context of regional policy and very comple x matters in themselves
There is an im men se risk of exc lusion
In many c ities in France and En g land there are now s l um s, b reed ing ground s for many s ort s of problems
N one of us want s S ou th Am er ic an type fa vel as in Europe
We have to act now , before it is too l ate
Our c ities are also of dec is ive importance for Europe ' s economy
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe : our economy does not support the individual su fficient ly, n or is it su ffic i ently d y n am ic
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to att end to the problems of our fe llow - ci ti z ens and our environment
This is not policy ; it is life ' s simp le l og ic
It is good that sp ending has become focus ed, as other wise the bu c ks h ot get s sc at ter ed to the four w ind s
N ow we have to concentr ate on s ol ving problems in small and m id d le -si z e to wn s and c ities, as they do not have enough resources
In this way we will also be able to spe ed up matters in sur round ing rural areas ; it is often for g ot ten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand
The basis for all this is that we should be encoura g ing individual innov ation and ent re pr ene urs hip , as group action be g un by the individual will help rev ital ise an area intern ally
G r an ting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two fe et is like carry ing water to f ill up a d ry well : there will be enough to d r ink for a while , but tomorrow the well will be d ry again
Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG II I , European cooperation policy is enter ing a new ph ase
Our attention is no longer focus ed exc lu sive ly on internal b ord ers but also on ex tern al on es
In the context of global isation and cultural open ness which ch ar ac ter ise the current situ ation, the European Union needs instru ments that will allow it to strengthen its link s and communication ch ann els with ne igh bour ing regions, particularly in East ern and S ou ther n Europe
The Union' s b ord ers must no longer be an ob st ac le to bal an ced development, but - on the cont r ary - an opportunity , a bri d ge to more f ru it ful cooperation
B y means of amendments adopted in committee , Parliament has t ried to supp lement the Commission' s work , by including new ele ments in the list of areas t ar get ed for aid , and in particular ex tern al border areas and maritime border areas in S ou ther n Europe
In its draft guidel in es, the Commission ac know led g es that these b ord ers require greater attention than they did in the past . This is on account of the process of enlargement to the e ast and that of greater integration with the M ed iter r an e an countries
As President Prodi too mentioned when out l ining the strategic objectives for the period 2000 - 2 00 5 , bo os ting the B ar ce l on a process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG II I initiative will be able to make its contribution to the purs u it of this strategic objective
In congratul ating the rapporteur on his excellent work , we can but hope that the Commission will d u ly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward , in accordance with the commit ments made under the C od e of Con du ct on the implementation of structural polic ies, and that it will confirm , with f it ting amendment s, the trans f orm ation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal red ist rib ution to an opportunity to bo ost and en h ance relations with ne igh bour ing countries
Mr President, from this year until the year 200 6 a round EUR 200 b illion is available for the Structural Fund s, but only 5 ¾ % is set a side for the Community initiatives , INTERREG , LEADER , URBAN and EQUAL
That is a redu ction of 3 ¾ % comp ared with the previous C I s
No more than EUR 2 . 8 b illion is provided for EQUAL , as Mrs St en z el ' s bal an ced report makes clear
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tas ks all the more a st on ish ing
How are prior ities supp osed to be set here ?
There is agreement on the principle that mar gin al is ation, discri mination and in equ al ities on the l ab our market should be redu ced
Trans n ational strateg ies are intend ed to make it possible for dis ad vant aged groups to have access to jobs
I have no sy mp ath y for amendments once again back ing the T A O s
C ri tic ism of the previous Commission' s work was particularly sever e, leg iti m ately so , with regard to these T echn ical As s ist ance O ffic es
Our Committee on E mployment and Social Affairs was , after all, in over all ch arge of analys ing consider able short com ings and fail ures to carry out chec ks in cases rel ated to L E O N A R D O
The Commission cannot therefore be re lie ved of direct responsibility or the task of carry ing out ins pe ctions under EQUAL either
It can only appro ve Member States ' proposals if they fulf il all the criteria : first ly, integration through sector al and g e o graph ical development partnership s, where b y the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account ; second ly, the system atic involve ment of the oper at ors concerned - the local , regional and national author ities, training institution s, un i ver si ti es, N G O s, the two s id es of industry and the priv ate sector - with the aim of creating a d ur able partnership , and third ly, m eth od s and mod els of ind is p ut ably innov ative ch ar ac ter
The Commission must therefore be the guarant or of the strategic framework for prom oting ab ility to work and quality of work , of the assess ment of results and of the effective communication of best prac tic es
On ly then will it be possible for the des ire d mul ti p li er effect to be achie ved
Mr President, I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the C A P
On 2 6 O ct o ber 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line inform ing the public about the C A P
This proposal will rem ove the current budget line B 2 - 5 1 2 2 and create a new budget he ad ing B 1 - 3 8 2
A ctions which promote understand ing between y oun g farm ers and the EU and also create strong er link s with EU c and id ate countries and the outside world are important
Therefore I am put ting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contribution s of this type of programme
G i ven the need to encoura ge y oun g farm ers to continue in farm ing it is v it ally important that they are well -in f orm ed about develop ments in the common agric ult ural policy
In f orm ing and training y oun g farm ers at European level is v it ally important
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentr ated on the development of know ledge among st European y oun g farm ers
Reg ard ing information and tra in ing, in the past this budget line has been alloc ated for inform ation, communication and training
But the Commission is now propos ing that training should no longer be includ ed. I feel that training should be included where it provid es rele vant information at European level about the C A P
S uch European training is one e lement in ens uring that y oun g farm ers have the necessary know ledge of the C A P to make s ound business decisions for the future
Therefore I am put ting forward three amendments
I would urge Parliament to support them
Mr President, I am taking the f lo or to express my opinion, dra wn from my experience of m un ic ip al administ r ation, that the URBAN projects should , or rather must , have a three f o ld purp ose : first ly, to promote the rest or ation of inf ra st ruct ure and hist or ic , old and perhaps d il ap id ated areas of c ities
Secondly, to promote and sti m ul ate economic activ ity and social life within these hist or ic cent re s, within these old qu arter s of our c ities
There is little point in having st re et s which are now w on der ful ly l it , with new p ave ment s, with new ly pa ved road sur f ac es, all wh ite w as h ed and be au ti ful , if we are not able to f ill them with activ ity and, therefore, employment
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of fin ance or aid to the different social oper ator s, but rather also of se le c ting those projects which are aim ed at employment , or to put it another way , projects which will t end to favour the cre ation and prom o tion of jobs
Th ird ly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should princip ally be aim ed at the complete re h ab il it ation of people and fam ili es, because man is not made for the law , but rather law is made for man
These areas of our c ities are often home to single - p ar ent fam ili es, e ld er ly people who rece ive a p ension and no longer carry out produ ctive activ ity , and fam ili es fa cing difficulties ; some tim es they are fam ili es which have bro k en down and which are exc lud ed from main st ream soci ety
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects
If we have success in this three f o ld sense , I believe that these fam ili es, these people , these European citizen s, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because , u l tim ately, the c ities will increasing ly come to play a lead ing role in European life
( F R ) Mr President, before my f ri end s and fe llow Commissioner s, Fr an z F is ch ler and An n a D i am ant op ou l ou , in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest , I would like to end e a vour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG , which many of you have brought up and discuss ed
St ra ight away I should like to express my than ks to the rapporteur s from the comm itt e es, from all the comm itt e es, but also to the speak ers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speech es and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives
This is particularly true of what Mrs M c C ar th y said about URBAN . I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we o w e h er, for all you o w e her as far as this is initiative , as well as , more gener ally, all we o w e Parliament
I am mind ful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and support ed the continu ation of this initiative for the reg ener ation of urban areas in difficul ti es, in favour of sustainable urban development, invol ving at the same time this integr ated approach , which we value , to hand le the economic , social and environmental aspect s sim ult an e ous ly
S ome other points of agreement high light ed in Mrs M c C ar th y ' s report, the effec tiveness of this instrument through the concentr ation of funding and a cri tical m ass for inter vention , the h or i z on t al oper ation which we think more con du ci ve to dis se min ating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, fin ally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programm es, on the basis of a real partnership
Ha ving mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission' s proposals and Parliament and, having stress ed my great interest in hear ing the various contribution s, I should like to answer a few of the critic is ms and a few of the sugg es tions which have been made , with ap olog ies if I cannot att rib ute each of the questions to the speak ers by na me
I think how ever that you will all recogn ise your own comments
First ly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the m ax imum th res ho ld of f i ft y to wn s, which a number of you term ed ar b it r ary
I can understand your concern
I have therefore asked my services to be will ing to consider a reason able increase in the number of to wn s elig ible under the URBAN programme condition al upon certain guarant e es, first ly on concentr ation - I am think ing particularly of the t ar get areas which must have a min imum of 2 0 0 00 or , in excep tion al cas es, 1 0 0 00 in h ab it ants - and also upon the cri tical m ass of funding : we must keep to EUR 5 00 per in h ab it ant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear , and so that it does not res em ble a s ort of sc at ter ing of resources which would have no real imp act either for citizens or for m un ic ip al ities
That is my initi al response to the th res ho ld question
Reg ard ing a second matter , now , relating to the addition al criteri a, which should be taken into consideration in se le c ting dis ad vant aged areas. H ere , too , I am will ing to demonstr ate greater flex ibility and to consider other rele vant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 1 1 of the guid ance project
Th ird point : specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speak ers mentioned them - women , but also immig r ants and refuge es, must be env is aged
This concern , ladies and gentlemen, li es at the very hear t of our URBAN initiative , and I am will ing to re w r ite the text , if necessary , in order to make this m ess age clear er yet
Reg ard ing URBAN , I should like to conclud e with the implementation procedure and mention , first of all, the se le ction procedure
S ome speak ers want ed it to be less bureauc ra tic , more transpar ent, and to avoid red und an cy in terms of the projects and funding
L adies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear : in the context of subsidiarity , the se le ction of z on es or m un ic ip al ities elig ible for URBAN is pri m arily the responsibility of the Member States
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is will ing to avoid any un j us tif ied bureauc ra tic over lo ad , but we cannot give up the practice of chec k ing the rele v ance and quality of the proposed programm es, indeed you would be the first to critic ise us if we did
A second obs erv ation, the time limit s for the sub m ission of programmes and the possibility of sub mit ting a planning supp lement in addition to the programmes
I have no objec tion to the idea of sub mit ting a planning supp lement joint ly with the main programme
This cannot , however, be ground s for an ext ension of the o ri gin al time limit
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months
This time limit , which indeed is i den tical to the one we grant ed for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 D O C U P s, should n orm ally be ad equ ate, I feel , for draw ing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be def ined at a l ater stage
With regard to URBAN , I should like to conclud e with a final obs erv ation
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be conf ined to the URBAN initiative
I agree completely
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Minister s for regional and urban planning , a concern to which I dev ote myself , that in the D O C U P s and the C S F s in the planning which we are currently st ar ting to negoti ate, my concern , as I said, that, ap art from the URBAN initiative , urban issues should be address ed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programm es, and I believe I can express both our aw ar en ess of such issues and also our commitment to include them , be y ond the scope of URBAN , in all structural fund programm ing
But , as for the future , since we must look a he ad , I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical term s, and also to see what our experience will be and what less ons we can le arn , because pl ain ly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be , for future financial pers pe ctives , a new European regional planning policy
I am not for get ting , and we cannot for get , that 8 0% of the citizens of Europe today live in to wn s and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important
Let me repe at what I have said, we shall be most att en tive to the inc lusion of urban issues in all structural fund programm ing
I should now , Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Fr an c is D ec our ri è re , in the same way that I thank ed Ar l ene M c C ar th y, for the quality and rele v ance of his work
He stress ed a number of point s, with which we may indic ate our agreement , as many of you did too - the importance of this trans - E uro pe an cooper ation, with its three strand s, cross-b ord er, trans n ational , inter reg ional ; the add ed value to the Community provided by INTERREG , its cl arity in relation to the general framework of the structural fund s, and the t ru ly cross-border and trans n ational strengthen ing of elig ible programmes and oper ations ; the importance of common struct ures and what , in discuss ing another debate which begin s today, the Intergovernmental Conference , I term ed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen , and here , with INTERREG , than ks to INTERREG , is a way to strengthen common spirit through common struct ures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity ; the importance of partnership in guarantee ing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as priv ate sector as soci ations and economic and social partners
Ha ving made these general obs erv ations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG
The first rel ate to the tim et able and the cont ent of this initiative
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too l ate a d ate, stress ing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be inter ru p ted
It is true , I ad mit it, and you are well aware of the reason s, ladies and gentlemen
There is a delay in adop ting the INTERREG guidelines in Mar ch or A pri l 2000
I accept this ; I take note of it as you do
I not e, however, that the Member States and the regions are already active ly prepar ing the programmes for INTERREG II I and indeed the guid ance project was dist rib ut ed over three months ag o now
I also note that elig ibility for exp end it ure shall be ac cep ted from the d ate that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available ret ro ac tive ly back to 1 J an u ary , if the programme is presented before 3 0 A pri l
So much for the first comment
As to the second comment : regarding the non- com p reh ensive list of measures elig ible under strand B , I wish to inform you, to confirm , that I have asked the Commission to accept the inc lusion of other specific subject s, particularly in favour of small - and medium -si zed business es and of cultural her it age , in the list of sch em es elig ible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a compreh ensive one
Th ird point : inter reg ional cooper ation, the importance of strand C . The Commission sh a res the obs erv ations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C , inter reg ional cooperation
As your rapporteur has request ed, I shall s end you the detail ed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand
F our th obs erv ation : the European Ob s erv atory and the possible use of a technical assistance offic e
As you request ed, I have decid ed to rem ove all refer ences to the use of a technical assistance offic e in the text until the out come of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service out s our cing system s
But , ladies and gentlemen, if we do rem ove every reference and any rec our se to a T A O at a l ater d ate then this will have a consequ ence and that will be an increase in the number of official s ' jobs needed to do this work , because some b od y will have to do it and I cannot keep red ep loy ing the same sta ff inde f in ite ly, at a time when our d u ties are increasing with the pre - ac ces sion structural instrument ( I S P A ) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropri ations for which I am responsible , often in partnership or on terms of c ore s pon sibility with Member States, are mon it ore d better , with dis cip line and transparency
N ow to the implementation of INTERREG , a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential elig ibility under strand A , ' c ross -b order cooperation ' , of sch em es in the A d ri atic , on behalf of S ic ily or for the most rem ote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understand s your concerns and takes note of your reques ts on these various points
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorpor ate a specific priority into the trans n ational strand B : ' int eg r ated cooperation of maritime and is land regions ' , so as to cover , in what I think is an appropriate f as h ion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions
In addition to this one over t ure there is a second which we have already suggest ed to the Member States : greater financial flex ibility between strand A and strand B . Th an ks to these two over t ure s, especially the first , I can say that the Commission is will ing to exam ine the case of It al ian regions and regions of third countries a round the A d ri atic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG , and with other instru ments too , as soon as they become available
I have decid ed, in the end , that the most rem ote regions, to which I att ach particular importance , will be given special priority in the context of the trans n ational strand of INTERREG , with a cooperation strategy which will aim at impro ving their link s with their ne igh bour s and other Member State regions
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the E D F , particularly for the C ar ib b e an and the Ind ian O ce an
All this should make it possible for us, ap art from the Objective 1 appropri ations and also with them , to confirm the role of ' ac tive f ron ti er ' of the Union
I adopt and whole h ear ted ly support this political objective that the se ven most rem ote regions of the Union are actually active f ron ti ers of the Union, even if , or precisely because , they are rem ote and loc ated in other regions of the world where we must bring our inf lu ence and our action to bear
A not her point : the coordin ation between INTERREG , P H A RE , T A C I S and M E D A
It is true , once again , and I accept this objective ly, that there are still real legal problems
I do not want to min im ise these , but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with c and id ate countries is concerned, even if the problems rel ated to the management proced ures and to the sc al e of the projects still remain
The Commission must continue al ong these l ines
I am making a person al commitment to do so
An initi al joint P H A RE / C I P committee is to meet in F e b ru ary to assess this coordin ation, and let me confirm my att enti ven ess and avail ability with regard to this, together with my colleagues and fe llow Commission ers V er he ug en, P at ten and P ou l N i els on
Finally, on the subject of technical assist ance, on which your rapporteur and several of you comment ed
It goes without saying that the Commission will ad h ere to the terms of Article 2 3 of the general regulations regarding technical assist ance, if it is indeed assistance intend ed to be an instrument use ful to structural policy in general
A cc ord ing to the general regul ations, however, any technical assistance sch e me which can cla im a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 2 0 , and not Article 2 3
This means that the c e il ing of 0 . 2 5 % mentioned in Article 2 3 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance
I att ach great importance , ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of dis cip line and transparency , to our non eth el ess re tain ing some financial strand s for matters relating to the exchange of experience and inform ation, and not to prop ag and a, and to the implementation of net wor ks ens uring good communication of best practice within the Union
My conclusion regarding INTERREG , Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulf il a real need and every thing that has been said is pro o f of this
They also fore s h ad ow a real European regional planning policy within our enl ar ged Union
The Commission att ach es the gre ates t importance to this, just as you your selves do
I remain at your service in order , when the time com es, to present the report of previous planning which you request , but also to keep you inform ed reg ular ly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning
R e pe ating my than ks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Ar l ene M c C ar th y and Fr an c is D ec our ri è re , I should like to point out that these two initiatives li e within a financial framework with which you are fam ili ar : only EUR 7 00 million for URBAN , but this is better than nothing ; EUR 4 b illion 8 00 million s for INTERREG
So we are working within this framework and not outside it
On the subject of these two initiatives , then , with the light they c ast on future strategic and political think ing regarding regional planning and on future financial pers pe ctives , let me express our great interest in this con stru ctive dialogue with the European Parliament and its comm itt ees
E ver y thing that I have just said, ladies and gentlemen, demonstr ates that the Commission is resol ved to taken the views of Parliament into account
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first ly to thank Mr Pro c ac ci for his report
However, I should also like to extend than ks to the various comm itt ees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER + initiative
This initiative should give the country side new im pe t us to develop and t est new and o ri gin al ide as , ide as which it is then intend ed should at a l ater stage be incorpor ated in the general programmes as mod els
I am also pleased that Parliament ess enti ally support s the Commission' s view that LEADER + should be appli ed in all rural areas, that over ri d ing prior ities should be introdu ced and that, above all, active cooperation and net work ing between rural areas should be encoura ged
In addition , I note that Parliament sh a res the Commission' s view that the pre fer red form for implementing LEADER + is the use of global grant s
Tur ning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the w id est possible partnership and participation in LEADER +
The various group s, be they environmental organ is ations or groups concerned with employment , have the possibility of taking part in dra f ting the Commission dire ctives
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either ; there will be more
I should also like to remind you that the idea of set ting up an obs erv atory is nothing new
There was also an obs erv atory under LEADER I and LEADER II
It has one purp ose only and that is precisely to maintain active net work ing between the individual LEADER groups
The cost of this obs erv atory is not per mitted to ex ceed 2 % of the LEADER budget
As far as the possibility of having projects contain ing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integr ated into the new rural development policy, which mean s, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER
I now come to the cont ent of the report
In point 1 4 , Parliament call s on the Commission to sub mit an e val u ation report on LEADER II immedi ately
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because , as you know , it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 200 1 - for LEADER II funds to be dis b urs ed
We therefore think that it would be more sen sible to w a it until the programme ' s conclusion before carry ing out the e val u ation
We will obvious ly do this and will also forward a report to you on it
In point 1 8 , Parliament suggest s p ub lish ing a comp end ium of examp les of successful initiatives
In response I can only say that this already ex ists
It has already been comp il ed by the Commission and I can make a c op y available to any Member of this House who is interest ed
In point 2 1 , Parliament stress es that the guidelines in LEADER + now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start
I can only fully share your concern
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER + will again be presented to the S T A R Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provision al agreement which they g ave on 1 4 No ve mber
I ass u me that the Commission will then be able to adopt the defin i tive ver sion of the guidelines in Mar ch or A pri l
And as soon as these are p ub lish ed in the O ffic ial J our n al the remain ing months - in fact six months - can be used to sub mit LEADER + programmes
I believe that it is important to point out one thing : exp end it ure effect ed under LEADER + is elig ible from the time that the Commission programme start s run ning
For all programmes sub mitted before 3 0 A pri l of this year it will be possible to back d ate the begin ning of the period of elig ibility to 1 J an u ary
Finally, under point 2 0 the motion for a resolution contain s se ven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines
Ha ving given them th or ough consider ation, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraph s 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 are accept able to the Commission and are adopted
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be part ly ac cep ted because it re a ff ir ms that the time allow ed for appro ving programmes under LEADER + is a m ax imum of 5 months
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has , in our view, been over t ak en by event s because , following consult ations with the representatives of the Member States in the S T A R Committee , this point has already been re w ord ed al ong the l ines proposed by Parliament
That therefore le a ves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3 . The Commission can only end or se this request because of course it cor res pon d s precisely to what the Commission itself had o ri gin ally proposed
I must add , however, that cooperation between our action groups and sim ilar groups in third countries w ent too far for the Member States
An amendment was therefore made in the committee , but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the rev ised ver sion and t able the guidelines in that form
It will also continue to fight for Member States ' accept ance of this
I will comment brief ly on the 1 3 amendments tabled
H ere there are only three which the Commission cannot accept , Amend ments N os 3 , 12 and 1 3 . It can accept all of the others either in full or in ess ence
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an excep tion ally for t un ate circ um st ance that we are deb ating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time
R ec ent ly, because of political develop ments in Austri a, there is grow ing une ase within Europe. P o li tical demonstr ations are taking place as well as political dialogue
It is worth stress ing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies
We need specific proposal s, both for legislation and for action programmes as soci ated with the fight against discri mination and the form ation of free and fa ir soci e ties
So I will make brief mention of the p ack age against discri mination and take this opportunity to ask the compe t ent parliament ary comm itt ees to app oint their rapporteur s so that we can move a he ad with the anti - d is c ri mination p ack age as soon as possible
I now come to the EQUAL initiative , which is, of course, based on Article 1 3
The EQUAL initiative rel ates to all for ms of discri mination within the mean ing of Article 1 3 , namely the fight against discri mination based on ra ce , g end er, a ge , and special needs
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs St en z el , because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has pro ved excep tion ally difficult and comple x , both because some of the comm itt ees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sen si tive political issue
The first comment , which has been made by many others too , is whether women should be mentioned s ep ar ately
I agree that Article 1 3 contain s something we have expressed our dis ag ree ment about , but that is how the Treaty stand s right now and among the c ateg or ies of ty p es of discri min ation, discri mination on the ground s of g ender hold s equal place
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stand s today, the EQUAL initiative is structure d in that way
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special a x is for the employment strategy which rel ates to women and that a special programme is being prepared , the f if th programme for equ ality between m en and women
I have cl as si f ied the issues raised by the hon oura ble Members into four groups
Firstly, the enlargement of the them atic areas
As in employment strateg y, there are four them atic areas : employ ability , ent re pr ene urs hip , ad ap t ability and equal opportun ities, and we agree that those them atic areas should be enl ar ged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentr ate all the funds on one of the c ateg or ies su ffer ing discri min ation, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must sub mit one them atic c ateg ory for each group that is su ffer ing discri mination
The second subject is flex ibility and simp li fication
I agree with Mr Le in en that the word ing of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand
That is why the services are already tr ying to rev ise the text , simp li f y its structure and make its word ing e a si er to gr as p
As regards the subject of flex ibility , we propose development partnership s and cooperation both at the g e o graph ical level where different kind s of groups would cooper ate in a specific g e o graph ical area to combat discri mination in the work p la ce , and at the them atic level where , for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector
This would allow Member States great flex ibility to t ail or development cooperation to their own particular needs
Of course, a pr ere qu is ite for that is cooperation between the Member States, and a net work which will assist the exchange of experience
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance
We are tr ying to ar r ange that there will be four c ateg or ies for which funding is available . First , funding for prepar ation ; second , implementation ; third , m ut ual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience , and four th , technical assistance
S ince there has been great involve ment and concern about how technical assistance is to be provid ed, we must say that ex tern al offic es will be used
As Mr B arn i er too point ed out , it is imp os sible for all the work previous ly done by ex tern al co ll ab or at ors to be done now by the Commission' s sta ff
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by t end er, with a full des c ri p tion of the project for which ex tern al assistance is to be request ed. We would expect from each technical offic e a full des c ri p tion of the product so that the work can be mon it ore d and app ra ised
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible , both for reason s of political tim ing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as plan n ed, in other words, we must be absolutely read y by the end of 2000
Thank you, Commissioner
I shall con ve y your wish that the rapporteur s should be quickly app oint ed for the f il es you mentioned to my colleagues in the B ureau and to the appropriate comm itt ees
The debate is cl osed
The vote will take place tomorrow at no on
( T he sitting was cl osed at 8 . 4 0 p . m. )
A pp ro val of the Min utes of the two previous sitting s
The Min utes of the sitting s of Th urs day 3 F e b ru ary and Mon day 1 4 F e b ru ary have been dist rib ut ed
The Min utes of 3 F e b ru ary were o ri gin ally dist rib ut ed in Brus sels so perhaps this is why some Members did not rece ive them
A re there any comments ?
( T he Min utes were approved )
Madam President, my ha b it is always to be here for the open ing of the part -s ession on Mon day after n o ons at 5 . 00 p . m
Y esterday it was imp os sible for myself and many M E P s to be here , because the 2 . 1 5 p . m. A ir France f light , which n orm ally b r ings us here , was can cell ed, with no expl an ation from the a ir line , and we therefore ar ri ved very l ate
If A ir France ins ists on bo y c ot ting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occ urr ing again
Thank you, Mr M ed in a O r t eg a
I too whole h ear ted ly regret this situation
W ould you be so kind as to wr ite to me so that I have pro o f with which to t ack le the compe t ent authorities of both A ir France and the French Government ?
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore prot est most strong ly
Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr M ed in a O r t eg a yesterday
I feel that the French authorities - which have the hon our of h ous ing the European Parliament in St r as bour g - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure ad equ ate conn ec tions with all the capital s of the Union
A b s olute ly, Mr N ap ol it an o . Thank you
Madam President, off the subject of a er op l an e delay s, I wish to ap olog ise for the abs ence yesterday of my colleag ue in the Group of the G re ens / E uro pe an F ree All i ance, C ar ol ine L uc as , who is a B ri tis h Member
S he could not be here because she was ar re st ed yesterday mor ning during an anti - n uclear demonst ration in G l as g ow
Al though her i den tit y was not ed and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very app ar ent, she was still held in c ust od y all day
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to cont act the B ri tis h authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs L uc as recei ves an ap olog y. I have wr itt en to you in this respect together with my colleag ue , Mrs Ha ut al a
Thank you, Mr L ann o y e
I have received your let ter and have already cont act ed the B ri tis h P erman ent Rep resent ative
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today ' s vote which I st ar ted to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be post pon ed because we need a b it more time to negoti ate an important point
I am op tim istic and quite re la x ed and confid ent about the vote ; we shall g ain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL
We just need a b it more time to work out the detail s on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be post pon ed from this mor ning
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr L ann o y e made : Mrs L uc as was ar re st ed just outside G l as g ow for prot es ting against the T ri d ent b ase at F as l an e
I have a lot of sy mp ath y with that prot est
I have , however, no sy mp ath y for Mrs L uc as tr ying to h ide behind her Parliament ary imm unity
I have also been ar re st ed for prot es ting at F as l an e
I did not h ide behind any imm unity
I to ok the p un ish ment that ca me to me
Mrs L uc as should do the same
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs St en z el has made to post p one the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very live ly debate in committee , and, given that it is a major Commission proposal , which ref ers to the agreements we reached last year , I consider it ad m is sible
We agree with Mrs St en z el that the request to post p one the vote is ad m is sible in the interests of achie ving the gre ates t possible agreement between the group s, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broad est majority possible
Do es any one want to speak against Mrs St en z el ' s request , as support ed by Mrs G h il ard ot ti ?
If not, then we will proceed to the vote
( P ar liament approved the request )
Madam President, under R ule 2 9 ( 4 ) you should be k ep t inform ed by political groups of any Members who have j o ined a new political group or who have left a political group
Ha ve you received any no ti fication of any Members le a ving the Group of the European Pe ople 's Party or does the Austrian Pe ople 's Party continue to sit in that political group ?
Mr C or b et t , I have not received any no ti fication
Madam President, I am am a zed at Mr C or b et t ' s re action
He should find other way s of ra ising his prof ile than express ing views on such matters here
We are solid ly with our Austrian f ri end s who have pro ven to be good European s in the past
They have our full support
(A pp la use )
Ag enda
With regard to the agenda for Th urs day , following a request made yesterday in pl en ary , I propose ext ending the debate on top ical and urg ent subject s of major importance by h alf an h our to 6 . 00 p . m. when the vote will take place
( P ar liament g ave its ass ent )
Commission' s strategic objectives and legislative programme
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission state ments on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the ann ual legislative programme for 2000
I therefore immedi ately give the f lo or to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five - y ear programme is an extremely important undert aking , and this is why I pre fer red that you be given the un ab ri d ged text of the speech , which is available in four l ang u ag es
To respect my spe aking time, I will conf ine myself to refer ring only to the broad out l ines of my programme : a programme for the d a wn ing of a new legisl at ure and a new cent ur y, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broad er pers pe ctive , a Europe which is currently in a par ad o x ical situation
Let us re me mber that for h alf a cent ur y, Europe has provided us with peace , security and freedom and a un ited Europe has also contrib ut ed to gi ving us a period of un p re ced ent ed pro s per ity
We are now see ing the begin ning of a strong rec over y, which it appe ar s may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are pr ud ent with our polic ies. This rec over y is the l og ical consequ ence of the efforts we have made , but it comes at a pr ice : it follow s the rest ruct uring of public account s in European countries, which have k ep t inf l ation under control with a policy w ise ly intend ed to control costs and increase produ c tiv ity in a Europe that has be g un a v ig or ous rest ruct uring of its own industri es, ban ks and public servic es, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go
N ever thel ess, despite these aspect s, European citizens are dis app oint ed and concerned : by unemployment which is not fall ing quickly enough ; by a Europe tra il ing behind in techn olog y, and seem ing ly fall ing even further behind , and in particular a scientific sector which is st ar ting to l ag a long way behind too ; by the European institutions which appe ar dist ant and do not seem to be in step with the tim es, st ar ting with the Commission itself
The crisis in the Commission was , in fact, a crucial point in the relations hip between Europe and its citizen s, and the low turn out at the European ele ctions was a wor ry ing indic ation of this
E ven strong er still , however, is the sense of in sec urity , the feel ing of being un p re p ared in a new world that is mo ving forward s, a world which is completely chang ing, where global isation will even end up chang ing our points of reference
This is not the first time this has happen ed : Europe was once conf ron ted with a sim ilar trans f orm ation, an exp lo sion of its market s, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world
I am refer ring to the si xt e ent h cent ur y when the disc over y of Am er ic a turn ed every thing up side down
S ome countries - such as France and S p ain - man aged to meet the challenge , gi ving r ise to great n ation States ; other countries - such as It aly - did not meet this challenge and lo st all the he ad way that they had acc um ul ated during the first part of that m ill en n ium : he ad way in sci ence, techn olog y, economic prog res s, def ence struct ures and m il it ary organ is ation, ph il os oph y and l iter at ure
T od ay , Europe is fa cing a sim ilar challenge , and we know that, just as hist ory has been un for g i ving in the past , it will not be for g i ving in the present
In this context of wh ol es al e change , and in order to prevent our n ation States v anish ing again , in the w ake of global isation which is creating h ither t o un p re ced ent ed sc al es and chall eng es, Europe needs to be economic ally strong , because global isation demand s un ity , because every day we hear new s of new agreements at world level and new s of changes at European level too
But more v ital still is a Europe that feel s strong in the political ar en a
In years past , the single market and the single currency have been the p iv ot al point of our action s, the main st ay of European life
T od ay , the new f ron ti ers of European integration are political f ron ti ers : common fore ign and security policy, justice and internal security , and - to a less er extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our co e x ist ence is based
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000 - 2 00 5 , a programme that was immedi ately s ent to the European Parliament and with which you are already fam ili ar , so I will not go into detail about it now
S ome of you may find it lack s detail , but no political structure set s out detail ed five - y ear programmes
This is the European Union, not the So v i et Union
Our programme high light s the major points of refer ence, the major areas for action : first ly, the development of new for ms of govern ance for Europe ; second ly, ext ension and enlargement of the area of peace , freedom, and security ; third ly, the la un ch of a new stage in the grow th of the economy ; four th ly, saf eg uard ing and impro ving quality of life
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years
With regard to the first area - new for ms of govern ance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undert ak en to produ ce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since , in the light of major issues which are chang ing the structure of the way we inter act , the Commission is first of all prepar ing for a debate ; we will sub sequ ently discuss the cont ent with you ; this will give r ise to a policy document , and fin ally, a legislative document
This is an effective , transpar ent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe
This White Paper is a response to the chall eng es that enlargement is for cing on us, an enlargement that is for cing us to re th ink the work ings of all our institution s, re th ink our very policies - all our policies - and above all re th ink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 2 5 or 3 0 , and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level , at regional level and at local government level
But it is not only enlargement that is urg ing us towards this re th ink : as I said a few mom ents ag o, it is also economic and political global isation itself
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more effic ient , to bring us clos er to the citizens and to encoura ge everyone to get invol v ed, st ar ting with the important issue of the involve ment of women
One of the main differ ences in the comp ar is on made rec ently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mo bility or risk capital , as women ' s involve ment in economic life , an issue that has much more pro min ence in the United States than in Europe
This is a field where Europe has , never thel ess, always been in the v ang uard . We therefore need to ref lect on this at l ength and with an open mind , and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own r ol es and their own policies
We shall therefore get st ra ight back to work on this White P ap er, although in order to fin ish it, we shall have to w a it for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference , and it will therefore not be read y until sp ring 200 1
It will not be a ph il os oph ical P ap er, but a practical P ap er, full of focus ed proposals
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total re th ink , and we shall therefore do two things : we are , and will continue to be , fully comm itted to internal reform , and we shall re th ink our policies in detail
I have asked all the Commission ers - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analy tical way - to p in p oint all the activities that we can for go
The Commission must def ine what its fundamental activities are , what it must concentr ate on and sh ed its non- ess ential activ ities, there b y free ing up new resources and ens uring a more correct and co - oper ative relations hip with individual countries, regions and local commun ities
So we shall be free ing up new resour ces, but - I fear , and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already free ing up will , in turn , be ins u fficient in terms of allow ing us to address our new tas ks : I am think ing of enlargement , the new sector of justice and home affair s, health issues and environmental matters
When that time com es, when we have used up all our resour ces, I shall not h es it ate to come here before you to request further resour ces, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resour ces, we shall have to ref use to take on any new d u ties because the available resources will not be comm ens ur ate with the new tas ks that we will be taking on
As for internal reform , you well know how comm itted my Commission has been to this since day one
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undert ake v ig or ous and compreh ensive internal reform , if it does not become more effic ient , if it does not increase efficiency in all sector s, st ar ting with the sector in which the wor st back lo g s have bu il t up in the past - ex tern al aid
Pro vid ing aid r ap id ly, when it is need ed, sa ves human li ves ; in many cases provid ing it l ate is wor se than not provid ing it at all
When I speak about ex tern al aid , my thought s immedi ately turn to the B alk an s. There is cause for hope than ks to the commitment of our work ers on the ground , an ext ra ordin ary commitment given our organ is ational problems
My thought s also turn to B ern ard K ou ch ner ' s effort s, of the st ability p act that we all v ig or ous ly support with total d ed ic ation, but I also think of new event s, such as C ro a ti a, where the situation has chang ed in a few wee ks : the European institutions immedi ately open ed the way to dialogue with this country and received the new s know ing full well that the only way to resol ve not only B os n ia ' s problem s, but more particularly S er b ia ' s problems is to th row a c ur tain of democracy a round S er b ia
This is the new e lement that we must help to bring to the B alk ans
We must increase our efficiency in this area . We must re op en the D an ub e to bo at s
It is contra d ict ory to offer aid to R om an ia and B ul g ar ia yet le ave these countries un able to h ar ness their gre ates t resour ce
We must dec on t am in ate the r i ver and, in view of this, over the next few day s the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be put ting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem
We have done a lot in the B alk ans : the new European R ec on struction Ag ency for Kosovo , the B alk ans T as k For ce and new regulations to spe ed up proced ures
N ever thel ess, we defin ite ly have to do more
We must li beral ise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union ; we must contrib ute to build ing inf ra st ructural link s that will end its cent ur ies -o ld is ol ation ; we must int en si f y efforts to build a democratic , pl ural ist soci ety in these countries with institution s, public structure s, polic e for ces and a structure d civil soci et y, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a un ited region , as regards both politic s and the economy
If we do not do this, we shall have fail ed in our d ut y
R e me mber that the Mar s h all P l an was not effective simply because of the sc al e of its resources : it was even more effective because it made us European s work together towards a new h or i z on ; it g ave us a f res h out lo ok in terms of our politic s and our economy
This is what we need to do for the B alk ans
Europe must pro ve - in the B alk ans and the rest of the world - its ab ility to extend the area of security , peace and freedom and its ab ility to take a lead ing role on the international stage
We are clear ly, once again , ret ur ning to enlargement , which must be put into practice in t and em with the ext ension of the area of security , peace and freedom
We have made many prom ises in this regard , but I believe we shall suc ceed in keep ing our prom ises even though we have a very de lic ate p ath to t read
Inde ed, enlargement , which will be with us for our five years in offic e and be y ond - I am refer ring to the as p ir ations of applic ant countries - must h ing e on conc re te , objective criteri a, and also on reas s uring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater de g ree , public opinion in our own Member States
There will be f ri end s hip , c al m , open ness but also a certain str ict ness in the enlargement process
I repe at : we must reas s ure public opinion in those countries that wish to j o in but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reas s ur ance
Our respon sib ili ties do not st op at enlargement , or at the B alk ans
There are certain other key issues : relations with U k ra ine , relations with R us si a, relations with ne igh bour ing countries and more important ly, the important question of relations with the s ou ther n M ed iter r an e an which will be a crucial point for European hist or y, and for security and peace in Europe for future gener ations
In this regard , we have a responsibility towards the whole of A f ric a
In recent tim es, A f ric a has raised h op es and has received off ers of help , but nothing t ang ible has yet been achie ved. In recent years in A f ric a, we have not seen a sh i ft from total it ar ian reg im es to democracy , but quite the cont r ary - a sh i ft from democracy to total it ar ian reg im es
A f ric a is, for us, a wor ry ing top ic for discussion . We therefore have another d ut y at international level , which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade : the undert aking to re la un ch the M ill en n ium R ound and to take on some fundamental problems aff ec ting the po ore st countries, not just in terms of w ri ting off deb t s, but also v ia the un il ater al open ing - up to trade with the po ore st countries in the world , with a great deal of will ing ness on our part , which we had already proposed prior to S e at t le but which we could not put into practice
We need to provide al tern ative answer s, other wise e p is od es such as those seen in S e at t le will be repe ated over and over and will come to ha mp er one of Europe ' s positive r ol es in hist ory
All over the world , Europe ' s actions must be guid ed by a de ep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individual s and min or ities
We should re me mber that we , the European Union, are a un ion of min or ities : we are all a min ority within Europe
There are concerns even within the F i ft een , concerns which may even sur f ace again in the next dec ade
I am refer ring to the situation in Austri a, where the Commission has remain ed true to its role , being d ut y -b ound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the un w a ver ing gu ard ian of the Trea ti es, read y to p un ish every min or b re ach of the principles of democracy , law and respect for min or ities
S ome people have critic ised me over the congratul atory m ess age I s ent to Ch ance ll or Sch ü s sel
My m ess age to you is : do not take the necessary and proper cour t es ies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the cont ent
R ere ad the let ter : The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere co in cid ence - from Article 6 of the Treat y, I repe at , Article 6 of the Treaty
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European he ad of government has ever been remind ed of these principles by the Commission when they were elect ed
This is what we wish to do : maintain our role as a sup r an ational structure , maintain the role con fer red on us by the Trea ti es, but also be un w a ver ing on principles and make jud ge ments based on fact s
L ast No ve mber , the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti - rac ism directive
I would ask the Council to adopt it s w i ft ly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bas es of our social cohesion
I will quickly conclud e by mention ing the last two points of our programme : the economy and quality of life
I have already talk ed about the economy : we well know which basic in g re di ents will set Europe on the p ath towards a l as ting rec over y which will in turn create more jobs
We must continue to keep inf l ation under control , proceed with li beral is ation, ensure more competition , encoura ge the dis se mination of information techn olog y and all new techn olog ies ; p us h forward with sci ence, and p us h back scientific b ound ar ies, and develop an appe tit e for being at the c ut ting e d ge of sci ence
The forth coming L is b on S um mit on these issues - dis se mination of techn olog y, employment - will be a dec is ive su m mit
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a su m mit of this kind
We are at last hold ing it and cannot let this opportunity s li p through our f ing ers
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life
We have open ed this ch ap ter with the White Paper on F o od S a f ety : we now need to make significant he ad way in the environment sector
The E ri k a oil s lic k and the cont am in ation of the D an ub e demonstr ates the press ing need for European sc al e inter vention to saf eg uard the environment
The time has come to discus s, and then establish , a bod y for em erg ency civil protection in Europe
All too often we find ourselves call ing for this after a disaster has occ ur red
I think it would be appropriate to begin think ing about these things before disast ers happen
These are the chall eng es that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are fa cing
How will we jud ge , ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our m and ate ?
How are we going to assess the results of these five years ?
I do not know , but one b ench mark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together
Let us take a very simp le par am et er : turn out at the next European ele ctions
If it is high er than at the previous ele ction s, it will mean that we have successful ly m et our challenge
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are fa ced with all these major political chall eng es, but precisely because of the rec over y that is now under way , we are also fa ced with major opportunities
This , ladies and gentlemen, could be the dec ade of Europe
Inde ed, I would say that this must be the dec ade of Europe
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Party ( C h ris ti an Dem ocrat s ) and European Dem ocrat s wel com es this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission sub mitted a document so that we could prep are for the debate
We also welcome the conclusion s which we find in this document
And we welcome the broad out l ines of the speech which President Prodi has just given
We read in the conclusion s in the document that the five - y ear term of offic e of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes
Europe will press a he ad with integration ; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will , in the end , re un ite our contin ent
A demand ing, amb iti ou s, perhaps even prop he tic task and we wish you every suc ces s, Mr President of the Commission
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to sh a pe the future if we pro ve our worth in the present
I say that in all ear n est ness and I have ch os en my words careful ly
I refer to the current debate on the present conf lic ts in the European Union
We in the European Union are one Community
We be l ong together , even when there are problems
N ow is not the time to is ol ate but to un ite and to complete together the task of un if ying Europe
Mr President of the Commission, you have represent ed and def end ed the European Parliament time and again over recent wee ks
You have seen your self as the gu ard ian of the Trea ti es, and that is indeed your role
For that and for the let ter to the F eder al Ch ance ll or of the Rep ublic of Austria which you mention ed, we express ly respect , ac know ledge and support you
(A pp la use )
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same : we want a strong Europe in the tw ent y -f irst cent ur y, a democratic Europe which is able to act
A Europe which def end s its values of human di gn ity and democratic r ule of law both intern ally and to the outside world and, at the same time, look s after its global interests with di gn ity , pa ti ence and conv in cing s el f- con f id ence
Europe ' s m ess age , the European Union' s m ess age to the world should not be one of ar ro g ance or even European national ism, no ; it must be one of cooper ation, partnership and peace ful development
G lo bal isation gi ves us the ch ance to sh a pe the world , which is bec om ing small er and small er, as a world of peace ful competition and solidarity
S een in this light , global isation is more of an opportunity than a dang er, more of a coming together than a s eg reg ation, more m ut ual en r ich ment than s ep ar ation
But we also know that we can only sh a pe the h uge challenge of global isation together as European s
G lo bal isation is not only an economic proces s, it is also a cultural proces s, which is why we say : we want partnership in the world , we do not want the cl as h of civil is ations which many are pre dic ting , we want partnership , a meeting , exchange and peace
But we also say : we want to def end this European Community of to ler ance, which is why a common fore ign , security and def ence policy is so important
N e goti ations with six central European countries are st ar ting today, bring ing the European fam ily a step clos er together
We agree with what you said about the B ar ce l on a process. All the countries in the M ed iter r an e an area must ac know ledge human di gn ity , democracy and the r ule of law
For us, the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Party and the European Dem ocrat s, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years ; it is also important that we dec la re our fa ith in the single European currency and use the policy of st ability as a basis for con so lid ating the European currency in coming years
We therefore take the un com p rom ising view that we must maintain a res olute and cons ist ent st ability p act
We need structural reform s in the European economy
M ost important ly, we need to rest ore a European economy in which perf orm ance pay s and people can work as ent re pr ene urs
It would be Europe ' s u nd o ing if we were to end up with just a few mul tin ational s and no future for small and medium -si zed business es in Europe
(A pp la use ) The Commission has an important role to play here by get ting a coordin ated policy under way with the n ation states to redu ce tax es so that ent re pr ene urs hip pay s
We too want to help put Europe on its fe et
You sp o ke in your p aper of dec entral isation and subsidiarity
We support that
The n ations, regions, to wn s and commun ities of Europe will be pres er ved
However, there is a current tr end - the " f a un a, f l or a, ha b it at " directive was qu oted as an example - which, in my country at least , cre ates the imp ression that as soci ations are by p ass ing national and regional institutions and sub mit ting programmes to Brus sels and that Brus sels is then making decisions aff ec ting the proper ty of count less agric ult ural hold ings in the countries of the European Union
I mere ly mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we tr y to achieve more legal security in the future
Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words : as the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Party and the European Dem ocrat s, we have every interest in a strong Commission
If you are pers u a sive in your action s, we all re ap the benefit s
In this respect we wish you every suc ces s. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s w at ch d og
If we have the m er est su sp ic ion that you are fail ing to saf eg uard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for comp l ain t - on the cont r ary we ac know ledge that this is not the case - , but if European law is inf ring ed then we shall fight any such inf ring e ment un com p rom ising ly, precisely because peace in the European Union is found ed on this law
We must pres erve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peace m ak ers in the world
(A pp la use )
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the present ation of , and the first ever debate on , the Commission' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so f ond of ; as I am - for the whole legisl at ure
Firstly, this is welcome because it explain s, to our fe llow citizen s, what we are intend ing to do and what we are already do ing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and tr y to improve on it for the future
We have taken al most ele ven months - President Prodi was n om in ated at the B er lin S um mit in Mar ch last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entire ly President Prodi ' s fa ult
We are rec over ing from a crisis . However, I believe that, in the future , it would be appropriate for the inves tit ure of the next Commission to co in ci de with the present ation of a legislative programme
We are b re aking new ground and doing so in comple x circ um stan ces
President Prodi be gan his speech by talking of a par ad o x ical situ ation, a par ad o x in the European Union and also throughout the world : we are at the d a wn of a new sec ular m ill en n ium , d om in ated by the we b of the Intern et and the s or c er y of b i ot echn ological adv ance, and we are living through a g en u ine change of e p o ch . However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and govern ance - a word which, at least in S p anish , b r ings to mind the previous na me of the Min ist ry of Intern al Affair s, although it may be an appropriate word any way - , the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government , and, since President Prodi always def end s his home to wn , B olog n a, I would adv ise him to go to S i en a for a while and see something which we all understand : the f res c os of Am b ro g i o L or en z et ti , which speak of b on govern o [ go od government ] and m al govern o [ b ad government ]
What we need here is good government , Madam President
S ince we are rec over ing from a very comple x crisis , we must tr y to en h ance our institutions and give them sub st ance
I would like to remind the House of something which we often for get , and that is that the inves tit ure of the Prodi Commission, last S ep t ember , received w ide support . In our opinion, this demonstr ates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe
I would like to point out that, within this broad cons ens u s, there were some Group s which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opp o sition to the majority of the Council
It is precisely this which, in a sense , is h in der ing the important process of develop ing cod ec ision within the legislative programme
I am po in ting this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continu ity in the work carried out throughout the legisl at ure
On the other hand, we are w it ness ing the b ir th of a political Europe, which ent ail s a colle ction of sh ared values which we all agree upon , and a European Union at the service of the citizens
With regard to the event s of recent day s, I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day , and the week , that the Intergovernmental Conference is st ar ting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphas is upon the ch arter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis , I believe should be fully included in the Trea ties
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point
In this regard , Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and w at ch our l ang u age
L ast week , the new Minister for Fin ance of the Austrian co al ition des c rib ed the Austrian Parliament as a far ce and a the at re
Th ose of us who have had to live under a d ict at ors hip know of the exist ence of d ict at ors hip s with card b o ard governments
There can be no democracy without a living parliament
I believe that this type of l ang u age is extremely dangerous and I would like to con d em n it here and now
With regard to the four great prior ities which President Prodi system atic ally ref ers to and with regard to his analysis of the chall eng es fa cing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement
N ever thel ess, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Social ist Group is concerned, there has been a change of prior ities
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda , which also includ es what is know n as ' qu ality of life ' prior ities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consum ers and as people , in relation to those questions which we always talk about , but never give su fficient priority to , that is, the European social mod el and its ad ap t ation to the new circ um stan ces, consum er right s, respect for the environment and sustainable development
When spe aking of the commitment to full employment , we have to bear in mind that, these day s, full employment does not mean what it me ant in the e ra of B ever id ge at the end of the Second W or ld W ar , that is to say, employment for the m al e he ad of the h ouse ho ld
We must ar g ue for equ ality of the se x es, the fam ous ' g ender main st ream ing ' , which is one of the least develop ed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme
This means prior iti s ing se x equ ality , the ad ap t ation of the social mod el and, above all, an une qu iv oc al fight against popul ism when ever our economic and social cohesion is under threat
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission
It must be comp lement ed with a forth ri ght fight against r ac ism and int ol er ance so that we may come to recogn ise , in practice , the e v olution of a Union which has become a m ag n et for the rest of the world and an immig ration z one , given its pro s per ity and se as on al dem o graph ic s
I believe that this is the first objective for us to purs ue
In this respect I would also add another e lement , which is economic government , given the single currency , and I believe this is in es c ap able
This is another question on which the Commission must make progress
With regard to the amb iti ous objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adop ting this broad ening of the process of negoti ation and integr ation, I would like - and my Group would like - more cl ar ific ation in relation to the re vision of Ag enda 2000
Do es the Commission think that there will be never be any re vision ?
The issue of tax ation also seems to us to be absolutely essential
With regard to govern ance in general , I believe it might be worth think ing in the ore tical terms
I would like to remind you of one thing : it is dangerous to re th ink the entire govern ance of the European Union from here
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity
If we are cap able of def ining what our area of govern ance is, I think that would be very positive
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also rele vant to this discussion
N ot only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states , our parliament s and our civil soci ety
Madam President, I would like to refer brief ly to the last objective , which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental : the st ab il isation of the contin ent and the strengthen ing of the Europe ' s role in the world
It appe ar s that there is agreement and support with regard to the prior iti s ation of S ou th - E ast Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthen ing of the Euro - M ed iter r an e an programme and our ab ility to prevent conf lic t s, as well as an issue which we se ld om talk about ; the N orth - S ou th challenge
We must not for get A f ric a, a contin ent which has been for s ak en, not only by G od , but also by Europe, n or our important contribution to cooper ating with development
L ast ly, an issue for which we are increasing ly responsible , as the world ' s fore most economic and comm er cial power , that is, Europe ' s v o ice in the world , which does not simply mean adop ting an active approach to the M ill en n ium R ound
It means the reform of the United N ations and the international financial institution s, for which Europe has an en orm ous responsibility
A b ove all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in pl ain l ang u age , clear ly, by chang ing to some extent the j ar g on which we use , because we cannot ask the European s, who are living through prof ound chang es, to take part and show en th u si as m towards us if we continue to use a form of l ang u age which they find completely in ac ces sible
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in u s. I hope this will be demonstr ated when we hold the next European ele ctions
Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of dep art ure , the c ore of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today : that is that the st akes now are ir re f ut ably political
They are political because we are mo ving on
E ven though we have not yet fin ish ed con stru c ting all the economic build ing b l ock s, we are mo ving on from that kind of function al ist build ing of Europe to a much more chall eng ing political pers pe ctive
The challenge of enlargement is political
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affair s, of deal ing with asylum and immig ration and crime , is very political
The challenge of a common fore ign security and def ence policy is very political
B ec ause it is political it is more comple x . B ec ause it is political it is more so ver e ign ty -s en si tive
B ec ause it is more so ver e ign ty -s en si tive it is more v ot er - and citizen -s en si tive
We need , therefore, to find a way forward towards these political end s and objectives , to add res s, not mere ly the s cep tic ism but the gre ates t en em y, the ap ath y which you i d enti f y
The means of achie ving this are difficult but they are real
I app la ud your view that we need more sy n erg y between our institution s, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to u nd ers c ore the extent of the political challenge
We need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil soci ety
We need more expl an ation of what Europe is about
We need to be able to conf ron t fear s and an x ie ti es, because in many in stan ces the gre ates t fear is fear itself
P er haps with more dialogue and expl an ation we can over come some of that
My group is especially att ra ct ed to the cre ative pos sib ili ties you sign al in regard to the pro s pect of a White Paper next sp ring address ing the issue of govern ance
As we look at the Europe of net work ing which you des c rib e, it is very important that Europe concentr ates on its c ore bus ines s, that we have the c oura ge to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back
That could conv ince people that Europe, in its govern ance, is not something run exc lu sive ly from Brus sel s, which concentr ates and so ak s up more power s, more decision s, more authority
That is the political c ore of the challenge and I think you have i d enti f ied it well before this House today
For my group , enlargement is the first priority against which all the other pos sib ili ties for reform must be measure d , be they govern ance, be they the inter governmental con ference , be they reform of the institutions
We see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of " th em and us "
We see enlargement as a positive su m g ain for member and c and id ate states
I suggest to the Commission, as a rep os it ory of an en orm ous amount of detail ed information on enlargement , to present a document , that explain s the value of enlargement , not just in budget ary and financial terms but in a broad er sense ; a document , like the C ec ch in i report before the S ingle A ct , that explain s to people in a way which en g ag es them in the debate that this is the g rand , hist or ic challenge fa cing Europe today
We need to be able to prep are that ground careful ly
On s ou th - e ast ern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achieve ments
In the life ti me of this Commission and this Parliament we must suc ceed in the task of w in ning the difficult and une as y peace in s ou th - e ast ern Europe
We app la ud the st ab il isation and as soci ation agreement s, but we would like to see more
We will p ub lish this materi al and bring it forward in the debate on the S w ob od a report l ater this week
The strategic p aper emphas ises the global role of the European Union
Our central aim must be to give the Union a we ight in global affair s comm ens ur ate with its we ight in terms of aid , trade and fin ance
At the begin ning of this dec ade we must fore se e how our institutions will develop intern ation ally by its end , and not ably where we f it into international mon etary bod ies, where we f it into U N ag en ci es and so on
We need to open that debate
In conclusion , this mor ning , the day after St V al en tin e 's D ay , the new sp ap ers are saying that your h one y m o on period is over
I do not know whether you are a r om an tic or not, Mr Prodi
P er haps this is a very un rom an tic thing to say on such a mor ning
However, we in the Li beral Group welcome this because it means we are now set t ling down to business
That is the way it should be
Reg ard ing the many ad jec tiv al des c ri p tions of Europe you address ed in your speech - an en er ge tic Europe, an enter p ris ing Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inc lu sive - let me , in a word de ar to the hear t of my Li beral colleagues , give in one ad jec tive , one des c ri p tion of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for govern ance : an en abl ing Europe
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I great ly ad m ire the open ness with which you ad mit that the European Union must change fund ament ally
You g ave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politic s if we can t ack le the major issues al ong side the day - t o - day on es
At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortun ately, your programme remind s me in many way s of a party man if est o
There are a lot of good int en tions in it, but it very much lack s conc re te proposals concerning how this can all be achie ved
As in any other party man if est o, it is full of contra dic tions
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recogn ise them
First let me speak about the economy and social development
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordin ate the aim of competi tiveness with the aim of full employment ; that is what was mentioned in your programme
S h ould we at long last be dra f ting con ver g ence criteri a, in which - as you in fact h int at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be high er than , say, the three most successful countries in this matter ?
E c ological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of , because we can only create employment and sustainable development by chang ing our tax ation structure . But , unfortun ately, as we all know , this is an area where the European Union is tot ally un able to act
Do ple ase ra ise this issue at the inter governmental con ference
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focus es on tas ks that individual countries cannot att end to al one
In this respect , Parliament will defin ite ly def end , al ong with your selves , the importance of sup r an ational decision -m aking
One contra dic tion within your programme rel ates to global isation
I think it is very cre d it able that you should mention the con cept of ' g lo bal administration ' , as others too have said here
However, ple ase le arn from the event s of S e at t le : we have to be able to comb ine the freedom in world trade , on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to def end , on the other
You must em b ark on a dialogue with the international community
Do ple ase tr y to make the international organ is ations democratic
The European Union could be critic ally important in a process in which the United N ations and the W T O really do become subject to democratic monitoring
We can sub mit mo tions for this together with you
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil soci et y, although , unfortun ately, this is another contra dic tion
You o u ght to also be able to draw conclusion s at the IGC
We have to t able mo tions propos ing that our citizens might really have a direct imp act on decision -m aking
What you just said is absolutely true : people want more en g aged democracy
In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to g ain the appro val of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too
Madam President, my group was one of those which want ed to have a document allow ing an exchange of views on the Commission' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate , inst ead of being redu ced to an on - th e -s p ot re action in pl en ary
The main m er it of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it ex ists
We are also pleased to see certain state ments and int en tions which it contain s and which Mr Prodi has just under l ined and, in some cas es, use ful ly cl ar if ied
The current global isation process is - and I qu ote - ' e x c lu sive rather than inc lu sive and has w id en ed the in equ al ities ' . The European Union' s objective must therefore be to help def ine new ground rules within the Union and in international relations
C lear ly, many citizens are ' d is ench ant ed and an x ious ' about the lack of real and l as ting solution s to basic problem s, such as unemployment and social exc lusion , which affect our very exist ence . This must be one of our absolute prior ities
We do need to re th ink many aspect s of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a suc ces s. We also need ' d is tin ctive strategic partnership s ' with our ne igh bour s to the s ou th and e ast in order to achieve st ability and peace
There are pl ent y of areas for serious discussion
We will careful ly stud y the plan n ed White P ap ers and will particip ate con stru ctive ly in the work be g un or prom ised
It is in this spirit that I have three critic is ms to make . These must be taken into account if we are t ru ly to sh a pe the new Europe, as pro c la im ed amb iti ous ly by the t it le of the Commission document and Mr Prodi ' s speech and do so in reality not r h et or ic
The first and most serious critic ism concerns the Commission' s prop ens ity for rather g rand il o qu ent s el f- s a tis f action with regard to the European Union and for a c urs ory and even con d es c ending view of our partn ers. The perf ect i ll ust ration of this cri pp ling fla w li es in the open ing s ent ence of the Commission communication
This t al ks of the European Union as ' li ving pro o f that peace , st ability , freedom and pro s per ity can be brought to a contin ent ' and as a mod el show ing the world the way forward . It conclud es that ' our ne igh bour s have the ch ance to j o in this pro s per ity , and we have a go ld en opportunity to en able them to do so '
A more bal an ced and more r ig or ous di ag n os is would be welcome in my view
S im ilar ly, the idea that the e uro has fo ster ed a cons ens us on w age mod er ation is not really b or ne out by the repe ated n erv ous or d ers iss u ed by the European C entral B ank to the trade un ion s which are de em ed to be too demand ing
My second critic ism follow s on from the first
This extre me difficult y in see ing the contra dic tions of the current situation and, where necessary , conf ron ting these is serious ly li m iting the will , d u ly confirm ed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demand s
For example, at least in the countries which I know well , I doubt that the intention , repe ated three or four tim es in the Commission document , to reform ' E uro pe ' s social protection , health care and p ension system s . . . in a c li m ate of more c au ti ous public sp ending ' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we app ar ently want to w in back
My third critic ism st em s from the first two . The weak ness of the analysis and the ob st ac les to the necessary changes have result ed in a project whose scope is sever e ly limited by an over ab und ance of general isation s, a rather ind ec is ive approach and therefore a lack of im pe t us
But all is not lo st
This is a st ar ting point and we have five years to suc ce ed, provided that the political will ex ists and is expressed with su fficient force and cl arity
My group is fully int ent on help ing with this work
Madam President, reform ing and democra tis ing the institutions of the European Union are central to the hist or ic and mor al challenge of the enlargement process
This was the open ing statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years
We aw a it the White Paper on the govern ance of the European Union deal ing with the issue of bal ance between Member States ' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be p ub lish ed this su m m er
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision -m aking proced ures of the Commission
The Commission, in its proposals to the forth coming inter governmental con ference , has indic ated that its pre ference li es in see ing small er Member States l ose their a ut om atic right to n om in ate a member of the European Commission
This is a sc en ar i o where b y the European Union has a members hip of over 2 5 Member States
I do not want to see a two - ti er European Union bu il t
I believe this would f ly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of R ome and all sub sequ ent t rea ties
There must be equ ality in terms of national represent ation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions
I would like to remind those who seek to e li min ate the right of small Member States to n om in ate a European Commissioner that the United States of Am er ic a gi ves small er states the same recogn ition as l ar g er states in the United States S en ate
M ore or less each of the 5 0 states in the U S has two elect ed posi tions in the United States S en ate, regard less of its population
An y future reform s of the European Union t rea ties will require a refer end um to be held in my country
It would be very difficult for those who propose a ' y es ' vote in any such future treat y to w in the support of the I r ish people if we l ose our right to have our n om in ee to the European Commission
U nd ou b ted ly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the govern ance of the European Union which will be p ub lish ed this su m m er
On ce again there are special areas of policy -m aking which should be left to the d om ain of the national Member States
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introdu ction of qu al if ied majority voting on tax ation, justice and home affair s, and fore ign affair s at European Union level
At present , under Article 9 9 of the Treaty of R ome , decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by un an im ity
I believe that this proposal should remain , as a common European tax ation cod e would di min ish rather than en h ance the work ings of the European Union
I support the enlargement of the European Union
I support institution al changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a st ream l ined and structure d man ner
However, we must re me mber that the public opinion of 3 7 0 million people in the European Union is a v ital fact or in chang ing the EU t rea ties
Ch ang es should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too s w eep ing, other wise public opinion will make ra ti fication of any future European Union treat y very difficult indeed
Madam President, I am spe aking on behalf of the It al ian R ad ical Members
President of the Commission, a short while ag o you said that no political structure set s out five - y ear plans
This is true , if we think of R us si a ' s plans in the th ir ti es, but at the start of your m and ate, a few months ag o, you your self ann oun ced at the Conference of President s that you would , however, be pres en ting a legislative programme, or rather , the major policy l ines of the European government of which you are he ad and in the run ning of which we are en g aged today
So , whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the b re ak d own of the document you dist rib ut ed to us and of the acc om p an ying speech is not much more than a list of good intention s, or rather a list of issues on the t able. It does not, however, give us the imp ression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these point s, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s d ut y
In this House , in the past , large -s c al e deb ates have taken place on major strategic op tions which the Commission, under its power of initiative , la un ch ed, not as experi ment s, but as proposals which then made v ary ing de g re es of prog res s, but in any case did contrib ute to the integration and development of the European Union
In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of " T en Comm and ments " : a whole ra ft of issues are list ed, but if I may say so , we are left with the imp ression that the Commission is a f ra id to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points
There was only one point that you really stress ed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it look s al most as if the high est priority task that you are set ting your self is to c e ase " un n ecess ary " activities
We should be careful , though , Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and back ed this Commission - at least a parliament ary majority back ed this Commission - precisely because , first and fore most , the reform of the Commission would bring con so lid ation, a new i den tit y and a new aw ar en ess of being guid ed by a firm hand
Let us consider the sc en ar i o where b y the Commission, not belie ving itself to be equal to the task , wish es, or propos es to sh ed, for example, its po w ers to implement common polic ies, which it is never thel ess accord ed by the Treaty
What do we expect from a government in any case ?
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is, so to speak , amb ig u ous and un i q ue ?
It is right for joint resources to be cont ro ll ed sup r an ation ally and not to be de leg ated to the Member States or the T A O s, as has been the case in the past
It seems that you are propos ing the same old m en u , but with more un s a tis fact ory imp lic ations, restric ting the Commission, so you say, to the task of draw ing up a few White Paper s, as you proposed
My fear - even if you sh ake your he ad , Mr Prodi - is that this will trans l ate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simp le sec ret ar i at for the Council of Minister s
If this is the role that the Commission intend s to play over the next five years, we f eder al ists are conv in c ed, we are certain that this is not the right p ath to take and we shall s end for you and jud ge what the Commission intend s to do in this regard
The reform is important but, if it ag gra v ates the situ ation, redu ces or weak ens the sup r an ational po w ers of the Commission, then the structure of European integr ation, as plan n ed by the found ing f ath ers for the European Commission, will be at risk
As for the other point s, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example : the European social mod el is certainly experi en cing a major crisis and it is certainly not co in cid ent al that unemployment top s the list of problems that n one of our policies has man aged to resol ve , but it is not certain that it can be resol ved by going through a list of problems that we have discuss ed in the past , without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contain s econom ies that are grow ing at some of the most sustainable r ates and that it is not by ch ance that these are the econom ies which have made l ab our market flex ibility and enter pr ise their pri me objective
If we continue to get b og ged down with proposals that have given extremely po or results so far , I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself , without it being link ed to a reform to make the European Union and its struct ures much more effic ient , and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps cont r ary to the opinion of some Member s, regarding the te le gram that you s ent to the Austrian Government
We appro ve of your position on this : you did well not to is ol ate that country any further
In any case, we shall see what specific step s transp ire when the time comes for practical action
Mr Prodi, I repe at that this is, in our opinion, a s light ly short -si ght ed view
A b ove all, it lack s d ri ve in the sect ors I have mention ed, for example, as regards the B alk ans
C an we really continue to le ave the B alk ans out of the enlargement proces s, dis reg ard ing the fact that C ro a ti a, M ac ed on ia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all ?
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to app la ud your proposal for a r ad ical dec entral isation of the Union' s activities and ask wh y, then , you are propos ing a legislative programme which would lead to central isation
I re me mber your pre d ecess or ' s speech five years ag o
Li ke your self , he prom ised " less and better " , but Mr S an ter fin ish ed up by having deli ver ed " m uch more and much wor se " , and I do not believe that you, e ith er, can deli ver the goods you prom ise
You talk about dec entral isation but prac ti se central isation
The legislative programme is, in fact, a l it an y of subject s over which the people are to be de pri ved of inf lu ence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take inf lu ence away from the people , even on social questions
You talk about greater transparency , but produ ce proposals which would lead to docu ments which, at present , are available for public ins pe ction being loc k ed away
Y our Commission cons ists of the only 2 0 people in the EU who can propose that the qu an tit y of legislation should be redu ced
L oc al poli ti ci ans cannot do that, once legislation has been pass ed in Brus sels
The legislative programme from the Commission o u ght at least , therefore, to be acc om p an ied by as long a list of tas ks which are to be refer red back to the Member States and to the process es of po p ular democracy
O ther wise , the number of law s produ ced in Brus sels will just keep on grow ing
We have pass ed 1 0 0 00 law s and as many amendment s, and the applic ant States have had 2 6 0 00 docu ments s ent to them which, as deb ated by the P ol ish parliament , f ill 1 4 0 0 00 s id es of p aper
E ven by this stage , that is already too many by far
Brus sels should make decisions on fe wer matters and hand over more decisions to the people , the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brus sels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliament s can no longer legisl ate on effective ly
What is more , the work carried out in Brus sels should be of a much high er quality and be completely transpar ent, so that people might at least have some small sense of own ing the proces s, now that Mr Prodi and his pre d ecess or have taken their a ut on om y away from them
I should also just like to draw Mr De ll ' Al b a ' s attention to what the found ing f ath ers of the European Union d ream ed of
T ake a look at J e an Mon et ' s m em o ir s
What he env is aged was what he call ed a small , practical sec ret ar i at
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today
Madam President, this mor ning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out amb iti ous go als for the European Union for the next five years, la ud able aim s inde ed, to make a strong and effective European pres ence f el t in the world : suc ceed ing with enlargement , meeting the challenge of se ll ing e - E uro pe , introdu cing better principles of govern ance
We accept that European s, particularly the y oun g er gener ation, need to be given a broad pers pe ctive of where Europe will be in the years a he ad
But how are we to suc ceed when the resources available are limited and the cre di bility of our institutions is not very high ?
We need to mat ch this v ision with reality
H ere there are three ele ments I would like to contrib ute
Firstly, we need a successful European economy
We must ensure that unemployment r ates continue to go down ac ross Europe, confirm the tr end in priv a tis ation and d ere g ul ation, encoura ge the ins er tion of information techn olog y and know ledge of the Intern et , show that e - E uro pe is a good initiative
But we must avoid l ur ch ing back into the old - st y le regul ation, sti f ling individual initiative and enter pr ise
We must not fear global is ation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political imp act in the net work soci ety
With out a successful European economy we cannot meet the chall eng es a he ad , particularly of enlargement
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legisl ate only when necessary - subsidiarity
Do ing less but better - a central pl ank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too
We will be look ing at this close ly when we come to the ann ual programmes of proposed legislation
Mr B ond e was right to say that there is this im age of doing less better and then su d den ly we see an ann ual programme for the year 2000 of 5 00 proposals and recommend ations, which seems to go in a different dire ction
We must establish prior ities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes
L ast ly, we need to ensure that there is prop er, g en u ine reform of the European Commission
Y es, the Commission - gu ard ian of the Trea ties - is me ant to be an independent bod y, but it also has to be account able to European citizens through our Parliament
The information problem , which Mr B ond e just refer red to , is treat ed like a st ra w in the w ind , with the Commission seem ing to restric t information to us, as citizens and as parliament ar ian s, although we have the right to it under the Trea ties
The Commission is not in fact today a European government
The Commission does not ref lect the majority in this particular Parliament
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the sh ap ing of govern ance in Europe
This govern ance therefore needs to be a sen si tive govern ance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its rele vant role to play
Therefore we need to have cre di bility , co her ence and confidence that in working together we can rest ore the im age of the European Union to our citizens
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, num erous step s have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the e uro to resolution s on a common security policy ; even to the response by the 1 4 , the Commission and Parliament to the new co al ition in Austria
I fully end or se the ph il os oph y and the principles behind these decisions
N on eth el ess, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more step s to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to m ast er the h uge , in e v it able task of enlargement or to control current and potential move ments which, to put it m ild ly, have an amb i val ent at tit ud e towards European values of democracy and to ler ance and the des ire to integr ate all the people on our contin ent
That does not apply to Austria al one
The Union prof ess es its fa ith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirm ed this fa ith once again when the new co al ition was form ed in Austria
However, the full potential of these values will only be real ised if they are set out in compreh ensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis , represent legal cla im s on the part of individual citizens
When it comes down to it, Artic les 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough
In this sense , the Commission must ins ist , and I should like to end or se and confirm this here , that the new Ch arter of Fund amental Right s become part of the Treaty and create b ind ing, en for ce able rights
In this sense , the Commission must ins ist on build ing up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I dis ag ree with the last two speak ers
On ly reason able , fe a sible and human e principles of immig ration and asylum law can c oun ter the ir r ational , mis le ad ing and dem ag og ic al leg ations of the extre me right
But , and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be acc om p an ied by a co her ent and conv in cing policy to promote employment and prevent social exc lusion because unemployment , mar gin al isation and grow ing in equ ality are the best b reed ing ground s for anti - E uro pe an , national istic actions and re ac tions
In this respect , Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of global isation which you specul ated on and how it is per ce i ved by large s eg ments of the population
The feel ing of being at the m er cy of other s, of lack ing in inf lu ence and of having no protection from the state lead s in the best case sc en ar i o to a lack of interest in politic s and a ref us al to vote , as in the European ele ctions and, in the wor st case sc en ar i o, to extre m ist voting p at tern s
The Union, like everyone else , has not yet under st o od how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the ne g ative effects of global isation
We are in the process of build ing a h ouse but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our h ouse
What we need are not just reform s of the W or ld T ra de O r gan isation and the economic ar ch it ect ure - and, significant ly, the President of the Commission for g ot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial ar ch it ect ure ; we also need confidence -b u ild ing measures for our citizen s, who right ly expect help and support from and in the EU with the in e v it able and p ain ful process of ad ap ting to new global circ um stan ces
In this respect , what the Commission say s about bo os ting Europe ' s v o ice is important
You your self , Mr President, sp o ke of a mod el of which, unfortun ately, there is little mention in the document . You said that we must offer our citizens a mod el of economic , social , cultural and ec ological development, both intern ally and towards the outside world , which di ff ers from other mod el s, including the U S mod el
In this sense , the U S A is not only our partn er ; it is also our compe tit or ; not our opp on ent, our compe tit or and we must fight to see which of us off ers our citizens the best mod el
I hope that what we have said so clearly and v e he ment ly here today will also be re in for ced in the Commission docu ments
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the gre ates t leg ac y which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help res et t le and red ist rib ute the increasing ly j um b led and conf us ed po w ers and compe ten ces of the Commission, and perhaps of the Union itself
You have made a bo ld start by right ly emphas ising the need to focus on so -c all ed " c ore tas ks "
That , as you have said your self today, means that you must also i d enti f y task s, policies and programmes which are peri p her al or ir re le vant to the Commission' s main v oc ation
M an y existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have pass ed their se ll -b y d ate, or have been pro ved un w ield y or in e ff ec tive when ad min ister ed at European level
The challenge now is to have the c oura ge to dev ol ve as many non- c ore tas ks as possible back to low er level s of national , regional and local government
If we are to suc ceed in pers u ad ing a s cep tical European public of the m er it s of further European integr ation, we must be able to demonstr ate that we are as active in the dev olution of un w ar r ant ed EU po w ers as we are in the e v olution of new EU po w ers
We must not allow the critic s of European integration to cla im , as they present ly do with some jus ti fication as we have just he ard from Mr B ond e, that the increase in EU respon sib ili ties is a one - way st re et only
It must be sh own to be a two - way process in which existing EU policies and programm es, which are not clearly jus tif ied on the ground s of subsidiarity and prop or tion ality , are dev ol ved and repe al ed
If you are able to mat ch these as p ir ations with actions in the years a he ad , you will be making an un p re ced ent ed contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have he ard today, you will en j o y w id es p read support in this European Parliament
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I fully support the think ing of the proposals made by my colleag ue , Mrs Ha ut al a, on the Commission' s strategic objectives for the coming five years
I myself want to refer to a subject which has not been mentioned but which is on the agenda , namely the Commission' s work programme for 2000
I am aware of the limit ations of the ex erc ise given that we have to work within the current Treaty and are therefore restric ted by its oper ational rul es. I am think ing in this respect of the important issue of tax ation which I am not, however, going to talk about
R ather , I want to start by wel coming certain proposals which you have made in this programme for 2000
These include all the proposals on food safety which are amb iti ous and important and those on maritime safety which are particularly important given the two oil s lic ks which have affect ed the co ast of Br itt an y and Turke y
The Commission should re act quickly in this respect
However, on other issues the proposals could be more amb iti ous and fa ster ac ting
I have some positive sugg es tions to make , particularly on the social area , the environment and the follow - up to S e at t le
Firstly, you have said that the citizens of Europe must be recon cil ed with the institutions
This is s el f- e vid ent and it is therefore essential to find out their main concerns
For example, in the social area , it is not enough to ann oun ce a communication on a programme of social action
We must move fa ster
You must sub mit a new social action programme to us by the end of the year
The issue of compan y clos ures and m ass red und an ci es is one which has been and still is very firm ly in the new s
We are working on the basis of a directive whose limit ations have been clearly demonst rat ed. I therefore propose that this should be review ed in order to produ ce a directive which is more effective in prot ec ting employment and also in imp os ing p en al ties on those who do not comp ly
On the environment , you have ann oun ced a proposal for a decision on a six th action programme on the environment
This is all very well but it seems that the text to be proposed will not contain any specific objectives or a tim et able for implement ation. P er haps you can correct me on this
I person ally feel that it is essential to have precise objectives and a proper tim et able for implementation
In terms of civil liability for the environment , it is right that we fin ally have a White Paper
However, Parliament did ask for a legislative initiative six years ag o
The White Paper clearly fore s h ad ow s this legislation but for when ?
You must real ise that this process needs to be ac ce ler ated
Finally, after K y ot o, we should be able to r ap id ly produ ce precise proposals
Finally, on the subject of the W T O , the idea of re la un ch ing a new global r ound is not necess arily b ad
However, in the first place , the Commission should make proposals on chang ing the oper ational rules of the W T O
The Commission has a role both within the EU and throughout the world
The European Union must therefore ins tig ate a re - e val u ation of the W T O ' s oper ation which must lead to precise proposals being made on its rules
Madam President, you sp o ke about fundamental political values , and one of the fundamental political values , even more important than democracy , is respect for others
We therefore feel that you act ed correct ly in s ending a m ess age and that perhaps those who prot est ed about it are still feel ing the effects of B ol s he v ism or N a z ism . Dem ocra cy means dialogue with others and making others real ise when they are wr ong , but also list ening to their expl an ations
En l arge ment - and Al le an z a N a z ional e has been repe ating this for t en years in this House - must not mean d il ution , that is, it must not ent ail more ris ks
The applic ant countries ' h op es are at least as important as the h op es of our current fe llow citizen s, who are begin ning to feel b it ter ly dis app oint ed by the way Europe work s, as it is not resol ving the most serious problems
We therefore need to be str ict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be red ra f ted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occ ur red in R om an i a, reach ing as far as B el gra de , but above all, the continu ing sp read of ap ath y as regards major security issues
E ven today, we do not have defin ite ans w ers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power st ations in the e ast ern rep ublic s
We therefore need resources available to sp end before proceed ing to enlargement , so that we can at last establish a European monitoring bod y responsible for monitoring quality of life and living condition s, with the aim of creating a new world where such tra ged ies will no longer occ ur
I would also like to say a few words on A f ric a, Madam President
The third and four th world s have been ab and on ed : just one do ll ar , one and a h alf e uro would be enough to sa ve a great many ch ild r en
Europe, which is so democratic , so prog res sive , does not speak out or take these tra g ic problems on bo ard , while h alf of A f ric a is d ying of A id s and other dis e as es
One final rem ark regarding the Intern et and global isation
G lo bal isation of the economy must not be redu ced to product and quality c er ti fic ation, just as the global isation of politic s must not come to mean le ve ll ing of values or d amp ening of h op es and en th u si as m
The pe op les which do not particip ate and g ra du ally grow more dist ant will le ave the way open for an o lig ar ch y that will take power and le ave control in the hand s of a few
As for the Intern et , Europe has fin ally found the c oura ge to say that we need rules
On a person al not e, ple ase allow me at this time to congratulate the p ir ates who , by ac ting the way they are , are for cing the world to ref lect on the only system which is currently un reg ul ated
We live in a world of rules and regulations : let us regul ate the Intern et too and give our fe llow citizens rules and hope for the future
Madam President, as a P ad an ian tax p ay er, I have already experi en ced the v ice - li ke g ri p of the tax man and form er P ri me Minister of It al y, Mr Prodi, since P ad an ia is li able to It aly for its tax es as well
L ist ening to him just now , I was concerned when he mentioned new resour ces, something that read ily trans l ates as addition al tax ation, in view, inter a li a, of enlargement , that is the ent ry of new States into the Union
But why do they not bu y their own ent r ance t ick et ?
My P ad an ian elect or ate who , than ks to Mr Prodi, have already pa id what in It aly is know n as the European tax - rep a id only in part - have absolutely no intention , than ks once again to Mr Prodi, of pay ing another tax for some one else
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into offic e, the Commission comm itted to p aper the dire ction in which it aim s to st e er the European Union
The ens u ing document is both amb iti ous and b om b as tic
Is it not rather me l od ra m atic to say that " th e world look s up to Europe " ?
M ore over , Europe as a contin ent is a great deal more than just the f i ft een EU Member States
It is not rather amb iti ous to ensure peace , democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less ?
I am particularly int ri gu ed by how the Commission con sid ers bring ing this about
Do es " th e European integration mod el as a r ich sour ce for global administration " imp ly the exp ort of a large -s c al e pers pe ctive and concentr ation of power ?
A cc ord ing to the Commission, ex tern al policy can suc ce ed, provided everyone know s exact ly who is in ch arge !
So who is this then ?
The Commission as a whole , its President per h ap s, the Council ?
You st ated that the new European government requ i res strong institution s, while the Commission want s to focus at the same time on its c ore tas ks
We could not agree more with the l at ter
It is high time that institutions restric ted their scope to act ual cross-border issues and st o pp ed dec k ing out the European car t with po w ers which they are taking away from national authorities
The document m en tions common values on different occasion s
Un fortun ately, I find the reference to the rele vant standards to be lack ing
This ra ises the question as to what these standards and values are based on
I am conv in ced that the B ible , G od ' s word , is the only p ure sour ce of proper standards and real values
In the tra dition of our contin ent, this real isation is an important one which m er it s recogn ition
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by : the strategic objectives for 2000 to 200 5 or your speech for 2000 to 2 01 0 ?
Ha ve you already included your second term of offic e ?
But serious ly
As it enl ar g es, the Union needs to be strengthen ed through st ream l ining and dem ar c ation
First , st ream l ining
What you say in your programme about conc ent ra ting on the c ore f un ctions of the Commission is only the begin ning
The activities of the entire Union must be redu ced to c ore areas of policy
In other words, a social , ec olog ic ally - or ient ated market , a sec ure currency , guarant e ed civil rights intern ally and represent ation of common interests ex tern ally
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one v o ice ; it is what we want to say with this v o ice that it is important
Secondly, the new " in " word is flex ibility
However, increasing flex ibility can or quickly threat ens to turn into inter governmental isation
We must hold fa st to joint decision -m aking institutions which em b ra ce the Member States
That also appli es to the inc lusion of the civil soci et y, which is a welcome step
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new m i x ing of po w ers
(A pp la use )
Trans p ar ency does not mean more access to more p aper ; to our citizen s, transparency means greater cl arity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brus sels and St r as bour g , when and with what right
That is transparency
Th ird ly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge end less ly
It s b ord ers are set not by how may countries want to j o in , but by how many countries it can acc omm od ate
(A pp la use )
If the pr ice of enlargement is the water ing - d own or even the b re ak - up of the present Union, then it must not be pa id
It is too high a pr ice , not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to j o in the Union
There is no future for a Union which is mere ly a g e o - st r ateg ic con cept or for a Union which is mere ly a free trade z one
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be acc red ited by the people of Europe if it se es itself as a community of des tin ies
That goes far be y ond your new economic and social agenda or a new , better quality of life
N ot only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new ans w ers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together
In doing so , we need , no l ess, to re in vent the European Union, but without d est ro ying the present Union
(A pp la use )
Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Li beral Dem ocrat and R ef orm Par t y, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful real isation of enlargement
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a dec is ive attemp t to have each applic ant country j o in the Union as soon as possible
On the other hand, we have to see to it that n one of the achieve ments or aim s of integration that have been st ated th us far are water ed down
To avoid this the European Li beral Dem ocrat s have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various mod els of differ enti ated integration and create a concentr ic Union, in which there is a f eder al c ore and a less integr ated out er r ing
It is clear that the subject of the internal differ enti ation of the Union will be raised at the IGC
The subject needs to be discuss ed without pre j ud ice
A technical improve ment in the flex ibility system will not be enough : we also have to ra ise the issue of develop ing our institutions for the countries in the v ang uard as proposed by J ac ques D el or s, for example
In this way , a decision -m aking system can be creat ed that is more effective , clear er, more open and more democratic
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the exp and ing Union might implement its institution al and other differ enti ation
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner s, your ins p ir ing speech , Mr Prodi, has quite w on me over
It ra ises expect ations, but it can also lead to dis app oint ment
This is conn ect ed to what Mr V an V el z en was just say ing, about the differ ence between words and de ed s
The enlargement of the Union is ins p ire d by our wish for peace , security and st ability
You are look ing to reas s ure the ac ced ing countries, as well as European opinion
But these day s, we are w it ness ing the exact re ver se before our very e y es
We have not ed increasing level s of app reh ension and dis qu i et , even within regions where unemployment is quite low and pro s per ity very high
We need to make our citizens feel at home , according to Mr S w ob od a, and I agree
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility
This is prob ably link ed to the standards mentioned by Mr V an D am , namely subsidiarity
It is necessary to have a clear di vision of responsibility among all level s of authority and to be partn ers, rather than compe tit ors when it comes to policy
It is also necessary to ex erc ise authority as close ly as possible to the citizen s, where it can be ex erc ised with due transparency and can be mon it ore d by the citizens themselves
That will require a new political culture , not only in words, but also in practice , which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions
Reg ion s which, cult ur ally and economic ally, some tim es mat ch the interest of some Member States
The new Europe should not only exp and h or i z on t ally, but also ver tic ally, by living by our values in practice and by develop ing a democratic structure of a real community
This is what the Commission will be jud ged on
Madam President, the Commission is today pres en ting its strategic objectives for 2000 - 2 00 5 . These are contain ed in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been g l os s ed over to prevent any conf lic t
So , in the first part on the new for ms of European govern ance, the words ' f eder al ism ' and ' s u per st ate ' are not mentioned at all
Y et these are the main them es in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day - t o - day tas ks of ex ec ution are dec entral ised and a colle ctive v ision is prom oted within an ind is tin ct whole . In this sc en ar i o the governments and national parliament s are m erg ed with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil soci et y, all of which are des c rib ed, with no form of h i er ar ch y, as ' int eg r al ele ments of European govern ance '
These amb ig u ities m as k many mis u nder stand ing s, pri m arily about our values
It is not enough to cla im to ad h ere to democracy in order to be a dem ocrat
It must clearly be ac cep ted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best comb ines the objective conditions of an immedi ate, fa ir and transpar ent democratic debate , namely at national level in the main
Y et the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opp os ite the or y. In this the or y, on the pre te xt of ens uring the best protection for pe op l es, their mar gin of independent ch o ice should be increasing ly limited by new regul ations, new policies or new , restric tive legal struct ures such as the draft Ch arter of Fund amental Right s
This Ch arter is really mis n am ed because it will actually redu ce these rights
In the Union for a Europe of N ations Group our principles are rather different
C lear ly we want to def end the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the a ut on om y of n ations
This is not imp os sible
We must move away from the out m od ed f eder al ist sch em es prom oted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the M em o i res of J e an Mon n et
In st ead , we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flex ible d y n am ic which respect s n ations
This is the key n ote idea on the new govern ance which we would have li k ed to have seen in your communic ation, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortun ately not there
Madam President, Mr Prodi, you cla im to be sh ap ing a new Europe yet you are lack ing one basic e lement : confidence
The confidence of million s of European s cannot be w on without being worth y of this
And how could you be worth y of this after the m ad c ow sc and al and the res ign ation of the S an ter Commission for cor ru p tion ?
You are responsible for million s of une mploy ed and for million s living in po ver t y, in sec urity and increasing mis er y because of your u l t ra - t ra de - or ient ed and u l t ra - li beral policies and because of the for ced mar ch towards the single currency
You want ed and have ob tain ed the ab o li tion of internal border s. Con sequ ent ly, you have open ed Europe up to an exp lo sion in crime and in sec urity and to a f lo od of un con t ro ll ed immig ration
You are now propos ing to give all decision -m aking power to a hand ful of official s. The Member States, local authorities and N G O s will simply become en for c ers of decisions hand ed down from above , all on an equal fo oting in their sub m ission to Brus sels
N ot once does your tw el ve - p age document mention the national parliament s even though they comp r ise the elect ed representatives of the people
C lear ly, they have no role to play in your strategy
You d are not even call a sp ade a sp ade , but inst ead h ide behind p se ud o - t r end y l ang u age by using the term ' go vern ance ' for what is nothing more than f eder al , a ut ocra tic , central ised government
Ha ving t ried for many years to pers u ade us by talking of sh ared so ver e ign t y, you are now re ve al ing your u l tim ate go al . You intend to trade in all European so ver e ign t y, whether national or colle ctive , for a world government in which you do not even expect to ob tain a d om in ant position
Finally, you are d ar ing to con d em n and p en al ise the free and democratic vote of million s of Austrian s, or are allow ing this to happen , just because the result does not su it you . Y et at the same time you are supp or ting Comm un ist Ch in a and tra d ing with countries which have open ly vi ol ated human rights for dec ad es
Members of this House are today spe aking out against a te le gram from Mr Prodi to Ch ance ll or Sch ü s sel which, quite obvious ly, is not a demonst ration of sy mp ath y but rather a political man o e u v re
Y our sa b re - rat t ling fo ol s no one because , as you know perf ect ly well , whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Trea ties and harmon ise sa ving s tax
You will c y n ic ally and h y p oc ri tic ally use Austria as a con ven ient threat to further st ri p the Member States of any real po w ers in the con struction of the European Union
Y our Commission ers are clearly not so le ly responsible for this
The governments which, through sp in el ess ness or ide olog y, support you are also responsible
Brus sels is not all of us, as you cla im . It is all of you
T e ll the tr uth for once . You could not care less what the people of Europe want
They are free to ch o ose only between your b ra ve new world and d en oun ce ment
It is over t en years since the co ll ap se of the So v i et Union and yet your projects contain a strong h int of the g ul ag s and mo ll if ying mor al ism
We were among the small number who d en oun ced the commun ist d ict at ors hip
We are and will remain among those f igh ting against European ist d ict at ors hip
We call on all the people of Europe to res ist your mon st r ous projects
The s al v ation of European democra ci es is with n ation states . Europe ' s s al v ation li es in the cooperation of the n ations of Europe
( L im ited app la use )
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission' s five - y ear programme, and it has many objectives that we end or se . It is a programme based on real - life situ ations and issues , and it is therefore right to put conc re te measures a side for the moment and focus on the major issues
In my view, Mr Prodi, jud g ing from the text and the document that you had s ent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given second ary importance , and that is solidarity , not so much at international level as at internal level
The Ar ch b ish op of M il an , Mon si gn or C ar lo Mar ia Mar tin i , is call ing upon all poli ti ci an s, in particular those like you and me , President Prodi, for wh om the cultural and hist or ic principle behind their pres ence in politic s is the principle of the active involve ment of C ath olic s in politic s, to recon sider a development proces s, which, in addition to economic pro fit , takes the mar gin al ised and those left behind by soci ety very much into account
It is of the u t most importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up , one which remind s us of how difficult and comp lic ated it is to establish progress indic at ors and how in ade qu ate it is to use the par am et er of per cap it a inc ome al one
It also remind s us of the need for a new grow th mod el , one that is firm ly ro oted in the culture of the C ath olic s who are involved in social problem s, who see , in the civil community and the social inter action that that must be encoura ged and fa cil it ated among the public , the most nat ural instru ments for build ing solidarity
The fundamental e lement for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic g ain - is th us en h an ced
This social freedom, which bec om es man if est in initiatives favour ing the po or , gi ves excellent results in terms of social justice and st ability
Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic crit er ion
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achie ving freedom for each individual , without for get ting , nat ur ally, that all this cannot and must not conf lic t with the need to create bus ines s, to invest and risk , and in an order ed and focus ed system , ent re pr ene urs are able to make a substan ti al contribution to social grow th solidarity
In the a ge of global is ation, which we do want to fa cil it ate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarant ees to the economic oper at ors and consum ers, the European Commission cannot for get solidarity , and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man ' s spirit ual resources in his relations with his fe llow man
Our her it age has t au ght us that politic s must have a hear t
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ' S h ap ing the new Europe ' is an amb iti ous objective both for the Commission and for us all
Our amb i tions and our work will be follow ed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union
What s ort of imp ression will an interest ed public , as well as the rest of the world , have of this five - y ear programme ?
My rep ly would be : a new start , a clear agenda for reform which conf ir ms that the Union in the 2000 s will not st op at being an economic community but will become a community that can be tr ust ed and that we take serious ly
The Commission is correct in st ating that the Union intend s to develop and saf eg uard the wel f are state in an a ge of global is ation. It fore se es a just and more effective Europe that also recogn ises its respon sib ili ties be y ond its own b ord ers out of solidarity and en light en ed s el f- in ter est
Con sequ ent ly, we see po ver ty and exc lusion as the gre ates t en em ies of peace and freedom
I conc ur with what other members of my political group have said and I comm end the t one of your document . However, there are two o m ission s which need to be address ed in our future work
The first concerns women , g ender and women 's rights
You talk ed about how women can help in increasing produ ction and grow th
That is important , but equ ality is not only necessary for produ c tiv ity , but also to make our soci e ties more democratic
It is therefore no tice able that ' equ ality ' , ' g ender ' and ' w omen ' are b are ly mentioned in ' S h ap ing the N e w Europe '
You mentioned ' w omen ' in your speech , but they are not refer red to in the context of the strategic go als
Is that because main st ream ing is already so w id es p read in the Commission that there is no need to mention women ?
What other expl an ation could there be for o mit ting women ?
The EU must not take on a m as cul ine person a
My other question concerns A f ric a, which is the only contin ent not mentioned in ' S h ap ing the N e w Europe '
A f ric a has the l ar g est number of refuge es in the world , the most over all po ver ty and a deb il it ating A I D S e p id em ic
I know that Commissioner N i els on and some of the other Commission ers are doing a fin e job , but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that contin ent, part ly by including it among its strategic go als
Finally, I welcome the Commission' s statement and the fact that this say s for the first time that the EU is prepared un il ater ally to introdu ce measures to make it e a si er for develop ing countries to g ain access to our market s
I would mere ly ask when this is like ly to take effect
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a v ital document for the future and f ate of Europe
However, out of all the point s, two specifically require our attention , and they are close ly link ed : peace and st ability within Europe and outside Europe
It is a question of objectives that must be purs u ed as a priority . For some time, we have all ag reed on this no tion , but we must also clearly aff irm that these objectives will not be achie ved without enlargement , even if this comes at a pr ice
T od ay , we have been call ed on to ch o ose , for the forth coming dec ad es, between a Europe that might be less pro sp erous but a be ac on of peace and civil isation for the whole plan et and a Europe that might be more we alth y, but where there is un c ertain ty over what the future might bring
These go als will be more e a si ly ob tain able only if the Intergovernmental Conference , which will draw to a close within the year , results in cons titutional reform , provid ing the Commission with real and ad equ ate po w ers so that it will no longer mere ly implement Council decisions or Parliament' s cod ec ision s but will have to perf orm the role of a real European government
The first support er of this reform should be Parliament itself , if it really want s to increase its role of inter p re ting the will of the European s and ac qu ire the c entr ality which is part of a g en u ine ly democratic and firm ly integr ated Union
M ore over , it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tas ks it takes on according to the act ual po w ers it will be accord ed
With out these pro s pect s that we have out lin ed, Europe would , once again , have no future
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the over all intention of the objectives ann oun ced which are in line with the chall eng es which Europe must over come
I note that you consider the fall of the B er lin w all to be the crucial fact or of the end of the cent ur y
This event must under p in enlargement
R ather than using the word ' en l arge ment ' , I want to talk of re un ific ation which has much greater political signific ance
Y our idea is to concentr ate your activities on the c ore task s. This is one of the go als of your reform
In ess ence this means apply ing the principle of subsidiarity
P re c ise application of this principle can only re in for ce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of compe t ence
However, saying is one thing and doing is another !
You must therefore fight against the t end ency of all institutions to tr y and increase their po w ers
I will therefore jud ge you on your de ed s
In the mean ti me , I appro ve and encoura ge this clearly expressed des ire in your communication
However, I must make two essential point s. These concern the simp li fication and application of Community law
In 1998 , 12 3 refer r als were made to the Court of Justice for non- app lic ation or non- t rans p o sition and 2 5 % of environmental dire ctives were not appli ed or transp osed
R ec ent event s have sh own us that these regulations are essential
Community law must not go un app li ed because it is too comple x or too p ed an tic
The Union must not make this m ist ake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this
You are being real istic when you say that the wel f are state can no longer provide ad equ ate respon s es to the problems fa cing us, including unemployment
N ever thel ess, I regret that a clear al tern ative has not been proposed
The emphas is should have been pla ced on the re jec tion of any policy of hand out s and inst ead on the development of initiative and responsibility
You have not high light ed the a ge ing of our population which will fund ament ally al ter the structure of our soci et y, not only economic ally but also in terms of public health
This is a s il ent rev olution and in this respect I expect ed more from your communication
Finally, you do high light European research as being at the hear t of our future
Y et you do not indic ate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this
Al so , e th ical principles are at the hear t of this research but your communication say s nothing about these
If you want to better inform the people , you should start by strengthen ing li a is on with this House , as we are the representatives of the citizens
Madam President, we can only end or se the general guidelines of the five - y ear programme and of the programme for 2000 , set out with so much en th u si as m by President Prodi this mor ning
In the two document s, strong emphas is is pla ced on the need to def ine new for ms of European govern ance and, to this end , to introdu ce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more str ing ent prior ities in the purs u it of the go al of full employment , through more effic ient coordin ation of the economic and social policies of the States, and, pri m arily - allow me to stress this - of the n ations that have j o ined the mon etary un ion and which must be en abled to become the first example of clos er cooperation
To this end , I shall conf ine myself to stress ing, out of all the ch o ic es available , the importance of three priority decisions which should , in the draw ing - up of action programmes for the government of the Union, be the basis for both the Commission' s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months
Firstly, the prom o tion of and participation in the dra f ting of joint plans for the cre ation of an integr ated services net work in the transport and energy sector s, with the back ing of the European In ves t ment B ank
Secondly, the appro val of invest ments - where the par am et ers are b ind ing when draw ing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries v ia Community projects in the priority sect ors of research , innov ation and training
I feel that these par am et ers - particularly those of a qu al it ative nature , res ul ting from invest ments in continu ous tra in ing, ref res her cour s es, ad ap t ability and ret ra ining of old er work ers - are consider ably more significant and b ind ing o w ing to their l as ting effects over the medium term than the simp le draw ing up of ann ual qu an tit ative objectives , that are always deb at able , regarding new employment or employment c ut s
If , among other thing s, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stress es as well , the Commission could promote a new ph ase of social dialogue , focus ing on an ag reed strategy of social isation and di ff u sion of know ledge , in other words, a strategy for employ ability and the defin ition of its rul es, this would allow us to take a step towards having employ ees particip ate in the inform ed and cons ens ual management of the rest ruct uring and re e mployment process es
Th ird ly, I do not think that the dec re ase in the number of the working popul ation, o w ing to the a ge ing of the popul ation, is un a vo id able and in e v it able for the European Union. This is not just because of the exist ence of mar gin s which would per mit an increase in the number of working women and immig r ation, but because we need to be deter min ed in re vers ing the w id es p read tr end of ear ly re tire ments from the job market , and direct the coordin ated reform of social wel f are system s, certainly not towards large redu ctions in future p ension pay ments but towards the active use of people ' s increased life expect an cy and towards a longer working life
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reform ist and amb iti ous mo od
I welcome you and your amb ition
Am b ition will be need ed, given the m am m oth task which aw a it s us
In order to make these reform s, however, and in order to make progress with the 200 1 legislative programme, we must be very sure , not only of the strength s of the reform er him self , but also of the opinion s of others
You say that you will not h es it ate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are w alk ing on th in financial i ce
We have 1 . 2 7 % of the Community ' s G D P
N ot a e uro more or a e uro less
It will not be us who ref use these new resour ces. You should ask the Council
These financial pers pe ctives are ad j ust ed to within a m ill im et re
In order to fin ance the st ability plan for the B alk an s, we will have to negoti ate a significant re vision of C ateg ory 4 , and you must re me mber the en orm ous difficulties we have had in appro ving the 2000 budget
I would remind you that this Group , the P P E - D E , does not like to fin ance new political initiatives at the exp en se of existing on es
The political prior ities must be set by this House and the M E P s
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will dis gu ise the limit ations of the Community financial system
It is all very well for us, by m ut ual cons ens u s, to make an effort in terms of budget ary r ational is ation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resour ces, the abs ence of financial a ut on om y and the po or ex ec ution of the budget , continue to be urg ent issues which must be resol ved
We therefore w on der whether the Commission has the political will to resol ve them
Madam President, the Commission communication is well wr itt en but su ffic i ently v ag ue to allow any inter p ret ation what so ever
On one hand, there are the words and, on the other , their real political mean ing
We Social ists app la ud the Commission for w an ting to fight against social exc lusion and po ver ty
Y et how can the g ul f between political r h et or ic and reality be f ill ed ?
What is me ant by the Commission' s dec la red objective of ' ec on om ic reform ' in the l ab our market ?
Do es this mean more flex ibility , in sec urity and f i x ed -term contra ct s ?
E ver y one know s that quality of life and full and better employment dep end on sustainable economic grow th
The Union is currently restric ted to a policy of st ability which is certainly necessary but ins u fficient
We Social ists des per ately want a European p act for grow th and employment
The in g re di ents of this policy are well know n . They are the sti m ul ation of public and priv ate invest ment , increased invest ment in research , e du c ation and training and the prom o tion of the spirit of enter pr ise
In this respect , the e - E uro pe initiative is to be wel com ed
In the world of new techn olog ies, the main dang er remain s that access to information will be e a si er the r ich er you are
The g ul f s which are open ing up every wh ere are the main problem for our e ra
On one hand we have the ex u ber ance of the financial market s and the exp lo sion of we alth and, on the other , more w id es p read exc lusion
We are ask ing work ers to be flex ible , innov ative and ever more produ ctive , yet the f ru it s of this produ c tiv ity increasing ly benefit the share ho ld ers al one
The European C entral B ank is keep ing very qu i et about the st ag g er ing r ates of ret urn on financial as se t s, yet it never mis s es an opportunity to remind us that any w age increase should remain be low the r ate of increase in produ c tiv ity
How do we explain to work ers who fall vic tim to the r ational is ations of the world w ide Mon op o ly g a me that they must be prepared to change care er several tim es in their working li ves when the cap tain s of industry , having lo st the g am ble of a take - over , le ave with comp ens ation of EUR 3 0 million ?
For years we have been to ld over and over that the economy must be li beral ised
The sect ors which have been li beral ised are experi en cing an av al an ch e of m erg ers and ac qu is ition s, lead ing in e v it ably to mon op o ly situ ations
All these st ock market b at t les are based so le ly on fore c ast increas es in pro fit of 15 % , 2 0% or 2 5 % which are un re al istic in the long term
The un f et ter ed r ise in pr ic es of financial as se ts and proper ty means that the ris ks are on the increase
The main dang er aw a iting us in the medium term is not inf l ation but def l ation caus ed by the co ll ap se of the specul ative b ub b les on the international financial market s
To conclud e, the next five years will be crucial
We need new rules to regul ate global isation and we need invest ment in the real economy and in people
We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social di men sion of the market economy in a vis ible man ner
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner s, in my view, this strategy p aper has two clear weak ness es
There is no point in draw ing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even fin ish ed the old one
I am think ing of transport policy and regional policy
You have excellent Commission ers for both issues in Mrs Pal a ci o and Mr B arn i er, yet still you att ach too little importance to these areas
And do you know why ?
J ust look at transport policy ; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be dra wn up as a economic ally and ec olog ic ally sen sible policy before the ac ces sion of other countries
I would be gr ate ful if the President of the Commission would list en to what I have to say, although of course he has no oblig ation to do so
Let me give you three examp les
First : we need reason able d ere g ul ation of the ra il way sector because we want to sh i ft f re ight from the road s to the ra il ways
That makes sense from an economic and an ec ological point of view
With out d ere g ul ation we will not make any he ad way with a reason able transport policy
The same appli es to European a ir tra ffic control
Our citizens cannot understand that we are d ere g ul ating a ir tra ffic , but le a ving 15 different sect ors in the s k ies which are under national control , which have an ad ver se economic imp act on the a ir l ines and which po ll ute the environment
You still have not fin ish ed that agenda
Commissioner, far too little is said in your p aper about regional policy
E conom ic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less fa v ou red regions will d read enlargement
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them j o in the r ich regions by prom oting the less fa v ou red regions using reason able means
Th en they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the r ich and the po or regions, then this Union will be all the po or er and it will not meet with the appro val of the people
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner s, the fact that we are form ul ating new programmes does not mean that we should ne g lect those old er programmes which are at implementation stage
F rom that stand p oint , it is use ful that the Commission' s work programme comes back to the issues of Ag enda 2000 , the common agric ult ural policy, which includ es fish ing, and second ly, the activities of the structural funds
I hope this reference means that the re or gan isation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the m ech an ism for monitoring and implementing Ag enda 2000
The Ag enda 2000 issues are , of course, on es that rel ate to your third and four th strategic objectives , the economic and social Ag enda and a better quality of life
What your text s do not make app ar ent is the extent to which these major , high - min d ed objectives are comp a ti ble with the resources that the Commission intend s to dep loy
I do not necess arily mean financial resources
The implementation of Ag enda 2000 in the agric ult ural sector does not u l tim ately require more money
There must also be sa ving s
But what we need is the analy tical resources : these issues require the invest ment of more int el lect ual capital
This is because it is essential to achieve two things : the European mod el of mul tif unction ality in agric ulture must be sec ure d , and this must be done in a way which fa cil it ates the li beral isation of world trade in agric ult ural product s, main ly to the benefit of develop ing countries
It is not e as y to comb ine those aim s
There is no obvious way
There may well be contra dic tions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has point ed out those contra dic tions and how it propos es to deal with them
As regards the other aspect of Ag enda , the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achieve ments to point to , but there are still less develop ed regions, particularly is land regions, to which more attention should be pa id
As for fish ing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the pre d atory exp lo it ation of fish ing ground s, which has g one as far as to w i pe out entire speci es of fish , will certainly pro ve f ru it ful in the future
P er haps these issues should be approach ed with greater attention and a greater es p rit de fin es se
Madam President, I want to start by re in for cing the ca ution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in address ing this five - y ear plan
In set ting very amb iti ous long -term go als we must not take our e y es away from the present
That was a point made very for ci b ly by the lead er of my group , Mr P o et ter ing, in his open ing address
The Union must not take on a whole r ange of new tas ks without the basic found ation for a successful European economy being in place
That found ation is clearly the single market
How strong ly is the single market established at the moment ?
I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here , of the find ings of the Commission' s own sur ve y among 3 000 European business es
N ear ly 4 0% of business es in this sur ve y are still rep or ting addition al costs to r ender product s or services comp a ti ble with national specific ations
This is the Commission' s own sur ve y
These are the cl ass ic sy mp t om s of continu ed ob struction by national governments - bureauc ra tic red - t a pe b l ock ing market ent ry
The Commission' s programme show s a dist ur b ing comp la c ency about the comple tion of the internal market
We have to keep the press ure up in all areas by rem o ving further b ar ri ers, int en si f ying press ure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, ext ending into crucial new areas like financial services
On ly on the strong found ation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successful ly achie ved
An enl ar ged Europe must build on the existing strength s of the Union
The single market ext ending ac ross that enl ar ged Union is going to be a col os s al achieve ment
I conclud e by say ing, on behalf of all my Con s erv ative colleagues - and we are the second l ar g est national de leg ation in this Parliament - that we pl ed ge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achie ving this hist or ic task
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner s, I should like to start with a qu ote : " T he Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Ch arter of Fund amental Right s and draw up proposals to bring about an amb iti ous programme
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a g en u ine European policy on asylum and immig r ation. It wishes to bo ost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all for ms of crime "
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security , freedom, citizens ' rights and judicial cooperation
A p aper this short is a far ce
A far ce because we know and app re ci ate the work of Commissioner V itor in o and what we have here on p aper is a b l at ant contra dic tion to how things actually stand
A p aper such as this is no basis for a sc ore b o ard
It has been ext o ll ed and c e le b r ated as a h uge achieve ment and I am all for it ; we need a basis for a sc ore b o ard
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme
What we are look ing for are min imum standards in asylum proced ures so that refuge es can be given help quick ly, and those who are not fle e ing know where they stand
We want instru ments to prevent ab use
We want to develop a Community immig ration policy which takes account of the Member States ' cap ac ity to abs or b immig r ants and we need to extend the oper ational po w ers of EUR O P O L , for example, so that specific step s can be taken to combat organ ised crime
We debate these issues int ensive ly and serious ly and we should be en tit led to expect like wise from the Commission, even where it is mere ly sub mit ting a p aper
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner s, I r ise to speak on the subject of the W or ld T ra de O r gan is ation, on which there is a broad con ver g ence of views between the Commission docu ments and the posi tions of the Social ist Group
This is not the case in other areas, as has already been point ed out
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade , but we want this trade to be con du ct ed according to common standard s, common rules which would regul ate world trade with one aim in mind . This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmon ious development in which the values of citizens hip do not only apply to the world ' s most d y n am ic and competi tive regions
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles ?
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased vol u me of trade for the W or ld T ra de O r gan is ation, in other words, increased we alth , but when we look at how this we alth is dist rib ut ed, we see , unfortun ately, that the g ul f between the world ' s r ich est countries and b l oc ks and the po ore st and least develop ed countries contin ues to increase
It is therefore quite leg iti m ate and even imp er ative that we ask ourselves , what purp ose do the current common standards and rules s erve ?
What good are the current way in which we negoti ate and the way in which the W or ld T ra de O r gan isation work s, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other , they create problems and above all cause this g ul f between r ich and po or countries to grow ?
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission out l ined here for the S e at t le negotiations and for l ater on es
We are certainly in favour of this strategic v ision but we need to be b ra ve and amb iti ous
We need to be demand ing and ensure that social right s, environmental rights and consum er protection are incorpor ated into the forth coming negotiations
M ost important ly though , we must have a b ra ve and amb iti ous long -term v ision for reform , not just of the W T O but also of the I L O , the United N ations and above all, of the financial institution s, specifically the I M F and the W or ld B ank
We must be b ra ve and not only see some aspect s of global is ation. We must be b ra ve enough to have more of an over v iew of this proces s, so that we alth does not only benefit the most high ly - de velop ed b l oc ks and countries, but that there is also harmon ious change and development in every region in the world
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission' s initiative of pres en ting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intend s, in sub sequ ent document s, to avoid the ex cess of general is ations and the v ag u en ess of the text which we are exam ining today
Ha ving said this, Madam President, I am prepared , once again , to be a v o ice c ry ing in the w ild ern ess as a result of the abs ence of a fish ing policy
It is really sur p ris ing that the Commission does not treat the re vision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 200 2
There is no doubt what so ever that this re vision process will be the most important thing to affect the fish ing industry for many years
However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is oblig ed to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the function ing of the common fish eri es policy over the last dec ade before the end of 200 1 , and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its mod ific ation
In fact, the re vision process has already be g un for many bod ies and institution s, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already iss u ed and adopted a report po in ting out all the current problems and de fic i en ci es of the common fish eri es policy
We have often asked for a basic tim et able for this re vision and we have received no rep ly
L ess than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fish ing policy is an om al ous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such an om al ies should be resol ved within the framework of this reform process
Therefore , Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue , which is of v ital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years
Madam President, I should like to add my congratul ations to Commissioner Prodi 's programme
I particularly welcome his recogn ition of this v ir t u ous circ le of having sustain ed grow th : the information soci ety in an exp and ing European market with the addition of a fully function ing single currency which will give us the opportunity to g en u ine ly promote pro s per ity , innov ation enter pr ise , the ent re pr ene ur ial spirit and y es - most important ly of all - ext ra - h igh value sustainable jobs for our European citizens
I have one obs erv ation, not a critic ism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi 's statement this mor ning and that is that it was a little weak on the act ual cont ent of economic policy
We must not take any thing for grant ed in terms of how we get the European economy rest ruct ure d
A fter all, what is social justice if it is without full employment ?
F ull employment is the best way to gener ate social justice for our citizens
This is a key priority for us to focus on
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us : in particular Commissioner Li i k an en 's commitment to having an innov ative know ledge - d ri ven economy
Y es, e - E uro pe will be the future for us because it will help us create new pro s per ity and new jobs
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium -si zed enter p ris es and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a ch arter for m ic ro -b us iness es
That is important and something that can be develop ed through the L is b on S um mit
I also welcome Commissioner B us qu in 's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union
Ag ain , this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for pro s per ity
You said in your su m m ary , Commissioner Prodi, that li beral is ation, competi tiven ess, keep ing inf l ation low , innov ation, sci ence and techn olog y are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs
I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for grant ed. There is still more we have to do , and the L is b on S um mit will become part of that
So with those rem ark s I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme
To me , this Commission strategy p aper for the next five years read s like a scientific p aper on the European Union or a dec l ar ation of principle
Un fortun ately, it does not give the imp ression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission
As the sp ok es p ers on for cultural and training policy for my group , I would have expect ed more in the way of agenda from an It al ian President of the Commission
The Commission gi ves no s ou l to Europe
C ulture and training simply do not exist in this p ap er, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe
J ust a few main points
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture ; they create jobs
I am talking about the introdu ction of cultural main st ream ing in all policy areas, about con so lid ating and impro ving the European di men sion of training and e du c ation sy ll ab us es and about net work ing training and e du c ation policies in Europe especially li f el ong le ar ning
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new m ill en n ium and you made no mention what so ever of the a ud i o - v is ual area of Europe
N or was any mention made of information policy and communic ations c ater ing to the needs of our citizens
It seems to me that something is mis s ing from this programme
T ru ly European citizens hip dep end s on our creating a real , vis ible area of training and culture
D ec l ar ations of principle are not enough
We need an agenda which can be trans l ated into political action by the Commission on an on go ing basis in the way in which I have just des c rib ed
Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take st ock of your policy and work programme, what would your b ench mark be , if you had to make direct ch o ic es ?
You have the fin e, ch arm ing idea that the out come and the b ench mark for your policy and for your five - y ear programme will be the result of the ele ction s, or rather the turn out at the next European ele ctions
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in , week out to my constit u ent s, not in the r are f ied at m os ph ere of this House , but on the st re et , then I ask myself , what can I say ?
Mr Prodi, what can I say ; what is there that is new ?
There is nothing new in your work programme
You have taken 12 p ag es for five years and 1 8 p ag es for one year ' s work programme
Do es that give me hope for the year 2000 ?
No , it does not !
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite c le ver
You say that environmental consider ations must be integr ated into all other policy areas
Ha ve you done so , Mr Prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ?
No , you have not done so
You have not integr ated environmental policy into enlargement , despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement
N or have you integr ated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market
You have not integr ated it any wh ere
You have t ack ed a few comp on ents together but you have no over all structure
You said ear li er in your speech that a disaster such as that of the D an ub e is an example of the need for an em erg ency structure ; no , Mr Prodi, we need , at long last , to start transp os ing legislation and ens uring that legislation is mon it ore d
You say in your five - y ear programme that the people of the European Union right ly expect food standards to be high er and better food st u ff s legislation
Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about
The food st u ff s legislation in the European Union is the most amb iti ous in the world
Wh ere it fall s short , what is mis s ing, is transp o sition in the Member States and monitoring
It is time you to ok your job serious ly, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to bo x the Member States on the ear s and force them to do their work and fulf il their d u ties
It is no good sp ending time on ho b b ies when there is a day ' s work to be done
That is what we expect of you in the next five years
( E S ) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as ch air man of this Parliament' s Committee on F ish eri es, Mr Prodi, you are not making things e as y for me at all
I feel d ut y b ound to public ly d en oun ce the fact that fish ing is abs ent from the programme which you have presented to us
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you so le m n ly ann oun ce in the first of your conclusion s - will mean great change
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater mar gin al isation of fish ing, since the s il ence of your programme, with regard to fish ing, is de a f ening
N ot a single line , n or a single word , ref ers to fish ing or the C F P
I am not ask ing for detail s or specific point s, but I believe that a mention was required
How could you completely i gn ore a common - I repe at ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional imp act , and which therefore affect s the economic and social cohesion of Europe ?
This is all the more seri ou s, if that is possible - as others have said - bear ing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a re vision or reform of the current common fish eri es policy, which you are leg ally required to do in 200 2
Do es the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has ann oun ced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either ?
What m ess age can we s end to the fish er men of Europe, and their fam ili es, and the fish ing industri es, both the ext ra ctive and process ing and mar ke ting industri es, and the rel ated and second ary industri es which dep end on fish ing in so many European p ort s, in so many European regions, in most cases peri p her al regions, who right ly demand that this problem be deal t with as a priority ?
You have made an exp lic it reference to the C A P for the coming years, but you have not done so for the C F P , with regard to the dou ble ad ap t ation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent excep tions - as has already been said - and in a global context , in the context of global isation
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an exp lic it reference to this problem in your rep ly today
Our parliament ary Group will t able an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive m ess age from you
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an hist or ic moment for Parliament, a five - y ear programme following the crisis of the Commission
On behalf of the Social ist Group , I would like to focus on the point of internal reform
We whole h ear ted ly support the programme as it is now la id down in a consult ative document and which is also included in the programme of V ice - P resid ent, Mr K in n ock , on behalf of the Commission
We consider it to be of u t most importance that, in terms of financial control , person n el management and bureauc ra tic short -c ut s, we can expect s w i ft l ines of policy and a more effective bureauc ra cy , for the benefit of the citizen
At the same time, we are aware that this is a m as sive programme and that, during the over h a ul in the next c ou p le of years, it will be necessary to keep the act ual results coming in , as before
M uch like in the N ether land s, where , at a given point , women w o ke up to the fact that, by refer ring to European legisl ation, they could improve their stat us in terms of social security , this is now also the case for sc ore s of other citizens
They want to see results
Dem ocra cy , transparency and cl arity always lead to result s, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is jud ged on
This is exact ly the point which Mr S w ob od a and also other Members made : fear of modern is ation, global is ation, and the individual l os ing his own sense of safety and security
This can be prevent ed if a European social mod el is dra wn up and if results are achie ved in all these conc re te areas
I would therefore strong ly adv oc ate internal reform which deli vers fa st and conc re te results at a social level . This gi ves the citizen a sense of recogn ition , here in Europe and else wh ere
B ec ause this citizen - one in five glo b ally - still has no access to e lement ary social provision s, such as e du c ation and health care
These are really the people who des erve our solidarity
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have read and re - read the Commission' s document set ting out the strategic objectives for its term in offic e
I am de light ed that it is being discuss ed in Parliament, but I also note the comprom ises and the o m ission s in it
The Commission makes only a pass ing reference to economic and social cohesion , to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union' s regional policy
And this is true even when it address es the issue of enlargement
A re redu cing the disp ar ities between level s of development and the consequ ent prom o tion of real con ver g ence objectives that we have already achie ved ?
C ertain ly not !
At the same time, it was right ly point ed out that Europe must e val u ate its role as a joint partn er with develop ing countries, and strengthen its activities design ed for f igh ting po ver ty
This document le a ves out issues which clearly should have been included
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious
It play s down one of the Trea ties ' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions ' policies and measure s. It seems to i gn ore the fact that various European regions are still consider ably less adv an ced than others
It also for get s that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right . Un less we achieve real con ver g ence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk
We should take into consideration the six th period ic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible
This report conf ir ms that where as an a ver age level of development is given a ra ting of 1 00 , the t en so -c all ed " st r ong est " regions reached an a ver age of 15 8 , and the t en so -c all ed " w e ak est " regions reached a f ig ure of a round 5 0
You may draw your own conclusion s
5 0 is exact ly the level of development of my own region , the A z ore s, one of the regions def ined in the Trea ties as u l t ra - p eri p her al
I am w a iting for the Commission' s report on the u l t ra - p eri p her al regions, which the Council decid ed should be dra wn up by De ce mber 1999
I shall fin ish by rest ating my conv ic tion that without economic and social cohesion , there will be no cohesion at all, only dis unity
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission
As intend ed by the Trea ties and the will of the people , the Commission is the d ri ving force of European con struction which is like a r ock of S is y ph us which we have to p us h back up to the su m mit again together after each r ound of enlargement . We therefore need a strong Commission but one which re lies on the support of a parliament
This House is therefore your al ly but not one which is too acc omm od ating . You must therefore list en to our opinion s, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech
Firstly, Mr President, although your two pre d ecess ors concentr ated on develop ing an internal market and establishing the single currency , it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizens hip which is at the hear t of European con struction
You must not allow your self to be dist ra ct ed by the so le issue of enlargement , how ever important this may be
You must go further , towards recon cil ing the people with Europe, in particular those people who are fall ing vic tim to economic , social and, prob ab ly, in the future , techn ological di vision s
The prom o tion of scientific development and new techn olog ies and access for all to these techn olog ies will not be provided by the market or competition . The l at ter will also not ensure the social pro x im ity and effec tiveness of the main community services of health , e du c ation, transport , communic ations, water and wh ate ver else
Y our action programme and your objectives are res erv ed, even s il ent, specifically on the sti m ul ation of public invest ment which is needed
This is also the case with the con so lid ation and finan cing of the main public and general interest services
This is an absolute priority if you are to recon ci le Europe with the people and ensure that the people ch o ose Europe rather than J ö r g Haider
Madam President, the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top prior ities
The recent di o x in sc are in B el g ium , prior to that the B S E crisis in B rit ain , and the continu ing cont ro vers y over the safety of g ene tic ally -m od if ied food s, have all contrib ut ed to under min ing consum er confidence in the safety of the food they e at
If the Commission can indeed rest ore confidence in the food produ ction ch ain it will sim ult an e ous ly rest ore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstr ate their ab ility to prot ect the rights of EU citizens
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food saf et y, public health and consum er confidence fe at ures pro min ently in the Commission' s work programme for 2000
However, I was dis app oint ed with the nature of the proposal for the establish ment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper
In its present form , what is being proposed is more like an adv is ory ag ency to the Commission rather than an independent bod y that would have decision - and law -m aking po w ers more sim ilar to those of the U S F o od and D ru g A d minist r ation, which has already established cre di bility in this particular field
F urther more, future legislation must address the mod us oper and i of the relations hip between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland
This bod y, for example, al ong side the rec ently established cross-border bod y in Ireland for food saf et y, is already doing good work
It would be a tra ged y if their efforts were to be under min ed by de fic i en ci es in EU legislation
My fear is that such de fic i en ci es in EU legislation could lead to t ur f w ar s between national and EU bod ies, who should be working together rather than against one another
That is something we must gu ard against
Madam President, the present ation by President Prodi today has necess arily been a fa ir ly broad b r us h affair
We will be look ing for the detail year by year , for example in the social action programme to be un ve il ed this year
We will also be look ing at this from the pers pe ctive of social and employment policy, and will be apply ing a number of t est s
We will be look ing at the extent to which we can create an equ il ater al policy t ri ang le comb ining economic policy, employment policy and social policy. At the mom ent, social policy is tra il ing well behind economic and employment policy
With in the employment strategy we will look for a de ep ening and broad ening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presid ency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency
With in the social di men sion we will be look ing for a de ep ening of the internal market with a social aspect
The sp ate of m erg ers, take over s and trans f ers that we are experi en cing with the de ep ening of the market means that we must act to up d ate the mat ri x of information and consult ation dire ctives that we have adopted in the past ; but we must also comp lement them with the new general framework of information and consult ation and an up d ating of the work s c ouncil directive
We also need a cod e of cor por ate con du ct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their work ers in the management of change
That is the successful way to manage change , and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place
Finally, with the em erg ence, the res ur g ence, of the xenophob ic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their u t most to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 1 3 to combat discri min ation, and Article 1 3 7 to combat exc lusion
We need to move that agenda forward with great urg ency now
The as p ir ations are fin e, President Prodi, we want those as p ir ations to be mat ch ed by action
Madam President, I hope that it is a good o men that there are still a few i 's left for me to d ot
Mr Prodi, you set great st ore in your reform efforts on introdu cing a forward - lo ok ing employment policy throughout Europe
However, for the economic sector which I represent , i.e. fish eri es, this means change
We need to b re ak away from plan n ed economy subsid ies in favour of a li beral policy which fo st ers person al responsibility
We must redu ce prot ec tive t ar i ff s in order to saf eg uard effective cap ac ity u til isation in undert aking s in the process ing industry
What it comes down to is the competi tiveness of the European economy on the world market and the exist ence of th ous and s of jobs in the process ing industry and off s h ore fish ing
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a b r an ch of the economy which is both an economic and a social fact or , which affect s not only German y but all the co ast al regions of Europe
P lu s, this b r an ch of the economy is one of the few sect ors in which Europe has fully integr ated po w ers to dec ide and act , which is why we expect to be given a right of cod ec ision here too
This has since been un an im ous ly approved
The fish eri es policy is due for review in a few months ' time, i.e. at the begin ning of the year 2000
So it is some wh at up se t ting that there is not so much as a mention of this b r an ch of the economy is this p aper
I hope that this is a mis u nder stand ing
P le ase , Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your prom ises
Madam President, many of the speak ers from the Social ist Group have already i d enti f ied key areas where there are g aps in the Commission' s statement
However, we have ac know led ged that this is an innov ative and very welcome initiative by the Commission
One area that I want to focus on , in addition to those already i d enti f i ed, is that of cultural di vers ity in Europe
The introdu ction to this statement ac know led g es under the quality of life sec tion that it is important
But there is nothing in the statement which indic ates that the Commission intend s to take any step s to deal with the issue of cultural di vers ity
If we are to ensure that we def e at the fear -m ong ers among st us - those seek ing power on the back s of an x ious citizens - then we must serious ly address the question of how we can live together and how we can dis m ant le the ne g ative st ere ot y p es that we have of each other , both within the present European Union and among those who seek to j o in us and, inde ed, among those in other part s of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe
Un less we address these issues , un less we dis m ant le these ne g ative st ere ot y p es, un less we take what is best from our various cult ures and l ang u ag es and prot ect and exp and it and ensure that we are serious about having a di ver se Europe, we will fail
Th ose who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will w in the day
I am serious ly concerned that un less the Commission recogn ises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a co hes ive Europe, we will make progress on the economic f ron t , on the employment f ron t and even on the issue of fore ign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fear ful because they will fear the un know n and they will fear those they do not understand
If we do not take step s to deal with that, we will fail u l tim ately
Thank you, Mr De R os s a
B e fore gi ving the f lo or again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have recei v ed, purs u ant to R ule 3 7 , se ven mo tions for resolution s to conclud e the debate
We l come
I would like to inform you that there is a de leg ation from K u w a it , l ed by H is E x cell ency , S he i k h S al em Al - S ab a h , V ice - P ri me Minister and D ef ence Minister , here in the official g all er y
On behalf of the House , I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament
Mr President, I should like to ra ise a point of order in relation to the activities organ ised today by the As soci ation of Parliament ary As s ist ants in support of their call for a stat ute for assist ants to be adopted as soon as possible
I understand that on 2 6 J an u ary the as soci ation w ro te to the C ol le ge of Q u a est ors reques ting per m ission to set up a t able outside the H em ic y c le today to public ise their initiative
On the same day , I understand , Mr B alf e g ave per m ission for the assist ants to go a he ad
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assist ants yesterday to make the necessary ph y s ical ar r ange ments
However, the app oint ment was can cell ed at the last min ute
Parliament has not yet indic ated why per m ission was with d ra wn
Mrs B an ot ti app ar ently prom ised to wr ite a let ter explain ing why per m ission was with d ra wn but so far no let ter has been received
C an you explain why the appro val given to the assist ants was with d ra wn at the last min ute ?
Do you agree that the assist ants have a leg iti m ate case which must be he ard ?
W ill you do every thing in your power to ensure that such last - min ute can cell ations do not happen again ?
W ill you do every thing in your power to ensure that a stat ute for assist ants is adopted as soon as possible ?
Finally, will you make sure that in the mean ti me Parliament 's rules are proper ly implemented and that assist ants are pa id , as they should be , on the basis of all the work they do for us ?
With out them we would not be able to function
Mr President, I also r ise on a point of order
A re there any rules or regulations that govern demonstr ations within the build ing of this Parliament, outside the do ors of the H em ic y c le , to ensure that M E P s are free to come into this H em ic y c le to discharge their m and ate ?
If there are such rul es, who has the responsibility for en for cing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ?
Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the stat ute for assist ant s, which we have always considered to be a priority , and inform you that - as the It al ian de leg ation of the group - in response to the inv it ation from the group lead er, Mr B ar ó n C res p o, we have forward ed the contra ct s that we d re w up with the assist ants to the Q u a est ors
I think that we need to make a t ang ible g est ure in order to get a solution to this problem under way . I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to inv ite the Members to do like wise
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a stat ute for assist ants
Y esterday when I ar ri ved in Parliament I was hand ed a document relating to a proposed demonst ration by the assist ants outside the do ors of Parliament
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approach ed me over the last six months - all ex h ib i tions and such like are f il ter ed first of all through the C om art committee of Parliament
To give a non- con t enti ous example, no comm er cial ex h ib i tions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reason s
F o llow ing a let ter I received yesterday , I immedi ately inform ed the assist ants that we would propose that they be allow ed to hold a meeting or demonstr ation, prob ably in the ne ar future and pos sib ly in the next month
But all ex h ib i tions must be carried out in a way that do not inter f ere with the order ly run ning of Parliament
I sign ed a let ter yesterday after n o on , in the meeting of the B ureau of Parliament, in which the assist ants were inform ed of this
But I am also to ld that they were inform ed ver b ally of this decision by the Committee of Ch air men of Group s last Th urs day , so they were fully aware of the decision
There is no problem with them tell ing us the way they feel , there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament 's next part -s ession
But there was some mis u nder stand ing, for they did rece ive a let ter from some b od y else that they f el t g ave them per m ission
But all ex h ib i tions are in fact look ed at first by the so -c all ed C om art committee
As you can see we have many ex h ib i tions a round Parliament, whether they be about different countries or wh ate ver
This is not an attemp t to either c ens or or go against the very real and jus tif i able principle that we should have a stat ute for assist ants
Thank you, Mrs B an ot ti
I think your inter vention may cl ar if y various points that were raised
Mr President, I want ed to point out an important matter of principle
I person ally believe that it is nothing short of sc and al ous that we hear Members of this Parliament att ack ing the demonst ration rather than look ing at the solution to the problem , which is fa ir condition s, fa ir pay and fa ir h our s
We shall now proceed to the vote . 1
V O T E
Mr President, I am spe aking on behalf of the S p anish de leg ation of the European Pe ople ' s Par t y, the de leg ation of the S p anish Pe ople ' s Par t y, with regard to Mrs T er r ó n i C us í ' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice
There have been some v ot es where we have not follow ed the guidelines of the Group of the European Pe ople ' s Par t y, and we have voted in favour of the T er r ó n i C us í resolution , which we consider on the whole to be excellent
However, we have voted against paragraph s 2 and 6 , because they seem to us to be leg ally incor rect
On the other hand, we have voted in favour of R ec ital J which, in fact, is in line with what I , as draft sp ers on of the opinion of the Committee on C itiz ens ' F reedom s, proposed to that Committee , with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 1 3
An appropriate stat ute and the right of movement and set t lement for res id ents of non- E U countries is something which the S p anish Pe ople ' s Party has been adv oc ating for some time
For sim ilar reason s, we have voted in favour of paragraph 1 4 which, with the or al amendment , deal t with certain very jus tif i able concerns about the question of subsidiarity , since political right s, not just voting in local ele ction s, but political rights in general term s, form part of the so ver e ign ty of Member States
G i ven the or al amendment , we f el t we could vote in favour and that is what we have done

 ( D A ) The D anish Social Dem ocra tic Members of the European Parliament have ch os en to vote in favour of the proposed resolution , but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas cl as h with the res erv ation D en mark has in the legal sp h ere - a res erv ation which the D anish de leg ation in the Group of the Party of European Social ists nat ur ally wishes to respect
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with ' c omm un iti s ation ' or the con so lid ation of F ort ress Europe
The supp osed progress achie ved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occ ur red in the D ub lin Con ven tions and Sch eng en Ag ree ments and a further action plan from T amp ere which all restric t the rights of immig r ant s. In terms of human right s, this is a back ward step
Europe is continu ing to ex pe l national s ar ri ving from countries regard ed as dangerous by the O ffice of the United N ations H igh Commissioner for R ef uge es. Y et some applic ant countries in central and e ast ern Europe are taking in g y p s y refuge es ex pe ll ed en m as se from B el g ium
Kosovo Al ban i ans and S er b des er ter s are being ref us ed refuge e stat u s, where as P in o ch et is c al m ly es c ap ing pro sec ution
The Europe of Sch eng en clearly find s it much e a si er to h ound the per secut ed from the s ou th than d ict ator s, even though the U N es tim ates that we will need 15 9 million immig r ants to maintain a st able population between now and the year 2 0 2 5
Europe should reg ular ise the situation of all its i l leg al immig r ants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all ele ction s. On ly then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice
M c C ar th y report (A5- 00 2 6 /2 000 )
Mr President, I would first ly like to point out that I was M ay or of B il b a o during the n ine ti es, which g ave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban p il ot projects to be subsid ised by the Commission
Our experience with that p il ot project in B il b a o l ed us to four conclusion s : first ly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from redu cing the EUR 9 00 million for the last five year period to EUR 7 00 million for this five year period , the funding of this project should be increas ed. This should be done , for example - and the Group of the G re ens / E uro pe an F ree All i ance has proposed this - by re in ves ting , in URBAN project s, that p or tion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not sp ent within the time sc al es la id down for that purp ose
Secondly, when decid ing which areas must be subsid is ed, we must concentr ate efforts on integr ated projects
D is p ar ate actions are not effective
We have to se lect loc ations by prior iti s ing those which are most imp over ish ed and need y, in accordance with the objectives set , that is to say, the social , economic , environmental and democratic management di men sion s, as well as the relations hip between them
Th ird ly, we have to bear in mind the sy n erg ies gener ated by other Community programm es, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the loc ation or region in question
Finally, we have to put our tr ust in , and support , the institutions which are clos est to the citizen s, that is, the local c ouncil s and bod ies
They have more first - h and know ledge of social need s. They have more involve ment in the problems and, further more, they know how to con ce ive projects and implement them effective ly without we igh ing them down with bureauc ra cy , and there b y achieve better results
L ast ly, in today ' s vote on our four amendment s, two have been approved and the other two reject ed
This has oblig ed us to ab st ain from the final vote , because we do not understand how we can i gn ore the environmental question when decid ing which projects must be finan ced and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can d ed ic ate, to URBAN project s, that p or tion of the Structural Funds which it has not sp ent in accordance with Community programmes
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Polic y, Transport and T our ism had an in - d ep th discussion on the URBAN initiative which produ ced many ide as
As the small est Community initiative in exist ence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was reject ed
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have help ed with p il ot project s. We should re me mber that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a t ru ly urban policy to be established
The Commission should also pay attention to co her ence between the various policies which are in place . It should make URBAN projects co her ent with future projects in budget l ines en tit led ' s ustain able urban policy '
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. P er haps this point could be develop ed in the context of re or gan isation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union fin ally has a true urban policy
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, know n as URBAN
As with all other Community initiatives , this is very positive
Europe is making its pres ence f el t at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State , which ever one it may be
URBAN is design ed to find solution s to urban dec ay , and this is something of great concern to the e ld er ly and therefore of great concern to the P ension ers ' Party
There can be no wor se situation than that of an e ld er ly person living in a c ity
I hope that this Community initiative will help s erve as an example on how to resol ve the problems fa ced by the e ld er ly in c ities

 ( D A ) The Le ft ' s five Members of the European Parliament have ch os en to support LEADER + , the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG , but not URBAN
At a forth coming review of these programm es, it o u ght to be established that the EU ' s efforts are to be concentr ated upon cross-border tas ks and ad ap ted to the possible enlargement of the EU

 ( D A ) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social reg ener ation of c ities and ne igh bour ho od s in crisis and design ed to promote sustainable development ( U RBAN )
B as ic ally, we are opp osed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be us ed, we have conf ined ourselves to assess ing the cont ents and think , in general , that the proposal for reg ener ating ne igh bour ho od s in crisis contain s some sen sible obs erv ations, as well as some good sugg es tions and criteria for the rele vant projects
This report contain s general points on what is refer red to as the urban reg ener ation strategy for to wn cent res and ne igh bour ho od s affect ed by the crisis in the capital ist economy and its consequ en ces, i.e. increasing unemployment , exc lusion and de lin qu ency
It under l ines the fact that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, an urban policy must be implemented which does not le ave out the main vic ti ms of the economic crisis , namely the une mploy ed, immig r ant s, refuge es, women and the so cially exc lud ed
However, nothing is said about the caus es of this crisis and those responsible for it
At best this report simply correct s certain aspect s and effects of the crisis . Y et only sc and al ous ly limited resources are available for this work
As the report itself indic ates , the funds alloc ated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000 - 2 00 6 period are appro x im ately 3 0% less than those in the previous period , which were already low , at EUR 9 00 million . A d d ed to this is the fact that only about f i ft y projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is p at he tic when prac tic ally all European c ity dist ric t s, both sub ur ban and inn er c ity , are affect ed
This is why we will vote individ ually in favour of the specific measures plan n ed to help certain social c ateg or ies which are most dis ad vant aged but will ab st ain on the report itself in order to d en oun ce the fact that in the main it cons ists of p ious h op es finan ced on the ch e ap
- ( F R ) Mrs M c C ar th y, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the URBAN Community In iti ative is being continu ed as this aim s to support the social and economic con ver sion of c ities and ne igh bour ho od s in crisis , all with a view to achie ving sustainable urban development
With some 8 0% of the population of Europe living in an urban area , c ities are at the fore f ron t of economic , social and cultural change in Europe
At the same time, the social and economic problems fa cing European soci ety are more pr on oun ced in urban areas
M an y European c ities are di vid ed into ne igh bour ho od s ch ar ac ter ised by high - ad d ed - val ue activities and high -in come res id ents and other dist ric ts ch ar ac ter ised by low inc om es, high unemployment , sub stand ard and over c row d ed h ous ing and high level s of wel f are dep end ency
The concentr ation of economic and social problems in certain urban areas call s for t ar get ed inter vention taking full account of the comple x ity of the problems involved
This is why the European Parliament successful ly call ed for the URBAN Community In iti ative or C I P to be extend ed during the reform of the Structural Funds
The success of URBAN during the 199 4 - 1999 programm ing period is ind is p ut able
The results are clear in terms of the improve ment of the quality of life in the t ar get areas
This C I P has encoura ged the development of best practice mod els in the economic , social and environmental sect ors
It has also had the dis tin ction of strengthen ing the role of local author ities, the non- governmental sector and local commun ities and of supp or ting new partnership approach es to urban reg ener ation
The new initiative will continue to purs ue these go als by re in for cing them , while particularly prom oting equal opportunities between m en and women and int e gra ting so cially mar gin al ised and dis ad vant aged groups
We can therefore welcome its adop tion
We must , however, ad mit that in financial terms we cannot pro c la im a v ict ory ! The total appropri ation alloc ated is not up to the challenge
The amount for the 199 4 - 1999 period was EUR 9 00 million and will be EUR 7 00 million for the 2000 - 2 00 6 period . This represent s a d ro p of 3 0% !
This redu ction in funding has l ed to a redu ction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative
The ch os en th res ho ld of 5 0 projects seems too low
It needs to be increased to ref lect regional and local fact ors wh il st maintain ing financial a wards to the Member States
In view of this concentr ation on a limited number of project s, the public ation and dis se mination of the results of the new URBAN Community In iti ative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a mul ti p li er effect
The M c C ar th y report on the URBAN Community In iti ative gi ves us an opportunity to ref lect on the appropri at en ess of Community inter vention in urban matters
The situation of certain urban areas is al arm ing, with the social dist ress taking the form of unemployment , mis er y and crime
D ru g deal ing in particular f ue l s in sec urity and de lin qu ency
F ac ed with these social chall eng es, the effec tiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt
S ub sid i arity should make us real ise that the state , ex erc ising its govern ing function s, and local authorities are the bod ies most able to inter ven e appropriate ly. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help dis ad vant aged people
Al though we welcome the deter mination to create a system of exch ang es between successful enter p ris es, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be deal t with in the same way
The URBAN Community In iti ative is help ing to achieve the European Union' s des ire to commun iti se urban policy
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentr ate its financial efforts on pre - e x isting European policies
C lear ly some people are prof iting from the opportunity to ind ul ge in another budget b id d ing ra ce which is particularly mis tim ed when the con ver g ence criteria for E M U are imp os ing a very str ict s li m m ing reg ime on the national budget s
Mrs M c C ar th y is therefore sugg es ting an increase in the funds alloc ated to URBAN and the prom o tion of this Community initiative through a cost ly communication c amp a ign ext o ll ing the benefit s of a f eder al Europe
We should re me mber that the effec tiveness of exp end it ure is not measure d by the vol u me of funding alloc ated to the project
In fact, the bene fic i ar ies of too many and too high subsid ies will event ually just take these for grant ed
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility
Finally, the report specifically high light s actions in favour of e th n ic or soci ological min or ities
We can only con d em n a policy on min or ities which is in e v it ably dangerous for social cohesion
On one hand, this policy encoura g es the integration of immig r ants where it should favour their as si m il ation into the culture of the ho st country . This would prevent the development of e th n ic g h et t os which are nothing more than urban po w der k eg s
On the other hand, it man ip ul ates the principle of positive discri min ation. This is a politic ally correct f an cy which can be just as harm ful , as sh own by the U S pre ced ent
For all these reason s, the French de leg ation of the U E N Group could not appro ve the M c C ar th y report
D ec our ri è re report (A5- 00 2 8 /2 000 )
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hear ts
Li ke many of my colleagues , I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to saf eg uard this initiative
As I live in the S ar re - L or - L u x S ud region of B el g ium , I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being creat ed. They are where we live the European experience on a d a ily basis and where the people make European con struction come a li ve
These projects must therefore be proper ly taken into account and must integr ate sustainable development
Wh y am I stress ing this point ?
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being sub mitted are still too often dam ag ing to the environment due to the way they are sub mitted
For example, to accept new road s is to accept new po ll ution within the European Union. This goes tot ally against the policies which we are propos ing to fight gre en h ouse g as em ission s, for example
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental p ill ar of the EU ' s policy is integr ated into the projects sub mitted and that the go al of redu cing C O 2 for example for ms an experi ment al add ed value in the projects proposed
I am particularly think ing in this respect of certain inf ra st ruct ures which are under con struction
We know that some Member States are still w a ver ing, for example, between ra il and road for r out es through v ul ner able areas such as the P y r ene es, as in the As pe val le y
However, I am also think ing of my own region where my government is still deb ating whether to r out e the ra il way or to build a second m ot or way , the A 3 2
In this respect too , I would ask the Commission to be particularly att en tive about ens uring that there is real cohesion between the various polic ies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being sub mitted
Mr President, I voted for the D ec our ri è re report on the Community initiative INTERREG , main ly because of the rep ly Commissioner B arn i er g ave to some Members who to ok the f lo or and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime f ron ti ers
I voted for it, not just because I was b or n in a co ast al to wn , G en o a, but above all because the f ron ti ers of regions border ed by the se a are f ron ti ers too
These f ron ti ers st ret ch as far as A f ric an states and the M id d le East : we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop co ast al regions in every part of Europe
As an M E P from a border region , I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experi en ced in the past by maritime and l and l ock ed border regions which have been c ut off economic ally, so cially and cult ur ally
D ue to the exist ence of these border s, they have become peri p her al areas within the countries to which they be l ong . This has too often l ed the national authorities to ne g lect these regions in national policy
This is why the INTERREG Community In iti ative was la un ch ed in 199 0
This programme was design ed to encoura ge cross-b ord er, trans n ational and inter reg ional cooperation and to promote bal an ced development of the Community ter rit ory in order to en h ance economic and social cohesion in the Union
INTERREG s er ves princip ally to fund Community sch em es to develop S M E s, e du c ation and tra in ing, cultural exch ang es, action to combat health problem s, the protection and improve ment of the environment , energ y, transport and te le c omm un ic ations net wor ks
I must stress that inter reg ional cooperation significant ly encoura g es the involve ment of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration
M ore active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be prom ot ed, bear ing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited cap ac ity for cooperation because of the different legal frame wor ks and different level s of development on either s ide of the border
In cross-border cooper ation, greater emphas is must be pla ced on impro ving the conditions for the economic activ ity of the small and medium -si zed undert aking s which are the job creat ors
In the same respect , given that structural unemployment is responsible for 5 0% of all unemployment , the INTERREG funds made available must be su fficient to supp lement national measures prom oting employment
Ob st ac les too often caus ed by dou ble tax ation and social protection are pre ven ting , b ra k ing or h in der ing cross-border mo bility
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solution s to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of work ers which is in a b ad way in my region !
INTERREG resources must also contrib ute to the development of a European research area
Finally, and in particular , expect ations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small to wn s not elig ible for Objective 2 funding are h op ing to ob tain comp ens ation through INTERREG !
The chall eng es are therefore im men se . The integration of the border regions will be an essential e lement in the development of a future European regional development policy !
I hope everyone , like Mr D ec our ri è re , wh om I congratulate , will real ise this !
- ( F R ) The INTERREG Community In iti ative is just one e lement of an i ll -f ated European regional policy
This app ar ently gener ous policy, offic i ally intend ed to help problem regions, is a fo ol ' s b ar g ain for French tax p ay ers. France contrib utes 1 7 % of the European budget yet will rece ive only 8 % of the regional Structural Funds
B et ween 199 4 and 1999 , our regions ann ually received an a ver age of F F 15 . 4 b illion but will rece ive only F F 1 4 . 7 b illion between 2000 and 200 6
My region of N ord - P as - de - C al a is will be particularly affect ed with French H ain a ut l os ing the aid pa id to Objective 1 regions
This l os s is un j us tif ied in a region whose main activities have been r u ined by free - t ra de Europe
The European regional policy also re in for ces the central ism of Brus sels with which the regional authorities are inv ited to negoti ate direct ly on the use of the Structural Funds
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weak er than the n ation states , will e a si ly sub mit to Brus sels
The INTERREG initiative , la un ch ed in 199 0 to prep are the border regions for a Europe without b ord ers and therefore without n ations, sit s com fort ably within this ph il os oph y
However, Mr D ec our ri è re does show some common sense by d en oun cing the fail ings of the Brus sels techn ocrat s. These fail ings will result in particular in the l ate implementation of INTERREG II I and therefore in financial l os s es for the regions in rece ip t of aid
We also agree with the rapporteur about ask ing for more attention to be pa id to small and medium -si zed undert aking s and, of course, about ref us ing to use outside service provid ers. These are the proced ures which caus ed the cor ru p tion sc and al in the previous Commission
However, these is ol ated ele ments which make sense and for which we v ot ed, in no way rem ed y the Euro f eder al ist ph il os oph y which ch ar ac ter ises the Community initiatives , particularly INTERREG
This is why the N ational Fr on t voted against the report
The European Parliament has deli ver ed an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community In iti ative concerning cross-b ord er, trans n ational and inter reg ional cooperation
I want to def end an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the At l an tic Ar c but rather the need to integr ate the principle of maritime b ord ers into strand A on cross-border cooperation
In the Commission guidel in es, few maritime areas are elig ible for INTERREG II I A
The amendments to the D ec our ri è re report aim to make INTERREG more maritime - or ient ed
This is an important development which must be support ed as it is the future of the EU which is at st ake
I am aware of the Commission' s re lu ct ance on this subject as it ann oun ced during the sy mp o si um on the present ation of INTERREG II I last No ve mber
However, I must point out that pre ven ting the recogn ition of maritime b ord ers amount s to d en ying the exist ence of an area which has great potential for projects and innov ation
One example of this is the ' C el tic ' area which en com p ass es the terr itor ies of Br itt an y in Fr ance, C or n w all and De v on in the United K ing d om and C or k and W ater f ord in Ireland . This is an area whose loc ally -b ased economy is ch ar ac ter ised by dep end ence on the fish ing industry and the importance of the ag ri -f o od st u ff s sector
It also has excellent cultural and rel ational link s, through tw in ning s for example . INTERREG II I , strand A , would allow the regions in this area to adv ance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium -si zed undert aking s and to promote research and technical development through know ledge trans fer
The European Commission should therefore be able to particip ate in the con struction of p ort and a ir port inf ra st ruct ure to provide link s between regions
This policy would have important economic consequ ences for the fish ing industry in Br itt an y in that c at ch es could be un lo ad ed at I r ish adv ance bas es in order to then be transport ed to the B ret on ag ri -f o od st u ff s industry
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would fin ally allow the w es tern peri p her y to be recogn ised as a un i q ue and important economic area which is conf ron ted by the ' con tin ent al isation ' of the European Union
This would show respect for these peri p her al areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the e ast
The maritime world has great potential
We therefore must not le ave it out of innov ative and p il ot Community programmes which will allow the new g e o graph ical and economic m ap of Europe to be def ined
