80	School Attendance :  Information for Parents
81	Introduction
82	If you are a parent of  ( or are responsible for )  a child aged between 5 and 16 who is registered at school ,  this information explains your responsibilities for making sure he or she attends school regularly .
83	The Law
84	By law ,  all children of compulsory school age  ( between 5 and 16 )  must get a proper full - time education .
85	You are responsible for making sure this happens ,  either by registering the child at a school or by making other arrangements which provide an effective education .
86	Why must my child go to school regularly ?
87	Having a good education will help to give your child the best possible start in life .
88	If your child does not attend school regularly ,  he or she will not be able to keep up with the work .
89	So children who have not attended their school regularly have less chance of getting a good job .
90	ï»¿Modern markets :  confident consumers
91	a summary of the government's consumer white paper
92	A fair deal and prosperity go hand in hand .
93	Confident consumers ,  making informed decisions in modern and competitive markets ,  promote the development of innovative and good value products .
94	And better performance in business in turn benefits consumers .
95	The opening up of global markets and the spread of electronic commerce bring opportunities and challenges for consumers and for business .
96	In its White Paper ,  modern markets :  confident consumers ,  the Government has set a new agenda .
97	to promote open and competitive markets
98	to avoid burdening those businesses with unnecessary regulation
99	to protect the public from serious trading malpractice and unsafe products .
100	The White Paper will benefit all consumers but the Government will focus in particular on the needs of those with less developed consumer skills ,  those who are socially excluded and those on low incomes who can least afford to make a bad purchase .
101	Open and competitive markets
102	Open and competitive markets are the best guarantee of a good deal for consumers .
103	They encourage innovation and ensure competitive prices .
104	The Government is putting in place a framework that fosters free and fair competition ,  but is tough on those who seek to damage the competitive process .
105	The Government is also encouraging the competition authorities to be more proactive .
106	To this end ,  the Government is launching an annual study to investigate whether prices are higher in the UK than in the US ,  France and Germany .
107	The competition authorities will then look at whether any discrepancies are caused by anti - competitive behaviour .
108	Knowledgeable and demanding consumers
109	To make informed choices ,  consumers need reliable information on price ,  quality and the safety of products .
110	The Government will take steps to ensure that consumers have access to accurate ,  comprehensive and comprehensible information .
111	better information on prices
112	Goods on sale in shops will be clearly priced .
113	And it will be easier to compare the price of goods in different quantities .
114	truthful advertising and claims
115	The Government proposes to change the law to introduce tougher controls on misdescriptions of services .
116	providing timely information
117	Consumers will be better informed about their rights when buying by mail order ,  telephone or the Internet ,  and given a guaranteed level of prior information about the contract .
118	building knowledge and skills
119	Consumer education is a top priority .
120	The Government is working with a wide range of groups to develop training packages for adults and schoolchildren .
121	Promoting customer service

123	The Government wants to encourage good customer service in a number of ways .
124	developing effective codes of practice
125	Working with business ,  consumer groups and local authorities ,  the Government has drawn up core principles for effective codes of practice .
126	The Government also proposes to give the Office of Fair Trading  ( OFT )  powers to approve and publicise codes which meet these principles .
127	promoting good practice
128	The Government will help develop customer satisfaction indices ,  and encourage their inclusion in existing and future benchmarking schemes .
129	more help for business

200	School Attendance :  Information for Parents
201	Introduction
202	If you are a parent of  ( or are responsible for )  a child aged between 5 and 16 who is registered at school ,  this information explains your responsibilities for making sure he or she attends school regularly .
203	The Law
204	By law ,  all children of compulsory school age  ( between 5 and 16 )  must get a proper full - time education .
205	You are responsible for making sure this happens ,  either by registering the child at a school or by making other arrangements which provide an effective education .
206	If your child is registered as a pupil at a particular school ,  that school must give permission for your child to be absent .
207	If your child does not go to the school at which he or she is registered ,  the relevant education authority can take legal action against you .
208	Why must my child go to school regularly ?
209	Having a good education will help to give your child the best possible start in life .
210	If your child does not attend school regularly ,  he or she will not be able to keep up with the work .
211	Employers will want to be sure that the people they are thinking of taking on are reliable .
212	So children who have not attended their school regularly have less chance of getting a good job .
213	Young people who are off school for no good reason are at risk of becoming victims of crime or abuse .
214	They may also be drawn into anti - social or criminal behaviour .
215	What can I do to help ?
216	Make sure that your child goes to school regularly ,  arrives on time and keeps to the school's rules on going to all lessons .
217	Start these good habits at an early age ,  while your child is in primary school .
218	If your child starts missing school ,  help the school to put things right .
219	Make sure your child understands that you do not approve of him or her missing school .
220	If your child is ill ,  contact the school on the first day of your child's illness .
221	Staff will be concerned if they do not hear anything .
222	If your child is ever off school ,  you must tell the school why .
223	Do this by following the arrangements made by the school .
224	If you want permission for your child to miss school for example because of a special occasion such as a wedding ,  you should ask for permission well in advance and give full details .
225	Do not expect the school to agree to shopping trips during school hours .
226	Take an interest in your child's school work .
227	Support the school in its efforts to control bad behaviour .
228	Family holidays during term time
229	Wherever possible ,  you should take your holidays during school holidays .
230	Avoid taking your child on holiday at times when he or she should be taking exams or tests .
231	You should not expect your child's school to agree to a family holiday during term time .
232	The school will carefully consider your request and they may take your child's attendance record into account .
233	Schools will not agree to your child missing more than a total of ten school days for family holidays in any one school year ,  unless there is a very good reason .
234	If your child is off school for more than ten days ,  the school may set work for him or her to do while you are away .
235	The role of the Local Education Authority
236	Local education authorities  ( LEAs )  are responsible ,  by law ,  for making sure that registered pupils of compulsory school age attend their school regularly .
237	Most LEAs employ education welfare officers  ( also called education social workers )  to monitor school attendance and to help parents meet their responsibilities .
238	Education welfare officers work closely with schools .
239	If your child is not attending school regularly ,  an education welfare officer may visit you .
240	For your child's sake you should co - operate with the education welfare officer to make sure your child overcomes his or her attendance problems and gets a proper education .
241	If you do not do everything you can to co - operate with the education welfare officer and school ,  the LEA may have no choice but to get an education supervision order .
242	This means that the court appoints a supervisor to help and give advice to you and your child .
243	The LEA can also prosecute you in a magistrates court .
244	This could result in you and your partner being fined up to  Â£1000 for each child who is not going to school .
245	If you need more information or help ,  please contact your local school or your Local Education Authority

247	Home - School Agreements
248	What every parent should know
249	In this document ,  we refer to 'your child' .
250	In fact ,  it's aimed at anyone who is the carer of a child aged 5 to 16 and whose name appears on the admission register as a 'parent' at his or her school .
251	From September 1999 ,  all schools will have to have a written 'home - school agreement' ,  drawn up in consultation with you .
252	This will be for all pupils and parents ,  not just new pupils .
253	This document explains the purpose of these agreements ,  what they will cover and how you can get involved in decisions about the agreement introduced by your child's school .
254	There are many ways you can help your child in school .
255	By law you are responsible for making sure he or she goes to school regularly ,  and on time .
256	But you can also help by supporting the school's rules ,  and its arrangements for homework .
257	Make sure your child knows that you support the school's policies .
258	Ask your child's teachers how you can help your child at school .
259	Tell them about anything which might affect your child's work at school and talk to them if you are worried about your child's progress .
260	Make sure the school knows that you want to be told as soon as any problems arise which involve your child .
261	Let them know about anything else you would like them to tell you .
262	What is a home - school agreement ?
263	A home - school agreement will explain the aims and values of your child's school .
264	It will spell out the responsibilities of the school and your responsibilities ,  and what the school expects of their pupils .
265	Why are home - school agreements important ?
266	Children achieve more when schools and parents work together .
267	Home - school agreements will help you to work with your child's school .
268	Your support and encouragement are very important if your child is to make the most of school .
269	Will all schools have these agreements ?
270	All state schools will have a written home - school agreement .
271	When will they be introduced ?
272	Schools will introduce these agreements from September 1999 .
273	But ,  before then ,  your child's school will ask for your views on what their home - school agreement should say .
274	What areas should the agreement include in ?
275	Each school will have its own home - school agreement .
276	You and your child's school should decide together what your agreement should say .
277	The standard of education the school will provide
278	This might say something about the standard of attainment the school is aiming for .
279	For example ,  that children have the right to a broad and balanced curriculum .
280	And how they must meet the needs of all children .
281	Schools must draw up targets for National Curriculum assessments ,  GCSEs and vocational qualifications .
282	Schools have to identify and support children with special educational needs .
283	They can set extra targets to measure the progress of these children .
284	The agreement might draw attention to these .
285	The 'ethos' of the school
286	The agreement might refer to the school's particular character and spirit  .
287	For example ,  it might say how this is put across through the attitude of pupils and staff .
288	It might also say how the school ethos is reflected in the way pupils relate to each other ,  how pupils relate to staff ,  and how the school relates to the community it serves .
289	As part of this section ,  the agreement could refer to the school's aims for pupils' spiritual ,  moral ,  cultural and social development .
290	Regular attendance on time
291	It is important for your child's future that he makes the most of his time at school .
292	This means going regularly and turning up on time ,  qualities valued by employers .
293	Home - school agreements should remind you of this .
294	If you are a parent or carer ,  did you know the following ?
295	By law you are responsible for making sure that your children are educated between the ages of 5 and 16 .
296	If your child is registered at a school ,  he or she must go to school on time every day during term - time ,  unless there is a good reason  ( such as illness )  .
297	If they do not go to school regularly ,  you may be fined .
298	It is your responsibility to tell the school if your child cannot go .
299	If attendance problems do develop ,  the school will expect you to help their staff and the education welfare service to solve the problems .
300	You do not have a right to take children on holiday in term - time .
301	The school must agree this beforehand .
302	Discipline and behaviour
303	You have a very important role in encouraging your child to behave well ,  and your influence is critical in shaping your child's attitude and behaviour .
304	Good behaviour and discipline in school pupils should come from a partnership between home and school .
305	The home - school agreement should say that the pupil will be expected to keep to the school's rules ,  and that you will support the school in maintaining good behaviour and discipline .
306	Homework
307	Doing homework helps children to develop important skills ,  in particular those of independent learning .
308	The Government recommends regular homework for all children from year 1 upwards .
309	Young children should start by reading or sharing a book with you for short periods of time .
310	We have asked all schools to draw up a written statement of their policy on homework ,  consulting parents .
311	To help them do this we have given them guidelines on how much homework children of different ages should do .
312	The amount of homework recommended in the guidelines ,  in broad terms ,  is shown below .
313	Primary
314	Years 1 and 2
315	1 hour a week
316	( reading ,  spelling ,  other literacy work and number work )
317	Years 3 and 4
318	1 1 / 2 hours a week
319	( literacy and numeracy as for Years 1 and 2 and with occasional assignments in other subjects )
320	Years 5 and 6
321	30 minutes a day
322	( regular weekly schedule with continued emphasis on literacy and numeracy but also ranging widely over the curriculum )
323	Secondary
324	Years 7 and 8
325	45 to 90 minutes a day
326	Year 9
327	1 to 2 hours a day
328	Years 10 and 11
329	1 1 / 2 to 2 1 / 2 hours a day
330	The guidelines say that homework should be properly planned and organised so that :
331	children are not expected to do too much on one day and not enough on another ;
332	the tasks they are set are realistic within the time available ;
333	tasks are clearly related to the work children are doing in school and are not too difficult or too easy ;
334	children are given feedback on their homework ;  and
335	where possible older children can ,  if they want to ,  do their homework at places other than home ,  for example after school at a homework club ,  or at a local study support centre .
336	We have asked schools to consult you about homework and to explain what is expected of pupils ,  you and the school in homework statements .
337	The home - school agreement may just say that you are expected to support the school's homework policy without repeating what it says .
338	If you have not seen the school's policy ,  ask for a copy .
339	The agreement may also tell you the school will consult you about any changes to homework arrangements .
340	The information schools and parents will give to one another
341	Good communication between the school and the home is essential .
342	For example ,  you should know when to expect a written report on your child's progress .
343	It is also important to make sure you tell the school about any issues that might affect your child's work or behaviour .
344	How will I be involved ?
345	By law ,  the school's governors must consult all registered parents of pupils aged 5 to 16 years before introducing a home - school agreement or changing an existing one .
346	Schools will have different ways of consulting you .
347	Ask your child's school how they will consult you .
348	What do I need to think about when giving the school my views ?
349	You might want to think about :
350	what you expect from the school ;
351	what should the school expect from you ,  and from your child ;
352	what the school tells you and what you need to know ;
353	what can the school do to help you help your child ;  and
354	whether you would like to be more involved in what happens at the school .
355	Will I have to sign the agreement ?
356	The school will ask you to sign the agreement to show that you understand and accept it .
357	They might also ask your child to sign if he or she is old enough to understand it .
358	What happens if I ,  or my child ,  break the agreement ?
359	If you ,  or your child ,  break the agreement ,  the headteacher may want to discuss the matter with you .
360	The school should not discipline or exclude your child simply because you ,  or your child ,  have broken the agreement .
361	However ,  if your child breaks the agreement by seriously breaking school discipline ,  he or she may be disciplined or excluded .
362	If you feel the school is not keeping to their side of the agreement ,  you should speak to the headteacher or the governing body .
363	National Year of Reading  -  A little reading goes a long way
364	As part of the National Year of Reading which started on 16 September 1998 ,  parents are being encouraged to help their children enjoy reading and writing and to support the literacy work of schools and teachers .
365	You may have seen the TV advertisements featuring children reading a wide range of material in different places ,  from shopping lists in supermarkets to books on buses or trains .
366	We have produced a leaflet 'A little reading goes a long way' to go with the advertisements .
367	It gives simple step - by - step advice to help parents and carers discover the joys of reading and writing with their children .
368	And finally .  .  .
369	It is important that you have your say .
370	Make sure that the agreement sets out clearly what the school will do for your child and how you can help .
371	If A Blood Sample Is Being Taken
372	We are measuring the spread of HIV infection  ( the virus which causes AIDs )  and some other infectious diseases .
373	We are doing this by testing the blood from some patients ,  including babies .
374	If a blood sample is being taken ,  unless you object ,  a small leftover portion may be tested separately to provide information about infectious diseases including HIV .
375	No extra blood will be taken .
376	This sample will not have a name on it and if it is tested ,  it will be impossible to trace back to you or to let you know the result .
377	Testing leftover blood will not affect the care or treatment given nor will it have any effect on your job or insurance .
378	We hope you will help .
379	If you have any questions ,  or object to leftover blood being used for this purpose the doctor ,  nurse ,  midwife or health advisor will be happy to speak to you in confidence .
380	Your wishes will be respected .
381	If you are worried about HIV or any other infectious disease and want to have a personal test so that you can know the result ,  please ask your clinic doctor or nurse ,  or your GP ,  or go to your local genito - urinary medicine  (  GUM  )  clinic .
382	Clinics are listed in telephone directories .
383	If you have any questions about HIV and AIDS or would like to talk to a trained advisor you can call the National AIDS Helpline on 0800 - 567 - 123 .
384	The helpline operates 24 hours a day .
385	All calls are free of charge from anywhere in the UK .

387	BE BREAST AWARE
388	What is Breast Awareness ?
389	Breast awareness is a part of general body awareness .
390	It is a process of getting to know your own breasts and becoming familiar with their appearance .
391	Learning how your breasts feel at different times will help you to know what is normal for you .
392	You can become familiar with your breast tissue by looking and feeling  -  in any way that is best for you  ( eg in the bath ,  shower ,  when dressing )  .
393	Take care of your own well - being
394	The Normal Breast
395	Before the menopause normal breasts feel different at different times of the month .
396	The milk - producing tissue in the breasts becomes active in the days before a period starts .
397	In some women ,  the breasts at this time feel tender and lumpy ,  especially near the armpits .
398	After a hysterectomy the breasts usually show the same monthly differences until the time when your periods would have stopped .
399	After the menopause activity in the milk - producing tissue stops .
400	Normal breasts feel soft ,  less firm and not lumpy .
401	Know what is normal for you
402	Changes to Look out for
403	Appearance .
404	Any change in the outline or shape of the breast ,  especially those caused by arm movements ,  or by lifting the breasts .
405	Any puckering or dimpling of the skin .
406	Feelings .
407	Discomfort or pain in one breast that is different from normal ,  particularly if new and persistent .
408	Lumps .
409	Any lumps ,  thickening or bumpy areas in one breast or armpit which seem to be different from the same part of the other breast and armpit .
410	This is very important if new .
411	Nipple change .
412	Nipple discharge ,  new for you and not milky .
413	Bleeding or moist reddish areas which don't heal easily .
414	Any change in nipple position  -  pulled in or pointing differently .
415	A nipple rash on or around the nipple .
416	Know what to look and feel for
417	What to Do if You Find a Change
418	There can be many reasons for changes in the breast .
419	Most of them are harmless but all of them need to be checked as there is a small chance they could be the first sign of cancer .
420	If you are aware of any change in your breast from what is normal for you ,  tell your doctor without delay .
421	Remember ,  you are not wasting anyoneâs time .
422	If there is a cancer present ,  the sooner it is reported ,  the more simple treatment is likely to be .
423	This offers greater prospects of benefit in terms of quality of life .
424	Breast cancer is very rare in women under the age of 40 .
425	The likelihood of developing breast cancer increases with age .
426	Report any changes without delay
427	Breast Screening
428	If you are aged 50 and over it is strongly recommended that you take advantage of the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme which offers three - yearly mammography .
429	This is an X - ray procedure which can detect breast changes at a very early stage .
430	For more information about the Breast Screening Programme ask your doctor .
431	Routine X - ray breast screening is not available for women under 50 as it has not been shown to be of benefit .
432	If you have any cause for concern about your breasts tell your doctor .
433	Breast Awareness Five - point Code
434	Know what is normal for you .
435	Look and feel .
436	Know what changes to look for .
437	Report any changes without delay .
438	Attend for breast screening if aged 50 or over .
439	Reducing the Risk of Cot Death
440	The Department of Health
441	Cot death ,  also known as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ,  usually affects babies between one and five months .
442	It happens while they're asleep and is always sudden and unexpected .
443	Thankfully ,  it is comparatively rare .
444	Because no one yet knows why Cot Death happens ,  there's no sure way to prevent it .
445	Studies have shown that by taking a few simple precautions ,  you can reduce the risk .
446	The information in this leaflet is for everyone who looks after a baby  -  -  -  not just parents but other members of the family and other carers such as childminders and baby - sitters .
447	Why not keep this leaflet next to where your baby sleeps so everyone knows what to do .
448	Sleeping Position
449	Recent research shows that Cot Death is more common in babies who go to sleep on their tummies .
450	By making sure your baby goes to sleep in the right position you can reduce the risk of Cot Death .
451	Babies should be laid down to sleep :
452	on their backs or ;
453	on their sides ,  with the lower arm forward to stop them rolling over .
454	Don't be worried that babies might be sick and choke if laid on their backs .
455	There is no evidence that this happens .
456	Some babies who require special care or who have particular medical problems need to be nursed on their tummies .
457	Your doctor ,  nurse or midwife will explain why .
458	If in doubt talk it over with them .
459	For babies who have been sleeping on their tummies ,  try them on their backs or sides .
460	But they may not like the change and find it difficult to settle .
461	If this happens then it is probably wise not to upset them by insisting on the new position .
462	If you are at all worried then speak to your health visitor or doctor .
463	The right sleeping position is only important until babies are able to roll themselves over in their sleep .
464	Once they can do this it is safe to let them take whichever position they prefer .
465	Temperature
466	Babies should be kept warm ,  but they must not be allowed to get too warm .
467	Keep the temperature in your baby's room so that you feel comfortable in it .
468	Use lightweight blankets which you can add to or take way according to the room temperature .
469	Do not use a duvet or baby nest which can be too warm and can easily cover a baby's head .
470	Smoke - Free
471	Create a smoke - free zone for your baby .
472	Do not smoke anywhere near the baby .
473	Better still do not smoke at all .
474	If your baby seems unwell seek medical advice early and quickly .
475	Research continues into the causes of Cot Dearth .
476	Remember it is comparatively rare ,  so do not let the fear of Cot Death spoil the first months with your baby .
477	Discharge From Hospital
478	Since April 1993 there have been changes in the way social care is financed and provided .
479	Money has been previously been given by the Department of Social Security to pay for care in residential homes .
480	It has been transferred to the City Council's Social Services Department who are now responsible for organising all care .
481	They will do this both by providing some services themselves and by buying in care from a variety of private ad voluntary providers .
482	This will give more choice and flexibility to users and the people who care for them .
483	One of the Major aims of the changes is to make sure that help goes to those people who need it most ,  and that people get the services they want .
484	Who Will Get the Help
485	People who are due to be discharged from hospital but who still require intensive support either on a long - term basis or while they recover from a serious illness for example ,  a stroke or a major operation .
486	How to Get Help
487	Your nurse or hospital doctor will contact the Social Services Department to arrange for your needs to be assessed .
488	Someone will come to see you in hospital to find out more about you and what you would like to see happen .
489	They will also talk to people who provide care for you :   hospital staff ,  your family and your friends ,  and your GP .
490	If you are not a Manchester resident but are in hospital in the city ,  Manchester Social Services Department will make arrangements for you to be assessed .
491	( More details about the Assessment Process are in the leaflet How To Get Help From Social Services )
492	Planning Your Care
493	Wherever possible your need should be met by providing a package of care in your own home or community .
494	This could include help from the health and social services ,  but also from family and friends and voluntary groups .
495	Sometimes however it may be best to provide care in a residential or nursing home .
496	Whatever is decided the  " care plan "  that is arranged for you will only be with your full agreement .
497	The Social Services Department and the Manchester Health Authorities have made an agreement ensuring that ,  as far as possible ,  discharge from hospital should be planned effectively .
498	You should not be in hospital any longer than is medically necessary nor be sent home without proper arrangements being made .
499	Your GP will be contacted on the day of your discharge or before .
500	What It Will Cost
501	If you want and need to go into a residential home you will be asked details of your income ,  savings and property as part of your assessment .
502	If you have less than 3 , 000 pound you will not have to pay anything except any income support or attendance allowance you can claim which will go towards the costs .
503	You will be able to keep a sum for your personal expenses .
504	If you have between 3 , 000 pound and 8 , 000 pound there is a sliding scale of charges .
505	More information
506	If you require more information contact your Ward Nurse who will be able to help .
507	Food Law Inspections and your business
508	Who will inspect your business ?
509	Environmental health officers and trading standards officers have the right to enter and inspect food premises at all reasonable hours .
510	They do not have to make an appointment and they will usually come without notice .
511	They carry out routine inspections and may also visit as a result of a complaint .
512	How often routine inspections happen depends on the potential risk posed by the type of business and its previous record .
513	Some premises may be inspected at least every six months ,  others much less often .
514	Inspectors will look at the way you operate your business to identify potential hazards and to make sure it complies with the law .
515	They will discuss any problems with you and advise on possible solutions .
516	They also have powers which they can use when they think it is necessary to protect the public .
517	What are you entitled to expect from the inspectors ?
518	A courteous manner ;
519	To be shown identification ;
520	Feedback from any inspection ,  such as information about hazards which have been identified and Guidance on how they could be avoided ;
521	A clear distinction between what the inspector is recommending you do because it is good practice and what you must do to comply with the law ;
522	To be given the reasons in writing for any action you are asked to take ;
523	Where there is an apparent breach of law ,  a statement of what that law is ;
524	Reasonable time to meet statutory requirements ,  except where there is an immediate risk to public health ;
525	to be told the procedures for appealing against local authority action .
526	What powers do inspectors have ?
527	They can take samples and photographs ,  and inspect records .
528	You must not obstruct inspectors .
529	They may write to you informally asking you to put right any problems they find .
530	Where breaches of the law are identified which must be put right they may serve you with an improvement notice .
531	They can detain or seize suspect foods .
532	In serious cases they may decide to recommend a prosecution :   if the prosecution is successful ,  the Court may impose prohibitions on processes and the use of premises or equipment ,  fines and possibly imprisonment .
533	If there is an imminent health risk to consumers ,  inspectors can serve on emergency prohibition notice which forbids the use of the premises or equipment .
534	Such a notice must be conformed by the Court .
535	What you can do if you think the outcome is not fair ?
536	If you don't agree with the action taken by the inspector ,  you should first contact your local authority's head of environmental health or trading standards services ,  to see if the problem can be resolved informally .
537	If disagreement remains after that you could approach your local councillor .
538	If you think your local authority is applying the law in a different way from other authorities you can seek advice from the Local Authorities Co - ordinating Body on Food and Trading Standards  ( LACOTS )  either through your trade association or your local authority .
539	You have a right of appeal to a Magistrates' Court against an improvement notice or a refusal by a local authority to list an emergency prohibition order made earlier by the Court .
540	A Magistrates' Court must confirm the emergency closure of a business or the seizure of food .
541	If magistrates decide premises have been shut without proper reason ,  or food has been wrongly seized or detained you have right to compensation .
542	Finally ,  remember :
543	-  your local authority is ready to help if you need any advice on food safety or labelling ;
544	-  trade associations and independent consultancy services can also help ;
545	-  closer partnership between food businesses and local authorities means better public protection and fair trading .
546	Introduction
547	The Food Safety Act and Regulations made under it aim to make sure all food offered to the public is safe to eat and is properly described .
548	This leaflet explains the role of local authority environmental health and trading standards services in helping you to produce safe food and to meet your other responsibilities .
549	Environmental health officers check on food safety and hygiene ;   trade standards officers on food composition and labelling .
550	The leaflet describes :
551	what to expect when your business is inspected under the Act ;
552	what to do if you think the outcome of an inspection is wrong or not fair .
553	Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point  ( HACCP )
554	Practical Food Safety for Businesses
555	What exactly is HACCP ?
556	HACCP stand for 'Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point' .
557	Analysing the potential hazards in an operation ;
558	Identifying the points in the operation where the hazards may occur ;
559	Deciding which are critical to consumer safety .
560	These are the critical control points  ( CCPs )  .
561	The CCPs are monitored .
562	Remedial action ,  specified in avance ,  is taken if conditions at any CCP are not within safe limits .
563	Food safety  -  your responsibility
564	Food businesses have the main responsibility for ensuring the protection of their customers .
565	A business that breaks the law faces the legal sanctions including improvement notices ,  prohibition notices and prosecution .
566	So if you run a food business you need to take care that you meet your obligations .
567	Leaving food safety to chance is risky  -  risky to your customers' health and lives ,  and risky to the health and life of your business .
568	Where does HACCP come in ?
569	HACCP is a practical technique which food businesses can use to help satisfy themselves that their products are safe .
570	Some businesses ,  particularly in the food manufacturing sector ,  have recognised the value of using HACCP to identify potential hazards in their operations and control them before they result in problems .
571	Many more businesses have yet to discover HACCP ,  or to put it into practice .
572	The advantages
573	HACCP is :
574	Systematic all the potential hazards are identified .
575	Efficient it concentrates the control effort at the critical steps in the operation ;
576	Economical it uses checks which can be done cheaply ,  quickly and easily ,  such as measuring time and temperature ,  and visual assessment ;
577	Prompt fast checks allow rapid response when action is needed ;
578	On the spot the process is controlled on the spot by the operator ,  not by a laboratory remote from the operation .
579	How to set up HACCP for your business
580	Form a HACCP team .
581	The team may be large or small ,  depending on the operation .
582	It should be composed of people who know and understand the business's food products and their uses .
583	Remember ,  a V scheme is only as good as the experts who draw it up .
584	Define the process .
585	The team draws up a flow chart of all the aspects of the food operation from raw materials through processing to storage and consumer handling .
586	Identify the hazards and work out the CCPs .
587	A hazard is anything that can harm the consumer and can be physical ,  chemical or microbiological .
588	The team identifies the potential hazards associated with the food at all stages from raw materials ,  processing ,  manufacture and distribution until the point of consumption ,  assesses the likelihood of occurrence of these hazards and identifies the preventive measures necessary for their control .
589	The team then identifies the steps that can be controlled to eliminate each hazard or minimise the likelihood of it occurring .
590	These are CCPs .
591	Recommend monitoring and control procedures .
592	For each CCP the team recommends What is to be done .
593	When it is to be done and Who is to do it .
594	It also lays down the Limits outside which action ,  eg referral to management or consultation with other experts ,  is needed .
595	Implement controls at the CCPs .
596	It is essential to make sure that the recommended monitoring and controls are actually carried out .
597	This will include maintaining records of the HACCP process as well as the controls monitored at the CCP for each batch of food .
598	Review .
599	The design and operation of the HACCP scheme should be reviewed whenever the food operation is altered ,  however slight the alteration may seem .
600	The scheme should be reviewed periodically  ( eg once a year )  even when there have been no alterations .
601	Can anyone use the HACCP system ?
602	The application of a full HACCP system requires the advice and guidance of experts but the principles of HACCP can be applied in any food business .
603	It is important to remember that the details will vary as no two businesses are exactly alike .
604	But similar principles would apply to any food business .
605	Further advice
606	Further advice and assistance can be obtained from the food research associations ,  other reputable consultants and local environmental health departments .

791	-  what you will do to look for work and improve your chances of finding work .
792	If you and the adviser cannot agree on the content of the Jobseeker's Agreement ,  a decision maker will decide if the proposed contents are reasonable .
793	If you do not agree with their decision ,  you can ask for it to be looked at again by another decision maker .
794	If you still do not agree ,  you can appeal .
795	You will not usually be able to get Jobseeker's Allowance until you have a Jobseeker's Agreement .
796	In some situations you may be able to get a reduced allowance under the hardship provision .
797	See next page .
798	Hardship provision
799	You may be able to get a reduced amount of JSA under the hardship provision .
800	You can do this if your JSA cannot be paid under the normal rules for any of the following reasons :
801	-  you are not available for work
802	-  you are not actively seeking work
803	-  you do not have a Jobseeker's Agreement
804	-  you unreasonably make yourself unemployed .
805	For example ,  you leave your job voluntarily without good reason ,  you lose a job because of misconduct or you turn down a job offer
806	-  there is a doubt about whether any of these apply to you
807	-  you have not yet had a decision on your JSA
808	You must be able to show that you or someone in your household would suffer hardship if you do not receive any JSA .
809	If you are in a vulnerable group and you qualify for a hardship payment ,  you will be paid the next time you would usually get your JSA .
810	You are in a vulnerable group if you or your partner :

833	Drugs A Parent's Guide
834	The signs
835	The dangers
836	What to do
837	If you find that your child has been using drugs what can you do ?
838	This is a question with as many different answers as there are families .
839	You must make your own decisions but this booklet will help you .
840	Why are there different answers ?
841	There are many different kinds of drugs  -  some like tobacco are legal ,  others like Ecstasy and cannabis are not .
842	Different drugs have different effects on people ;   some of these effects are more dangerous than others .
843	Some drugs are used in more unsafe ways than others .
844	for example ,  injecting drugs are more dangerous than sniffing or smoking them .
845	Some drugs are more socially acceptable than others .
846	Every child is different and the reasons why they might turn to drugs will be varied .
847	The things which will help them stop using drugs ,  or help them to moderate their use of drugs ,  will also be varied .
848	Parents differ in the way they want to handle drug taking by their children .
849	Some parents will be totally opposed to all drug taking .
850	There are different facilities for helping young people with drug problems in different parts of the country .
851	So where you live may affect what help you can get if you need it .
852	Do you know enough about drugs ?
853	Most parents are not well - informed about the effects of various drugs ;   there is a lot of confusing and inaccurate information around .
854	We can only indicate the most common effects of different drugs because so much depends on the individual who is taking them and the setting in which drugs are used .
855	Also there are no standards of 'quality control' for illegal drugs .
856	they may be adulterated with other substances to increase profits .
857	Having reliable information will help you understand the subject and build your own confidence in talking about drugs with your child .
858	Ultimately ,  however ,  the soundness of your family relationships will be more important than a sound knowledge of drugs .
859	There are no hard or soft drugs ,  no good or bad drugs .
860	It all depends what people do with them and the circumstances under which drugs are used .
861	Morphine is prescribed for cancer patients in pain without them getting 'hooked' on the drug .
862	By contrast ,  one LSD trip might result in psychological damage to somebody with latent mental illness .
863	The availability of drugs .
864	If your child wants to take drugs illegally ,  it is likely that they will eventually find somebody who can supply them .
865	The efforts of the police and customs will never be able to completely stop illegal drugs coming into the country .
866	However ,  the image of pushers hanging around school playground waiting to give children samples is essentially wrong .
867	Of those young people who try illegal drugs ,  most obtain them from friends .
868	As a rule ,  experimentation with drugs such as cannabis and LSD does not start until mid / late teens .
869	Even then ,  very few in this age range will have access to heroin ,  crack or cocaine .
870	The majority of regular drug users are in their twenties .
871	What drugs are available in any given area will vary according to price ,  fashion ,  geographical location and so on .
872	It is more difficult for your children to obtain illegal drugs than legal drugs and solvents like glue and butane gas .
873	How can you educate your children about drugs ?
874	So it isn't possible to control supply ,  what can we do ?
875	Prevention is generally better than cure ,  so how can you help your child develop a sensible ,  informed attitude to drugs ?
876	Perhaps the most important thing that you ,  as a parent ,  can do is to set an example .
877	Your drug use may have a big effect on your child's use .
878	Mum might explain why she takes painkillers when she has a period .
879	Dad might explain that he likes a drink with his friends ,  but never drives afterwards .
880	You can probably think of other examples .
881	Therefore ,  it is important that children understand why we are taking the drugs .
882	And what we do and feel is appropriate and inappropriate drug use .
883	This process can start when children are quite young ,  and it need to continue throughout childhood and adolescence .
884	Some parents will also have used drugs illegally in the past .
885	If this issue is raised with your children ,  express honestly both the pleasures and the problems of that time of your life .
886	Parents who will still use drugs illegally need to think about what they will say to their children if they are discovered ,  smoking cannabis for example .
887	If drug use is discussed in appropriate contexts it may lose some of its attraction as a secretive and mysterious thing to do .
888	Why do young people take drugs ?
889	What can you do about it ?
890	Everyone is individual and will have their own particular reasons for using drugs .
891	Parents try to deal with drug use by their children will need to make sure that they don't jump to conclusions .
892	Instead ,  they need to listen to their child's own explanations to form a round view .
893	However ,  here are some reasons which are quite common :
894	The opportunity rose and the youngster just tried it .
895	Don't panic !
896	Although parents may want to express their concern very strongly and show their child how upset they are ,  they should think about how to do this in the most constructive way .
897	In this example there may no long - term problem .
898	A discussion ,  a warning ,  and some monitoring of behaviour may be appropriate .
899	Just because a youngster has tried a drug does not make them an 'addict' .
900	Over - reaction by parents and other adults may turn what was an isolated incident into attention - seeking behaviour or a focus for opposition .
901	Similarly ,  drugtaking may be a response to loneliness ,  feeling inadequate or lacking self - esteem or confidence .
902	If so ,  it is important to find this out and help the young person overcome these difficulties without turning to drugs .
903	Teenagers often have problems with their self - image and may need reassurance from parents that they are loved .
904	What about longer term use ?
905	If the use of drugs involves a group of youngsters ,  then providing alternative leisure activities which are more interesting and more fun than drugs seems to be the best approach .
906	Trips out of town and sport can be good ways of making drugtaking less interesting and therefore less likely .
907	Parents shouldn't just have this to youth workers ,  but get involved themselves ,  perhaps starting projects with the help of the youth services .
908	For those few young people who are dependent on drugs a lot of careful work may be needed .
909	It isn't a good idea to focus too much on the use of drugs ,  but rather on the other problems and difficulties that the young person has .
910	If they can be helped with these problems then they will probably stop ,  or at least reduce ,  their drug intake .
911	In the meantime ,  it is sensible to give advice on how to reduce damage to health .
912	How other parents have coped .
913	A story based on the real - life experience of parents and children .
914	The importance of understanding .
915	Joe ,  then aged 15 ,  lived with his mother and stepfather ,  Eddie .
916	Joe and Eddie were never really close but they managed to get along well enough at first .
917	Then a spell of unemployment for Eddie led to heavy drinking and frequent family squabbles .
918	Seeing his mother so upset made Joe angry .
919	He blamed his stepfather ,  and said so .
920	When a friend offered him something called skag  ( heroin )  he accepted .
921	It seemed to make him fell better about everything .
922	After that ,  whenever he felt particularly down he'd get hold of some more heroin .
923	It didn't take Joe's mum long to guess what was going on .
924	She realised that family problems had a lot to do with it ,  and did her best to reassure Joe about her love for him .
925	Importantly ,  she helped Eddie to see what was happening ,  so that they could work out their own problems .
926	Joe felt happier knowing that his mother really cared about him and that even Eddie seemed to be trying harder to keep the family peace .
927	Joe can now live without drugs .
928	You ,  your child and the law .
929	Nobody below ten years of age in England and Wales ,  or below in Scotland ,  can be convicted of a criminal offence .
930	Above these ages ,  it all depends on the drugs the youngster is taking or supplying .
931	Maximum sentences for offending against the Misuse of Drugs Act are severe .
932	First offenders who have a drug for their own use are likely to get off with a fine and may even just be cautioned by the police .
933	But regular offenders ,  people selling drugs or drug smugglers ,  mighty have all their money ,  goods and property confiscated and be imprisoned for many years  -  the current maximum for drug trafficking is life imprisonment .
934	However ,  young people are unlikely to suffer the worst of these penalties .
935	In England and Wales youngsters under 17 years of age are usually dealt with by a Juvenile Court .
936	This court has powers to fine parent or child ,  or to make the offender attend a variety of institutions as an alternative to being sent to prison .
937	Your legal responsibilities .
938	Most parents are aware that their sons or daughters might be fined or imprisoned for possessing or supplying illegal drugs .
939	But many don't realise that it is possible to fall foul of the law ,  even without touching drugs .
940	Just allowing anyone on your 'premises' to produce or supply illegal drugs to another person is itself an offence .
941	So if a parent knows that their son or daughter is sharing illegal drugs with a friend in their home ,  but does nothing to stop it ,  than the parent has committed an offence .
942	If you find drugs
943	If a parent or other member of the public finds what they think is an illegal drug ,  they must according to the law either hand it to the police or destroy it to prevent another person committing an offence with the drug .
944	Do I have to tell the police ?
945	Parents do not have to tell the police if they know or suspect their children  ( or anyone else )  are taking or supplying illegal drugs .
946	Drugs :   A Guide
947	There is a large range of drugs  -  some illegal ,  some not  -  that can be misused with varying effects .
948	This guide covers the main types and describes common effects and methods of use .
949	There is a brief indication of slang terms you may hear .
950	However ,  these can be very localised and change rapidly .
951	These terms are best avoided when talking to children as they can trivialise the subject .
952	Also you might look silly using slang terms no longer in fashion .
953	Alcohol and tobacco are excluded from this guide because most people are already familiar with them ,  even though young people are more likely to use them on a long term basis with potentially serious consequences for health .
954	Some terms explained .
955	Physical dependence :   where the body gets used to the presence of a drug and the person has to keep taking it to prevent withdrawal symptoms .
956	Withdrawal :   where the body reacts to the drug being stopped .
957	Psychological dependence :   where the persons think they need to carry on using drugs to cope with life .
958	Tolerance :   where increasing amounts of the drugs are needed .
959	Solvents
960	Solvents sniffing is not illegal ;   after drinking and smoking ,  solvents are the substances young people are most likely to experiment with .
961	The range of products of this type is extensive and widely available and includes :
962	Aerosol sprays  ( like hairspray or pain - relieving sprays )  .
963	Butane gas  ( used as cigarette lighter fuel )  .
964	Solvent - based - glues  ( like Evo - Stik )  .
965	Dry - cleaning fluids .
966	Paint and paint thinners .
967	Correcting fluids  ( like Tipp - Ex )  .
968	Petrol .
969	Solvent misuse is covered in the booklet 'Solvents  -  A parent's guide' .
970	Cannabis
971	cannabis is the most commonly used of the illegal drugs .
972	It is usually smoked in the form of resin ,  a brown solid mass which is crumbled and mixed with tobacco .
973	A quarter of an ounce of cannabis resin costs between  Â£15 - 25 and would make about 20 cannabis cigarettes .
974	Not everyone gets much effect from cannabis .
975	The most common effects are relaxation ,  talkativeness ,  a sense of well - being and a heightened perception of music and colour .
976	Sometimes there can be temporary anxiety or mild hallucinations
977	One of the main dangers of cannabis is the state of intoxication itself .
978	The person may not be able to drive ,  cross roads or operate machinery safely .
979	People do not become physically dependent on cannabis ,  but can become psychologically dependent for enjoyment ,  or coping with life .
980	Like tobacco ,  long - term ,  regular and heavy cannabis smoking may cause respiratory diseases such as bronchitis or lung cancer .
981	The belief still persists that smoking cannabis leads to the use of so - called 'hard' drugs like heroin .
982	The theory is that when people no longer achieve a 'high' from cannabis ,  they try something stronger .
983	However ,  there is nothing 'in' cannabis itself which predisposes users to try heroin .
984	Stimulants
985	These drugs stimulate the nerve system ,  banish tiredness for a time and produce feelings of alertness and confidence .
986	Amphetamine .
987	This is the most common illegal stimulant .
988	In the sixties ,  the drug came in pill form purple hearts .
989	Nowadays ,  it is mainly found as a white powder which is usually sniffed ,  but can also be injected .
990	Amphetamine is relatively cheap  ( often no more than  Â£15 a gram )  and also heavily cut with other substances that look like the drug .
991	One dose of amphetamine can last three to four hours .
992	Users quickly establish a tolerance and heavy users can experience unpleasant side - effects like disturbed sleep ,  loss of appetite ,  uncomfortable itching leading to prolonged scratching and feelings of acute anxiety of paranoia .
993	Even after long - term regular use there are no dangerous withdrawal symptoms .
994	However the user may feel tired ,  hungry ,  depressed or even suicidal in the period immediately after stopping using the drug and continue to feel unwell for some time .
995	As a powerful stimulant drug ,  its use might be dangerous for those with any kind of heart conditions or a history of major psychiatric disorder .
996	Cocaine and crack .
997	Cocaine is a white powder which is usually sniffed ,  but can also be injected .
998	Crack or freebase is cocaine that can be smoked .
999	It looks like a small crystal about the size of a raisin and is smoked in a pipe or placed on a place of tin foil ,  heated and the vapours inhaled .
1000	Cocaine powder is an expensive drug ,  both because of the actual cost  ( anything up to  Â£100 a gram )  and because the effect of any one dose is only about 20 - 30 minutes .
1001	Crack is also expensive ;   each small crystal can cost  Â£20 and it lasts only about 10 - 20 minutes .
1002	The effects and longer - term consequences of the drug are similar to those of amphetamine ,  except that smoking a powerful drug may cause respiratory problems such as shortness of breath and chest pains .
1003	Ecstasy
1004	Ecstasy is usually available as a white ,  brown ,  pink or yellow tablet ,  or coloured capsules ,  selling at anything from  Â£12 - 25 each .
1005	'White doves' ,  'disco burgers' and 'New Yorkers' are some common types .
1006	The effects start after about 20 minutes and can last several hours .
1007	Users say that the drug has a calming effect with heightened perceptions of colours and sounds .
1008	Co - ordination may be affected by Ecstasy ,  so it could be dangerous to drive or operate machinery under its influence .
1009	At higher doses ,  Amphetamine - like effects begin to take over and the user may feel anxious or confused .
1010	If the drug is taken regularly over few days ,  the user could suffer temporary paranoia and insomnia .
1011	Tolerance builds up to the effects of the drug ,  but Ecstasy is not physically addictive .
1012	However as the drug acts like a stimulant ,  those with heart conditions ,  high blood pressure or subject to epileptic fits or any kind of mental illness should avoid using it .
1013	There have been some deaths associated with Ecstasy .
1014	it would appear that the young people concerned may have been particularly susceptible to the stimulant effects ,  although why is yet unclear .
1015	Hallucinogens
1016	The most commonly used hallucinogens are LSD  ( acid )  and Liberty Cap mushrooms  ( 'magic mushrooms ,  shrooms or mushies' )
1017	LSD is manufactured illegally ;   minute quantities are impregnated into small squares of blotting paper which are then dissolved on the tongue .
1018	These squares often carry colourful abstract designs or pictures of cartoon or film characters such as the Pink Panther .
1019	LSD may be sold using the designs as trade names eg 'strawberries' or 'Chinese dragon' .
1020	'Magic mushrooms' grow wild in many parts of the country and it is not illegal to pick and eat them raw .
1021	However ,  each mushroom contains the drug psilocybin  -  this is the drug that causes the hallucinogenic effects and it is an illegal drug like LSD .
1022	Preparing the mushrooms eg cooking or brewing or even just drying them out might result in a criminal charge .
1023	These drugs are not addictive and are not known to cause damaging physical effects on the body .
1024	How they affect the mind will depend on how the person is feeling at the time and whether or not the surroundings are friendly and supportive .
1025	Experiences will vary from visions of joy and beauty to waking nightmares .
1026	Perceptions of the world will appear distorted .
1027	The main danger of any hallucinogenic drug is that the experience may be damaging to someone with mental illness or worse ,  may trigger a psychotic response in somebody whose condition was undiagnosed .
1028	Less seriously ,  inexperienced users can feel confused and disoriented for some time after taking the drug and may need reassurance that they are not going crazy .
1029	Users may also experience something called a 'flashback'  -  where the 'trip' is relived without actually taking the drug .
1030	A specific danger with mushrooms is picking the wrong ones  -  some species are highly poisonous .
1031	Tranquillisers and sedatives
1032	The most commonly prescribed tranquillisers belong to a group known as benzodiazepines  -  the best known being Valium ,  Ativan and Librium .
1033	These drugs are only meant to be prescribed for few weeks to help cope with a crisis .
1034	However ,  over 250 , 000 people in this country have regular prescriptions for those drugs ,  some stretching over several years .
1035	It is easy to become psychologically dependent and people who try and stop may suffer very unpleasant withdrawal symptoms .
1036	These drugs are commonly found in many medicine cabinets .
1037	Young people may experiment with them and some types may even be sold on the streets .
1038	It is difficult to overdose these drugs ,  unless other sedatives like alcohol are used at the same time .
1039	Anabolic Steroids
1040	These are not to be confused with the various corticosteroid drugs often prescribed by doctors for conditions such as rheumatold arthritis and Crohn's Disease and also hormone replacement therapy .
1041	Anabolic steroids have only a very limited use in ordinary medicine such as building up muscle in a patient who has been bedridden for some time .
1042	They are misused by some athletes and bodybuilders in order to increase muscle size and because they are derived from the male hormone testosterone ,  they also stimulate aggression .
1043	Athletes claim this helps them to train harder and recover more quickly from injury .
1044	There are many potential problems associated with these drugs .
1045	Often the drugs are injected using shared equipment with the attendant risks of infection ;
1046	In young people ,  use of these drugs can restrict growth ;
1047	In men ,  there may be temporary side effects on the reproductive system ,  such as reduced sex drive and lowered sperm count ;
1048	In women ,  'masculine' side effects such as deeper voice and smaller breasts may not be reversible when drug use ceases ;
1049	Although rare ,  steriods may cause death from liver cancer .
1050	These drugs often circulate in gymnasiums and health clubs .
1051	It is not illegal to possess them ,  but it is illegal to supply them to anybody under 18 .
1052	Heroin
1053	Heroin can be injected ,  sniffed or smoked .
1054	For smoking ,  the drug is placed on some tin foil or perhaps a spoon and then heated .
1055	The fumes are then inhaled ,  a method sometimes known as 'chasing' or 'chasing the dragon' .
1056	On the streets ,  heroin will be cut with other substances such as glucose and wrapped for sale in small plastic bags ;   these 'wraps' or 'bags' containing heroin might sell for perhaps  Â£5 or  Â£10 .
1057	Regular users say that heroin produces a sense of warm and pleasant drowsiness .
1058	However ,  for the novice there can be immediate and unpleasant side - effects like nausea and vomiting ,  which will often deter somebody experimenting with the drug ,  from ever trying it again .
1059	Someone 'high' on heroin will often be able to function relatively normally ,  though they may appear slightly drowsy and their speech slurred .
1060	As well as developing tolerance to the drug ,  regular heroin users are often in poor health because of an inadequate diet .
1061	They often suffer from constipation and among women the menstrual cycle is often interrupted .
1062	Even among those who have experienced with heroin ,  only a portion will go on to be regular users .
1063	It may take several weeks or months of heavy ,  regular use to become physically addicted .
1064	Injecting
1065	Injecting carries with it a ,  number of risk .
1066	Infection where injecting equipment is unsterile and shared .
1067	The most serious injection is HIV  ( which causes AIDS )  ,  but also hepatitis ;
1068	Abscesses and thrombosis and other conditions from injecting drugs in pill form that were never intended for injection ;
1069	Gangrene  ( from hitting an artery instead of a vein )  and blood poisoning caused by a wound becoming infected ;
1070	Overdose when a drug  ( of unknown strength )  is delivered directly into the bloodstream .
1071	Injecting can be one of the most dangerous ways of taking drugs .
1072	How to spot drug taking .
1073	It isn't easy  -  especially when a child first tries drugs or only takes them occasionally .
1074	many signs are just like the normal signs of growing up .
1075	So if your child suddenly becomes moody or distant  -  don't jump to conclusions .
1076	Getting help
1077	Sometimes things get out of hand .
1078	Parents may be unwilling or unable to tackle a drug problem at its earliest stages ;
1079	they may not even know there's a problem until it's serious and they can no longer cope .
1080	Specialist services .
1081	If you feel you need help from a specialist drug service ,  but are unable to find one locally ,  contact the Standing Conference on Drug Abuse at Waterbridge House ,  32 - 36 Loman Street ,  London SE1 0EE .
1082	Telephone 071 - 928 - 9500 .
1083	Day Projects ,  Information and Advisory Services .
1084	These are places that parents and drug users can phone or visit  ( usually by appointment only )  for advice on drugs or associated problems  ( housing ,  legal ,  etc )
1085	For most parents this kind of project will be the only drug agency they approach ,  either as a way into treatment or because they provide sufficient advice and support to enable the family to cope .
1086	Release  -  runs a national 24 - hour emergency telephone service ,  particularly useful if someone has been arrested for a drug offence  -  phone 071 - 603 - 8654 .
1087	Release also has a drug advice line ,  available during normal office hours ,  telephone 071 - 729 - 9904 .
1088	Support services for families of drug users
1089	Adfam National ,  the charity for the families and friends of drug users ,  provides a National Helpline offering information and confidential support  -  phone 071 - 638 - 3700 .
1090	Families Anonymous  -  self - help support group for parents of drug users that has branches in various parts of the country .
1091	phone 071 - 281 - 8889 for further details .
1092	Hospital Clinics
1093	There is an established network of hospital clinics for the treatment of mainly heroin addiction .
1094	Some of these and some GPs too will prescribe reducing doses of methadone ,  a drug like a heroin ,  to ease users of heroin ,  though clinics do differ greatly in the treatment they offer .
1095	Clinics are usually out - patient only ,  though some are able to take a few drug users in for treatment .
1096	They may have social workers and psychologists to help with non - medical problems .
1097	Most clinics are only geared to dealing with very heavy users of opiate - type drugs ,  and are not suitable for help with most other drug problems .
1098	Community Drug Teams
1099	In various parts of the country ,  teams have been set up comprising ,  for example ,  a social worker ,  a community psychiatric nurse ,  a drugs worker and other professionals .
1100	Anybody can make a referral  ( family doctor ,  etc )  or users can go themselves .
1101	Contact SCODA for more details .
1102	Residential services .
1103	These are usually for those who have a serious long - standing problems .
1104	Contact SCODA for more details about these services .
1105	For services in Scotland contact :   Scottish Drugs Forum ,  5 Oswald Street ,  Glasgow G1 4QR .
1106	Telphone :   041 - 221 - 1175 .
1107	For services in Wales contact :   Welsh Office Drugs Unit ,  Welsh Office ,  Cathays Park ,  Cardiff CF1 3NQ .
1108	Telephone :   0222 - 825111 .
1109	What to do in emergency .
1110	Should the worst happen and you find your child drowsy or unconscious ,  it's important that you know what to do .
1111	it could save their life .
1112	First make sure they've got fresh air .
1113	Then turn them on their side and try not to leave them alone  ( otherwise if they are sick ,  they may inhale vomit )  .
1114	Dial 999 and ask for an ambulance .
1115	Finally ,  collect any powders ,  tablets or anything else that may have been used in taking the drug  -  give them to the ambulance driver .
1116	A Shopper's Guide
1117	Your legal rights
1118	How to complain
1119	Where to get help
1120	Foreword
1121	from John Bridgeman ,  Director General ,  Office of Fair Trading
1122	Many people think they have grounds for complaint about something they have bought or a service they have received .
1123	Although some do complain ,  they meet with varying degrees of success .
1124	I believe that where there are genuine grounds for complaint these success rates can be improved .
1125	This booklet gives you advice about how to tackle your shopping and service problems .
1126	You will find general information about your legal rights and how to make a complaint ,  along with advice on dealing with specific problem areas such as cars ,  furniture and holidays .
1127	This booklet cannot ,  however ,  cover all these areas in detail
1128	At the back ,  you will find a number of organisations which can help ,  along with the address to contact for further Office of Fair Trading publications .
1129	Before you buy
1130	Do you know what precautions to take when buying a used car ?
1131	What do you do if you buy a new fridge - freezer and it does not work properly ?
1132	Are you helpless in the hands of a mail - order company which takes your money but sends you faulty goods ?
1133	Do you dread a call from a doorstep salesman ?
1134	Is you knowledge of your legal rights hazy ?  Do you know the most effective way of making a complaint ?
1135	With a little care ,  many consumer problems can be avoided .
1136	Before you hand over your money ,  ask yourself if what you are buying is really what you are looking for and how much you can afford .
1137	Think carefully about how you are going to pay :  with cash or credit ,  or in some other way .
1138	Shop around and compare prices and other factors  ( for example after - sales service )  .
1139	Do not be persuaded into buying something on the spur of the moment .
1140	Think it through first .
1141	And try to go to traders who have a good reputation for treating their customers fairly .
1142	Getting a satisfactory outcome from making a complaint can sometimes be easy  -  but not always .
1143	Most traders do act fairly and try to resolve complaints effectively ,  but it can sometimes be difficult to get a problem sorted out ,  particularly if the item or service was expensive  -  for example ,  car repairs ,  home improvements or household appliances .
1144	Do not give up at the first hurdle of the trader is unhelpful or even obstructive .
1145	If you have a valid compliant ,  you have a right to have the problem sorted out .
1146	It may take some effort on your part but keep trying .
1147	The law is on your side if you have good cause for complaint .
1148	In some cases it may be necessary to go to court to get the matter settled .
1149	This is not as difficult as it sounds and just the threat of it could be enough to resolve matters .
1150	Your legal rights
1151	Safety
1152	It is an offence for a supplier to sell goods unless they are safe .
1153	This applies to both new and secondhand products ,  but not to antiques or to goods needing repair or reconditioning ,  provided you were clearly informed of this fact .
1154	If you believe you have bought unsafe goods ,  you should contact the trading standards department of your local authority .
1155	Prompt action may help prevent accident of injury to other customers .
1156	If new goods turn out to be unsafe and cause death ,  personal injury or damage to other property intended for personal use ,  you may have a claim against the manufacturer .
1157	Buying goods
1158	The law says that goods must be :
1159	Of satisfactory quality  -  they must meet the standard that a reasonable person would regard as acceptable bearing in mind the way they were described ,  what they cost and any other relevant circumstances .
1160	This rule covers ,  for instance ,  the appearance and finish of the goods ,  their safety ,  and their durability .
1161	Goods must be free from defects ,  even minor ones ,  except when they have been brought to your attention by the seller ,  for example ,  if the goods are said to be shop - soiled .
1162	fit for their purposes ,  including any particular purpose mentioned by you to the seller  -  for example ,  if you are buying a computer game and explain that you want one which can be played on a particular type of machine ,  the seller must not give you one that cannot ;
1163	as described  -  on the package or a display sign ,  or by the seller .
1164	If you are told that a shirt is 100 %  cotton ,  then it should not turn out to be cotton and polyester .
1165	These are your statutory rights .
1166	All goods bought or hired from a trader  -  whether from shops ,  street markets ,  mail order catalogues or door - to - door sellers  -  are covered by these rights .
1167	This includes goods bought in sales .
1168	When you decide to complain ,  bear in mind how the item was described .
1169	A new item must look new and unspoiled as well as work properly ,  but if the goods are secondhand or 'seconds' ,  then you cannot expect perfect quality .
1170	Many traders have goodwill policies that go beyond your statutory rights .
1171	For example ,  some stores will allow you to exchange goods which are not faulty ,  such as clothes which are the wrong size .
1172	If things go wrong
1173	If there is something wrong with what you buy ,  tell the seller as soon as possible .
1174	If you are unable to return to the shop within a few days of making the purchase ,  it is a good idea to telephone to let it know about your complaint .
1175	Make a note of the conversation and to whom you spoke .
1176	If you tell the seller promptly that the goods are faulty and you do not want them you should be able to get you money back .
1177	As long as you have not legally 'accepted' the goods you can still 'reject' them  -  that is ,  refuse to accept them .
1178	One of the ways you 'accept' goods is by keeping them ,  without complaint ,  after you have had a reasonable time to examine them
1179	What is reasonable is not fixed ;  it depends on all the circumstances .
1180	But normally you can at least take your purchase home and try it out .
1181	If ,  however ,  you delay in examining what you have bought ,  or in telling the seller about a fault ,  then you may lose your right to reject .
1182	Note that if you signed an 'acceptance note' on receiving goods ,  this does not mean you have signed away your right to reject .
1183	You still have a reasonable time to examine them .
1184	Letting the seller try to put faulty goods right also has no effect on your rights
1185	if the repair fails ,  you still have any right to reject that you had when you agreed to the repair .
1186	When you reject faulty goods you may be offered a replacement ,  free repair or credit note .
1187	You do not have to agree to any such offer .
1188	You can insist on having your money back in full .
1189	If you accept a credit note ,  you will not usually be able to exchange it for cash later on .
1190	So you may be left with an unwanted credit note if you cannot find anything else you like in the shop .
1191	Moreover ,  some credit notes may be valid for only a limited period .
1192	Once you have ,  in the legal sense ,  'accepted goods , ' you lose your right to a full refund .
1193	You can only claim compensation ,  and you have to keep your claim to a reasonable minimum .
1194	Normally you have to accept an offer to put the goods right ,  or the cost of a repair .
1195	Some goods have manufacturers' guarantees .
1196	These are useful when your statutory rights no longer apply .
1197	Claiming under guarantees often results in fewer quibbles than relying on the statutory rights ,  provided you complain within the guarantee period .
1198	See pages 50 - 52 for more on guarantees .
1199	Do not be put off by traders trying to talk their way out of their responsibilities
1200	The law says it is up to the seller to deal with complaints about defective goods or other failures to comply with your statutory rights .
1201	So do not accept the excuse that 'it's the manufacturer's faults , ' although you may have additional rights against the manufacturer under a guarantee .
1202	You have the same rights when you buy sales goods as at any other time ;  the seller cannot get away with notices saying there are no refunds on sales goods .
1203	Think twice before you buy from a trader who displays a notice like this .
1204	It is against the law ,  and local authorities can prosecute the trader .
1205	See page 20 on exclusion clauses .
1206	Exclusion clauses are types of small print which try to limit a trader's responsibilities under a contract .
1207	You have the same rights even if you lose your receipt .
1208	A receipt ,  however ,  is useful evidence of where and when you bought the goods .
1209	You may be able to claim compensation if you suffer loss because of faulty goods ,  for example ,  if a faulty iron ruins your clothes .
1210	If you received the faulty goods as a present ,  you may have to ask the person who bought them to complain for you ,  or to authorise you in writing to complain on your behalf .
1211	Only the buyer has the statutory rights described earlier .
1212	You are not legally obliged to return faulty goods to the seller at your own expense .
1213	If an item is bulky and would be difficult or expensive to return to the shop ,  ask the seller to collect it .
1214	But this does not apply where you complain about faults having 'accepted' the goods ,  or if you got the goods as present .
1215	You have fewer rights if you buy privately  ( that is ,  not from a trader )  or at an auction .
1216	See page 21
1217	But if you are injured by defective goods ,  or they cause property damage costing you  Â£275 or more ,  you have certain rights regardless of how they were bought or whether they were a gift . In these circumstances ,  you can go straight to the manufacturer .
1218	If in doubt seek further advice .
1219	See pages 27 - 29 .
1220	You have no real grounds for complaint if you :
1221	you were told the fault ;
1222	examined the item when you bought it and should have seen the fault ;
1223	did the damage yourself ;
1224	made a mistake when purchasing the item .
1225	simply changed your mind about the item .
1226	Under these circumstances you are not entitled to anything ,  but many shops will help out of goodwill if you have proof of purchase .
1227	It is always worth asking .
1228	Buying a service
1229	When you pay for a service  -  for example ,  from a dry cleaner ,  travel agent ,  car repairer ,  hairdresser or builder  -  you are entitled to certain standards .
1230	A service should be carried out :  with reasonable care and skill  -  a job should be done to a proper standard of workmanship .
1231	If you get a new extension to your house ,  the walls should not to crack and the roof must not leak ;
1232	within a reasonable time  -  even if you have not actually agreed a definite completion time with the supplier of the service ;
1233	a reasonable charge ,  if no price has been fixed in advance  -  if the price was fixed at the outset ,  or some other way of working out the charge was agreed ,  you cannot complain later that it is unreasonable .
1234	Always ask a trader how much a particular job will cost .
1235	The trader may only be able to make an informed guess at the cost and give you an estimate .
1236	If you agree a fixed cost it is usually called a quotation .
1237	A fixed price is binding whatever it is called .
1238	Where materials  ( such as bricks or wallpaper )  are used in provision of a service ,  or the service involves fitting goods  ( such as double - glazing or radiators )  ,  the materials and goods are covered by the same statutory rights as when you buy them directly .
1239	It could be worth checking ,  before you part with your money ,  whether the business or person providing the service is a member of a trade association .
1240	Membership does not guarantee satisfactory work ,  but if anything goes wrong ,  it could make it easier to get things put right .
1241	In some sectors trade associations are very active and have codes of practice .
1242	If a trader does adhere to a code of practice this may also benefit you if a problem arises .
1243	For more on the trade associations ,  see page 29 .
1244	Unfair contract terms
1245	You are not bound by a standard term in a contract with trader if it unfairly weights the contract against you .
1246	This applies particularly to exclusion clauses  -  see page 52 .
1247	In contracts concluded since 1st July 1995 ,  other kinds of unfair 'small print' are also covered .
1248	Examples are penalty clauses  ( except in special circumstances )  terms which give the trader the right to vary the terms of the contract  ( for instance by increasing the price )  without you having a right to withdraw .
1249	Other examples are terms which :  stop you holding back any part of the price of goods or services if they turn out to be defective ;  prevent you from withdrawing from the contract while allowing the trader to do so ;  allow the trader to dishonour promises ,  for instance ,  those made by a salesman ;  stop you from being able to go to court over a dispute .
1250	The law applies to standard terms  -  those you have not negotiated yourself  -  in contracts for goods and services that you buy as a consumer .
1251	Terms that define what you get and how much you pay are not covered unless they are unclear .
1252	So the law cannot be used to argue that a contract does not represent fair value for money .
1253	It is up to the courts to decide if a term is unfair .
1254	If you think a term is unfair and you do not want to be bound by it ,  you may wish to seek advice from your local trading standards department or citizens advice bureau .
1255	Since 1 October 1999 trading standards departments ,  statutory regulators and the Consumers' Association have the power to consider if a term is unfair ,  and to take court action to stop its use in future contracts .
1256	Alternatively ,  you can write to the Director General of Fair Trading who will ,  similarly ,  consider whether a term is unfair .
1257	Neither the Director General nor the other organisations can get involved with individual cases .
1258	Further guidance ,  particularly on what terms are and are not considered unfair ,  can be found inn the regular Bulletins produced by the Office of Fair Trading  ( see address on the lat page )  .
1259	Making a complaint
1260	When you complain ,  get your facts right and always keeping calm .
1261	You are more likely to get matters resolved if you do not lose your temper .
1262	Complaining about goods
1263	Go back to the shop as soon as possible .
1264	If you have the receipt or other proof of purchase ,  take this with you .
1265	Explain the problem ,  say what you want done ,  and set a deadline .
1266	If you are not satisfied ,  put your complaint in writing .
1267	If the shop is part of a chain ,  write to the head office .
1268	Address your letter to the customer services manager or the chairman .
1269	If none of this works ,  get further advice ,  or consider whether you want to take the matter further by going to court .
1270	Complaining about services
1271	Give the supplier a chance to put the matter right .
1272	If you are not satisfied ,  put your complaint in writing ,  saying what you have done ,  and set a deadline .
1273	If you are dealing with a larger business ,  address your letter to the customer services manager or the chairman .
1274	Consider withholding any further money until the problem has been sorted out ,  but check the small print of any contract you have signed .
1275	It may be desirable to seek further advice .
1276	Be especially careful about withholding payments if you have a credit agreement .
1277	You may wish to take advice on this .
1278	If you stop paying ,  it could affect your credit rating and so your chance of getting credit in the future .
1279	Continuing to pay will not undermine any claim you have against the lender for unsatisfactory service by a supplier .
1280	See pages 42 - 43 on extra protection when you pay by credit .
1281	Keep copies of letters along with a diary of events and a note of any telephone calls .
1282	Take photographs if relevant .
1283	Consider getting a written expert opinion to back up your complaint .
1284	The motoring organisations can ,  for example ,  provide reports on cars ,  but any reputable trader with relevant experience can count as an expert .
1285	This may cost money ,  but could be invaluable if you need to take legal action .
1286	If you did not fix a price and you think you have been overcharged when the bill arrives ,  get quotes from other traders for comparison when you complain .
1287	Some may charge to provide a quote .
1288	If you telephone :
1289	1 .  make a note beforehand of what you want to say ;
1290	2 .  have receipts and any other documents handy ;
1291	3 .  get the name of the person you want to speak to ;
1292	4 .  write down the date and time and what is said ;
1293	5 .  follow up your call with a letter ,  particularly if your complaint is a serious one .
1294	If you put it in writing :
1295	1 .  describe the item or service ;
1296	2 .  say where and when you bought the item or when the service was done ,  and how much it cost ;
1297	3 .  explain what is wrong ,  any action you have already taken ,  to whom you spoke and what happened ;
1298	4 .  say what you want done to remedy the situation  -  for example a refund or a repair ,  or the job done again without charge ;
1299	5 .  consider using special delivery so that you can easily check whether your letter has been delivered ;
1300	6 .  keep copies of any letters you send .
1301	Do not send original documents ,  such as receipts and guarantees  -  send copies instead .
1302	If you have a problem with goods or services bought on credit ,  you may have some additional protection .
1303	See pages 42 - 43 .
1304	Who can help ?
1305	If you cannot seem to get anywhere with your complaint or you need some extra advice ,  the following organisations may be able to help you .
1306	Trading standards  ( or consumer protection )  departments of local authorities
1307	They can help in many situations relating to goods and services .
1308	They have powers to investigate complaints about false or misleading prices ,  inaccurate measures ,  consumer credit and  ( except in Northern Ireland )  the safety of consumer goods .
1309	They will often advise on everyday shopping problems .
1310	The address is in the telephone book under the local authority to which you pay your council tax .
1311	In Northern Ireland contact the trading standards branch of the Department of Economic Development .
1312	Some trading standards departments run consumer advice centres near main shopping areas .
1313	These offer advice and information to shoppers and traders ,  and deal with problems and complaints .
1314	Environmental health departments
1315	These deal with health matters such as unfit food and drink ,  dirty shops and restaurants ,  and ,  in Northern Ireland ,  consumer safety matters .
1316	The address is in the telephone book under the local authority to which you pay your council tax .
1317	Citizens advice bureaux
1318	They can help with a wide variety of problems ,  including shopping complaints .
1319	Look under citizens advice bureaux in the phone book .
1320	Trade associations
1321	Traders often belong to trade associations .
1322	Some of these have codes of practice ,  and some have low cost conciliation or arbitration schemes .  A code of practice is not legally binding ,  but it can be a guide as to whether traders have broken rules by which they claim to abide .
1323	If they have ,  then an arbitrator should find in your favour .
1324	Not everyone who claims to be a member of a trade association is ,  so it is worth checking with the association .
1325	You can find the names and addresses of relevant trade associations from your local library or citizens advice bureau .
1326	Utilities
1327	If you have a complaint about utilities  ( gas ,  water ,  electricity ,  or telephones )  ,  try first to sort out the problem with the company .
1328	Your bill will have a customer service telephone number that you can call .
1329	These four utilities all have a regulator who has the power to help resolve customers' problems .
1330	Contact numbers for these regulators can also be found on the back of your bill .
1331	There are ombudsmen for services such as banking ,  building societies ,  funerals and insurance .
1332	See pages 89 - 90 for addresses .
1333	Taking further action
1334	If you are struggling to get a complaint sorted out ,  you can take further action .
1335	Just telling a trader who is being unhelpful or obstructive that you will go to court could be enough to get your complaint resolved .
1336	If you do have to take legal action ,  it can be much easier than it sounds and could be well worth the effort .
1337	Conciliation and arbitration
1338	If the trader is a member of a trade association ,  there may be a conciliation or arbitration scheme you can use .
1339	Some associations have both .
1340	Do not be put off  -  such schemes are informal and generally inexpensive .
1341	But arbitration may not necessarily be cheaper than going to court under the small claims procedure .
1342	Check what fees you will be expected to pay if you lose the case .
1343	In conciliation ,  the idea is to enable the parties to settle their differences themselves .
1344	It does not result in a legally binding decision ,  and if you are not satisfied with the outcome ,  you can go on to arbitration ,  or to court .
1345	Arbitration is more like going to court ,  and is very straightforward .
1346	Both sides put their case and the arbitrator  ( arbiter in Scotland )  makes a decision .
1347	The arbitrator or arbiter will be independent and an expert in the particular field concerned ,  and may be a member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators .
1348	You have to choose between court and arbitration  -  you cannot do both .
1349	If you do not like an arbitrator's decision ,  you cannot then go to court  ( except in special circumstances )  .
1350	Under the Arbitration Act 1996 ,  a clause in which says that says that you have to go to arbitration cannot bind you provided the value of your dispute is not greater than the small claims limit .
1351	Arbitration is often done in writing .
1352	If you feel happier putting your case in person ,  you should consider using the small claims procedure in the County Court .
1353	Before going to arbitration or to court you may wish to seek an impartial opinion on the merits of your case .
1354	This is best obtained from a solicitor .
1355	Some solicitors work in law centres or advice agencies which offer free advice .
1356	Many solicitors in private practice offer a low - cost initial interview .
1357	Your local citizens advice bureau can help you find such a solicitor .
1358	Going to court
1359	If you do not want to use a trade association scheme or no such scheme exists ,  you can go to court to sue for the return of your money or for compensation .
1360	This is easier than it sounds .
1361	It covers actions of up to  Â£5 , 000 in England and Wales ,   Â£1 , 000 in Northern Ireland and  Â£750 in Scotland .
1362	These 'small claims' cases are heard informally in private .
1363	Fees depend on the amount claimed .
1364	The small claims procedure is designed to be used without either side having to go to solicitors .
1365	If your opponent employs a solicitor ,  you cannot be charged the cost even if you lose your case .
1366	The only exception to this rule is if the court thinks you cause unnecessary costs ,  for instance ,  by making a wholly unreasonable claim or not attending the hearing .
1367	To start a small claims action ,  fill in a summons form with your name and address ,  that of your opponent  ( the 'defendant' or ,  in Scotland ,  'defender' )  and a brief statement of your case .
1368	You do not need to use technical language .
1369	Take or send the completed form to your local County Court or Sheriff Court .
1370	There is a court fee ,  but this is payable by your opponent if you win your case .
1371	Outside Scotland the fee is  Â£10 per  Â£100 claimed ,  with a minimum fee of   Â£20 .  Over   Â£1 , 000 to   Â£5 , 000 the fee is   Â£100 .
1372	In Scotland the fees are   Â£6 for claims up to   Â£50 and   Â£36 for claims over   Â£50 to   Â£750 .   ( These fees are subject to change .  )
1373	The court will 'serve' the summons on the defendant and tell you what to do next .
1374	The necessary forms are available from the court office  ( look under 'Courts' in the telephone book for the address )  together with an information booklet .
1375	Some bookshops sell advice packs which includes the forms .
1376	You can get advice ,  leaflets explaining court procedure ,  and help filling in the court forms from your local citizens advice bureau or consumer advice centre .
1377	Some of these can provide free legal advice as well ,  and some one may even be able to go to court with you .
1378	Leaflets are also available from any County or Sheriff Court .
1379	Useful things to know
1380	Misleading prices
1381	It is a criminal offence for traders to make misleading price claims about goods or services .
1382	For example ,  'Was   Â£120 .  Now   Â£99 . 99' is misleading if the goods or services have never been provided at the higher price .
1383	It is also misleading if a trader fails to show 'hidden extras' ,  or to make it clear when a price is conditional on ,  say ,  another purchase .
1384	If you consider that you have been seriously misled about a price tell your local trading standards department and ask it to investigate .
1385	Untrue claims
1386	It is a criminal offence for a trader to say or write something which is untrue about goods or  ( in some circumstances )  services . For example ,  if a car is said to have run only 20 , 000 miles ,  or the dry cleaner offers a 24 hour service ,  these statements must be true . If you feel you have been seriously misled ,  tell your local trading standards department .
1387	Estimates and quotations
1388	When you need or want to have a service done ,  find out in advance what it will cost by getting an estimate or quotation .
1389	An estimate is generally a rough price while a quotation is normally a fixed price .
1390	Make sure you know which you are getting and ask for it to be put in writing .
1391	Check whether prices quoted include VAT .
1392	Buying on credit
1393	Most people at some time will enter an agreement to purchase goods or services on credit ,  for example ,  by obtaining a personal loan through a bank or building society ,  hire purchase ,  or signing a credit agreement with a trader .
1394	Before entering a credit agreement you should consider the following points :
1395	work out what the total cost of the loan will be ;
1396	shop around for credit :  how much will a loan cost to repay each month and for how long ?
1397	Check also the annual percentage rate of charge  ( normally referred to as APR )  .  Generally speaking ,  the lower the APR the better the deal .
1398	Some traders offer interest - free credit  ( 0 %  APR )  but you will need to take care that you are not paying more in other ways ;
1399	for example ,  the cash price may be higher than you would pay for the same goods elsewhere ;
1400	make sure you can afford to pay back the loan and the interest  -  and still have enough to cover all your other commitments .
1401	Check whether the loan has a variable rate of interest .
1402	If it has ,  your repayments can go up as well as down .
1403	If you are refused credit you have certain rights .
1404	You have the right to know the name and address of any credit reference agency that the lender contacted for details about you ;  the right to see any information held about you by that agency and the right to correct any inaccurate information .
1405	See the last page for details of the leaflet 'No Credit ? '
1406	Some loans are only given if they are secured on your home .
1407	These are not available if you rent .
1408	A secured loan gives security to the lender ,  not to you .
1409	If you cannot keep up repayments the lender can sell your home to cover any loss .
1410	You might get a lower rate of interest with a secured loan but you could have a lot at stake .
1411	Right to cancel
1412	If you change your mind and want to cancel a credit deal ,  you should be all right if ;
1413	the deal was made within the last few days ;  and
1414	you talked to the lender or supplier in person  ( not on the telephone )  ;  and
1415	when you signed the credit agreement you were not on the lender's or supplier's business premises  ( including an exhibition stand )  .
1416	You cannot normally use these rights to cancel purchases made with a credit card because you will have entered the agreement for the card some time ago .
1417	When you sign ,  you should be given a copy of the credit agreement ,  which sets out your cancellation rights .
1418	You should also receive ,  by post ,  a second copy or notice of your cancellation rights .
1419	If you can cancel ,  there should be a cancellation box on your copy of the agreement telling you what to do .
1420	Act quickly ,  as there are tight time limits .
1421	If you change your mind and the lender has not yet signed the agreement ,  you have the right to withdraw from a credit deal .
1422	Any goods you were buying through a credit agreement will have to go back .
1423	It is the shop's responsibility to collect them .
1424	Make sure you keep them in good condition until they are taken away .
1425	Credit brokers' fees
1426	If you use a broker to get a loan ,  including a mortgage or a loan secured on your home ,  you will probably be charged a fee for the service .
1427	Make sure you know what this will be before you commit yourself .
1428	If ,  however ,  you do not enter into an agreement within six months of being introduced to a possible lender ,  the broker can only charge a fee or commission of   Â£5 and if you have already paid more ,  you can recover the excess .
1429	Similarly ,  other fees ,  such as a survey fee or insurance premium paid to the credit broker in connection with a loan that you do not eventually take up ,  are also refundable to you for credit agreements up to   Â£25 , 000 .
1430	Extra protection
1431	Buying on credit gives you some extra rights ,  for example ,  if goods are faulty .
1432	If a trader has an arrangement with a finance or credit card company to allow you to pay by credit ,  you have extra protection .
1433	This applies if the goods cost more than   Â£100 .
1434	The credit company is equally liable for any claim you have against the trader .
1435	For example ,  if the goods are not delivered or are not what you ordered ,  or a holiday was wrongly described or you did not get what you paid for ,  you may be able to claim from the credit card or finance company .
1436	It is sensible to approach the trader first .
1437	You can ,  however ,  make a claim against the credit card issuer or finance company without doing this .
1438	You do not have these rights if you pay with a debit card  ( where the money is taken out of your account immediately )  or a charge card  ( where you must pay all you owe within a few weeks of receiving the account )  .
1439	Settling up early
1440	You may find that part way through repaying your loan ,  you have enough money to pay off the whole amount owing in one go .
1441	If so ,  you could be entitled to a rebate of some of the charges you would have paid over the rest of the life of the loan .
1442	It depends on the type of agreement you have with the lender .
1443	It can sometimes cost more than you expect to settle early and in some cases you could still have to pay more than the original amount borrowed .
1444	Even so ,  settling early will cost less than carrying on with the repayments plus interest for the full length of the loan .
1445	Goods on order from a shop
1446	If you order something not in stock or which requires delivery ,  such as a new suite of furniture ,  you must agree a date by which you must have it .
1447	It is a good idea to get this in writing as If the goods do not arrive on time you can refuse to accept them .
1448	If you do not need the goods by a specific time ,  you could ask for an estimated delivery date .
1449	But even if you do not agree a delivery date the seller must deliver in a reasonable time .
1450	If you think enough time has passed and do not want to wait any longer ,  tell the seller .
1451	Say that if an item has not come within a certain period  ( 14 days might be reasonable )  you want your money back .
1452	But if you agree at that point to wait longer  -  say an extra month  -  you cannot cancel in that time .
1453	When you order something ,  you and the seller should agree a fixed price .
1454	You may agree that if the cost of the goods goes up before delivery ,  you will pay the increase .
1455	In some instances the cost may not be known .
1456	Whatever the situation ,  make sure you know where you stand ,  preferably in writing .
1457	Mail order
1458	You have the same statutory rights when you buy through mail order as when you buy from a shop ,  but there are other things you need to consider .
1459	Be particularly careful when giving your credit card details over the telephone that you are dealing with a reliable trader .
1460	Goods should be delivered within a reasonable time ,  usually 28 days or as specified in the advertisement .
1461	If the goods do not turn up you can cancel the order and ask for the money back .
1462	But if you agree to allow the seller extra time ,  you cannot cancel until that time is up .
1463	The law allows you a reasonable time to examine the goods .
1464	Do this as soon as you can and if they are faulty send them back immediately with a note explaining the problem .
1465	Keep a copy of your note .
1466	It is also advisable to get a proof of postage certificate from the Post Office .
1467	Most mail order catalogues have special arrangements for the return of goods .
1468	In other cases ,  the company should reimburse you for the cost of returning the goods .
1469	If you order through an advertisement read it thoroughly before placing an order and keep a copy .
1470	If you cannot keep a copy ,  note the advertiser's name and address ,  where and when the advertisement appeared ,  when you posted the order and any other details ,  such as charges for postage and packing .
1471	Try to avoid sending cash in the post .  Use cheques or postal orders
1472	If you have to send cash ,  send it by registered post .
1473	If ordering from a book or record club ,  make sure you know what commitment you are making .
1474	Find out exactly what you have to buy and over how long in order to qualify for the introductory offer .
1475	Most newspapers and magazines have mail order protection schemes .
1476	These cover you if you send payment in advance for goods in response to an advertisement ,  and the firm goes out of business before you get the goods or a refund .
1477	You can write to the publication's advertising manager for help .
1478	Many mail order companies belong to trade associations which may offer ways of resolving problems .
1479	Look for a trade association logo in advertisements or catalogues .
1480	If you receive goods through the post that you have not ordered ,  you do not have to accept them .
1481	Write to the firm explaining that you do not want the goods .
1482	If they are not collected within 30 days ,  they become yours .
1483	If you do not write to the firm ,  put the goods to one side ,  unused ,  after six months they will become yours .
1484	A firm which demands payment for unsolicited goods could be breaking the law .
1485	If you come across this problem contact your local trading standards department .
1486	Direct mail
1487	Many items bought by post are in response to direct marketing through catalogues ,  newspapers ,  magazines ,  inserts ,  postal advertising sent to you by name or hand delivered ,  or as a result of advertisements appearing on the television ,  radio or posters .
1488	Some people are happy to receive the offers for goods or services which come through the letterbox .
1489	Others find them a nuisance and would prefer not to receive them .
1490	If you do not want to receive this sort of mail ,  you can ask for your name to be deleted from direct mailing lists by writing to the Mailing Preference Service .
1491	It may take up to three months for the unwanted mail to stop arriving .
1492	See page 94 for the address .
1493	Telephone sales
1494	Many companies now use the telephone to promote their goods and services .
1495	If you would like to reduce the number of sales calls you receive ,  contact your Telephone Preference Service .
1496	See page 94 .
1497	If you are registered with the Telephone Preference Service it is an offence for a company to continue to make unsolicited calls to you .
1498	If the calls keep coming you can take up the matter with the Office of Telecommunications  ( Oftel )  .
1499	Deposits
1500	Think twice before you pay anything for goods and services before you receive them .
1501	If the firm goes out of business ,  you could get little or nothing back
1502	The best course is not to pay in advance unless you have to .
1503	Sometimes it is probably unavoidable :  for example ,  with home improvements or made - to - measure goods .
1504	Try avoid paying a deposit  ( especially a large amount )  to a firm you know little or nothing about ,  particularly if the address consists simply of a box number and postcode .
1505	Try to find out something about the firm .
1506	If it is local ,  make sure it is listed in the telephone book .
1507	Ask the firm if it belongs to a trade association which runs a scheme to protect prepayments .
1508	If you do pay anything in advance make sure you get a receipt showing the name and address .
1509	If you pay a deposit and then cancel the order ,  the firm could claim to be entitled to keep your deposit .
1510	Check whether deposits are returnable ,  and ,  if so ,  in precisely what circumstances .
1511	If you use a credit card to pay a deposit for goods or services costing more than   Â£100 ,  you normally have more protection .
1512	See pages 42 - 43 .
1513	If you use certain other types of credit such as a linked credit agreement  ( where the trader from whom you are buying goods or services agrees to arrange your loan with a finance company )  ,  any deposit you have paid will be refundable if the credit agreement is not accepted by the finance company .
1514	Guarantees
1515	Guarantees give you additional rights which may be a useful back up if you have to complain .
1516	Guarantees should be clear ,  unambiguous and available for you to see before you make a purchase .
1517	With some goods you may have manufacturers' guarantees .
1518	Make sure ,  where there is a registration card for return to the manufacturer ,  that the seller has filled in details of the purchase ;  the registration may not be valid without this having been done .
1519	For the guarantee to be effective you may need to ensure that you return the registration card to a stated address .
1520	Make sure you retain the documentation supplied with the goods which tells you how to make a claim under your guarantee .
1521	If you buy goods ,  such as a television ,  cooker or washing machine ,  you may be offered an extended guarantee or warranty  -  but you may have to pay extra for it .
1522	Think carefully about the value for money offered by an extended warranty ;  it is likely to be expensive compared with the amount you would ,  in normal circumstances ,  pay out in repair costs .
1523	If ,  however ,  you do decide you want to buy one ,  check the wording carefully .
1524	Make sure you know exactly what it does and does not cover before you sign .
1525	Prices vary considerably and it is well worth shopping around .
1526	Do not choose a firm just because it guarantees its services .
1527	A ten - year guarantee for a new extension to your house may be worthless if the firm goes out of business .
1528	Insurance - backed guarantee schemes ,  however ,  are available through some trade associations to cover building work .
1529	For long - term schemes make sure that the insurance covers the same period as the guarantee .
1530	Guarantees cannot legally be used to exclude or limit a shop's or dealer's liability for selling goods that are defective or do not correspond with their description .
1531	Exclusion clauses
1532	Some traders may try to escape their responsibilities under contracts by using exclusion clauses ,  for instance saying they accept no liability for loss or damage .
1533	If an exclusion clause is unfair ,  it is legally void and cannot be used against you .
1534	Generally ,  only a court can decide if a contract term is unfair .
1535	But any exclusion of liability ,  whether in a contract term or on a notice ,  is always void if it is used for the purpose of evading liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence .
1536	Also ,  a trader selling goods cannot exclude liability for a breach of your statutory rights  ( see pages 9 - 10 )   -  for instance ,  by displaying a sign saying 'No refunds given' .  An attempt to do this is an offence .
1537	Similar statements about services  -  for example 'No responsibility for loss or damage to garments ,  however caused' on the back of a dry cleaning ticket  -  are not illegal .
1538	But they are not enforceable if a court finds them unfair .
1539	See pages 19 - 20 about unfair terms generally .
1540	Doorstep selling
1541	When a doorstep seller calls on you do not sign or commit yourself to anything until you have had time to think matters over and compare prices with other companies .
1542	The seller may offer you a 'special' discount ,  'free' gift or other incentive if you agree to sign immediately .
1543	Do not feel pressured by this kind of offer .
1544	If you sign an agreement at home or agree to buy something costing more than   Â£35 from a seller who calls uninvited ,  you will have seven days in which to cancel the deal .
1545	If a seller contacts you ,  either by phone or by personal visit ,  without your prior consent ,  and then offers to visit ,  you will still have seven days to cancel any agreement you sign during the subsequent visit .
1546	( There are some exceptions to this :  for example ,  perishable goods and home extensions )  .
1547	If you have cancellation rights these must be given to you in writing .
1548	A seller who enters into a contract with you without advising you in writing of these rights will have committed an offence .
1549	If you have specifically asked a seller to visit you at home ,  you may not have the right to cancel
1550	Be careful not to sign any document agreeing to a sales visit under the guise of taking part in a street survey ,  responding to a prize draw ,  an advertisement or other ruse .
1551	But if during a visit that takes place without your prior consent you sign such a document ,  you will still retain your right to cancel any agreement made during a subsequent visit ,  and the seller must inform you ,  in writing ,  of your cancellation rights .
1552	If you buy anything costing more than   Â£50 on credit you can cancel whether you invited the trader to call or not ,  provided you discuss the deal face to face with the seller and you sign away from the seller's business premises .
1553	See pages 38 - 43 .
1554	There is a code of practice covering doorstep and party plan selling .
1555	This offers the additional benefit to consumers of a 14 day cooling - off period on most goods sold by members of the Direct Selling Association .
1556	The address is on page 91 .
1557	If you want to cancel ,  act quickly .
1558	Send letters by recorded / special delivery so you have confirmation of the delivery .
1559	It may be a good idea to send your letter by fax ,  but make sure you follow it up by sending the original copy by post .
1560	Auctions
1561	Take care if you buy at an auction .
1562	Auctioneers ,  unlike other sellers ,  can refuse to accept responsibility for the quality of the goods they auction .
1563	Look out for exclusion clauses and read notices and catalogues carefully .
1564	Note any conditions of sale ,  such as buyers' premium ,  terms and method of payment ,  deposits ,  and time limits for removal of goods .
1565	You cannot back out of the deal once the hammer has fallen .
1566	Secondhand goods
1567	When you buy secondhand goods from a trader ,  you have the same rights as when buying new ones ,  but you must take into account that secondhand will not be of the same quality as brand new .
1568	You can ,  however ,  still claim your money back or the cost of repairs if goods are faulty ,  unless the faults are a matter of the wear and tear to be expected with secondhand goods ,  or were pointed out to you ,  or were obvious when you agreed to buy the goods .
1569	Private sales
1570	If you buy goods privately  -  perhaps through an advertisement in the local paper  -  you have fewer rights than when you buy from a trader .
1571	Privately bought goods do not have to be free of faults ,  but they must be as described .
1572	For example ,  a leather coat should not be plastic ,  and full length curtains must not be half length .
1573	The rule is 'buyer beware' ,  so make sure you check that you are getting a good buy .
1574	If the seller says anything misleading about the condition of the goods ,  and you buy on the basis of what is said ,  then you will be able to seek a legal remedy if the goods turn out differently .
1575	But ,  in practice ,  this could be difficult to enforce .
1576	So it is a good idea to take someone with you when buying privately ,  to act as a witness .
1577	You should also ask for a written description of the goods .
1578	Beware of traders who pose as private sellers ,  perhaps at a car boot sale or through a small advertisement .
1579	This practice is illegal and takes advantage of the fact that you have fewer rights when you buy from a private seller .
1580	If the goods you buy are faulty and you suspect the seller was not trading privately  -  for example ,  you see lots of small advertisements with the same telephone number or the seller insists on meeting you at your home  -  contact your local trading standards department which should be able to tell you if the person is a trader and not a private seller .
1581	If the person is a trader ,  your statutory rights will then apply .
1582	The trading standards department can also take action to stop the trader posing as a private seller .
1583	Some problem sectors
1584	Buying new and used cars
1585	Decide on what you want and how much you can afford .
1586	Add on estimates of running costs ,  insurance ,  tax ,  MOT ,  petrol ,  repairs and servicing .
1587	If you are taking out a loan ,  add on the repayments .
1588	Look at car magazines to see what is available for the price you want to pay ,  and check the value of any car you want to trade in .
1589	Shop around and see what various dealers have on offer in your price range .
1590	Look for a reputable dealer  -  ask the advice of friends and look for a trade association sign .
1591	This should mean that the dealer follows the requirements of the Code of Practice for the Motor Industry ,  which could be helpful if you have a complaint .
1592	The price
1593	Do not be afraid to haggle over the price .
1594	Some dealers offer fixed price 'no haggle' deals ,  but in general ,  most car prices are negotiable .
1595	It is up to you to negotiate the best deal .
1596	You may get a bigger discount if you pay by cash ,  but you may also be able to negotiate a discount if you arrange credit through the dealer .
1597	A dealer earns commission by arranging finance ,  so you may be able to bargain for part of the commission on the finance deal .
1598	Consider whether you are getting the best deal .
1599	If you are trading in your old car ,  make sure you know what it is worth .
1600	Ask for a cash price and weigh this up against the savings you might make by using your car as part - exchange for the one you want to buy .
1601	It's a good idea to avoid stating the price you want for your trade - in .
1602	Let the dealer offer you a price and then try to move it upwards .
1603	You must then decide whether you have a good deal .
1604	If you are not clear about any part of the deal ,  ask for an explanation .
1605	Get it in writing if you are still not happy .
1606	Once everything has been discussed ,  do not be afraid to say you want time to think about it or to walk away if the deal is not right for you .
1607	Buying a new car
1608	It is always worth shopping around .
1609	Look at car magazines ,  visit showrooms and talk to dealers .
1610	Do not just go into one showroom and accept what is on offer .
1611	Discounts may be available ,  particularly on the less popular models ,  but it is up to you to haggle and get the price down as much as you can .
1612	If you are willing to buy 'off the shelf' ,  without added extras and special requirements ,  you are more likely to get a better discount .
1613	You need to make sure you know what items are offered as options and what are included as standard on the car .
1614	The final price will usually reflect the number of options you want on the car .
1615	There may be offers included with the car such as insurance or extended warranties .
1616	Some manufacturers are also willing to replace or offer refunds on new cars provided they are returned within a certain time of mileage limit .
1617	You will need to consider how much these offers are worth to you when you are deciding whether you are getting a good deal .
1618	Buying a used car from a dealer
1619	When you go to a garage ,  take a friend for a second opinion ,  preferably one who knows about cars .
1620	Find out as much as you can about the car .
1621	Is the mileage guaranteed ?
1622	Some unscrupulous dealers alter the mileage reading so that it shows a lower figure than has actually been covered  ( for example ,  40 , 000 instead of 80 , 000 )  .
1623	This is called 'clocking' .
1624	Selling a car with a false mileage is illegal .
1625	Your dealer may have access to a database of vehicle mileages .
1626	Ask if any check has been made .
1627	You could ask to see the vehicle registration document and contact the last owner to check the mileage .
1628	The vehicle registration document ,  however ,  shows the 'keeper' and not the owner of the car ;  while this will be the same person in most cases ,  you may find the keeper was a company rather than a person .
1629	If the car is more than three years old ,  it must have an MOT certificate and this must show the mileage at the time of the last test .
1630	You could ask to see this too .
1631	For a fee ,  you could also check with a company which provides information on mileage  ( as well as outstanding credit agreements ,  accident - damaged and stolen vehicles )  .
1632	Check motoring magazines for addresses .
1633	Ask the dealer about the history of the car .
1634	A good garage will check that its cars are not stolen property ,  insurance company write - offs that have been repaired ,  or subject to outstanding hire purchase agreements .
1635	In fact ,  a reputable dealer should be pleased to confirm the car's history to a potential buyer .
1636	Beware a dealer who is cagey about a car's history .
1637	Inspect a car thoroughly in daylight and take it for a test drive .
1638	Car magazines often provide a range of advice on what to look and listen for when on a test drive .
1639	Is the dealer content to have the car tested by the AA or RAC before you buy ?
1640	If not ,  walk away .
1641	If the car has already been inspected ,  ask to see the report .
1642	If you decide you want the car ,  make sure any deposit you pay is subject to survey ,  so that it is returnable in case any AA / RAC report says you should not buy .
1643	If there is a warranty ,  what does it include  ( and exclude )  ,  and will you have to pay extra for it ?
1644	Buying a used car privately
1645	If you buy privately ,  you should expect to pay less as the seller does not have the expenses of a dealer .
1646	But you have fewer rights than when you buy from a trader ,  so take extra care .
1647	Also ,  some dealers try to cheat by pretending to be private sellers .
1648	See pages 57 - 59 on private sales .
1649	Does the seller really own the car ?
1650	It may still be subject to an unsettled hire purchase agreement or have been stolen .
1651	Check the name on the vehicle registration document ;  although this will only show the name of the keeper and not the owner of the car ,  it is still useful to check .
1652	Check the MOT certificate if the car is more than three years old .
1653	Ask for proof of identity .
1654	Ask for proof of identity . Inspect the car at the seller's home in daylight and satisfy yourself that the seller lives there .
1655	Ask for a test drive ,  but be very careful to ensure that you are covered by your own insurance to drive another person's car .
1656	Be wary of relying on the seller's assurance that the car is insured for you to drive .
1657	Have the car checked thoroughly by someone who knows what they are doing  -  for example ,  the AA or RAC .
1658	You cannot complain later if there is a fault you did not see or identify ,  unless there was misrepresentation .
1659	If the car is still under an extended warranty from the manufacturer ,  check that the owner has had the car regularly serviced according to the warranty conditions .
1660	There will be a service record book in which servicing details should have been recorded .
1661	An extended warranty is unlikely to be valid if servicing has not been carried out properly .
1662	Car auctions
1663	If you are looking for a bargain at an auction ,  make sure you know what you are doing .
1664	Go as a spectator first and see what happens .
1665	If possible ,  take an expert with you if you do not know much about cars .
1666	Study the auctioneer's conditions of business .
1667	You buy as seen and therefore have fewer rights of redress other than as set out in the conditions of sale .
1668	You have little opportunity to check the past history and mechanical condition of the car .
1669	Be extra careful if you are buying from a temporary auction centre .
1670	Would you be able to contact the auctioneer after the sale ?
1671	Car repair and servicing
1672	You will probably have to rely on a garage to keep your car in good repair and properly serviced .
1673	With a little forethought ,  you can avoid some of the possible pitfalls .
1674	It is best to do it in writing .
1675	If the car is in for a regular service ,  make sure you know what this include .
1676	Tell the garage if you want the manufacturer's recommended service carried out ,  and agree between you whether any items can be left out .
1677	Bear in mind that if you do have items left out it may invalidate any warranty .
1678	Get a quotation  ( a firm price )  ,  or at least an estimate  ( an informed guess )  ,  preferably in writing ,  for the work you want done .
1679	Check whether the costs for labour ,  parts and VAT are all included .
1680	Ask if workmanship and parts are guaranteed .
1681	Find out how long the job will take or agree on a set time for collection ,  and check how the garage will want you to pay the bill .
1682	Leave a telephone number and tell the garage to ask for your permission to carry on if the cost is likely to exceed the estimated cost ,  or if a further problem is identified .
1683	Once the job is finished ,  get a detailed invoice listing all work carried out ,  showing parts and labour costs .
1684	If you are faced with a sky - high bill or think the garage has done a bad job ,  talk to the manager straight away .
1685	If the problem cannot be resolved ,  you will probably still have to pay the disputed bill to get your car back
1686	Give the garage a letter ,  detailing your complaint ,  saying that you are dissatisfied and that payment is made 'without prejudice' .
1687	This will ensure that the trader cannot say in court that you accepted the repair was satisfactory because you paid the bill .
1688	See page  9 - 12 for how to complain .
1689	Furniture and furnishings
1690	If you are buying furniture ,  shop around and compare goods and prices to get the best deal .
1691	Get information from leaflets ,  catalogues and labels .
1692	Check that upholstered furniture carries a label stating that it meets fire safety requirements .
1693	Do not be afraid to test the goods .
1694	If you are buying a bed ,  lie on it for a time to see that it is comfortable .
1695	If you are getting carpet fitted ,  check that the colour and design correspond with the sample you chose and that ,  when laid ,  the roll of carpet delivered is not faded or flawed .
1696	Do not pay the whole cost until all the work has been done to your satisfaction .
1697	Furniture often has to be ordered and you may have to pay a deposit .
1698	Check that you know exactly how much you will have to pay for the goods when they arrive .
1699	For more on deposits ,  see pages 49 - 50 ,  and for advice on taking delivery of goods on order ,  see pages 43 - 44 .
1700	Some manufacturers and retailers in the furniture and carpet industries subscribe to the Qualitas Code of Practice .
1701	Traders who endorse should display a logo with the word 'Qualitas' on it .  Similarly ,  furniture produced by the manufacturers who subscribe to the code should be labelled with the Qualitas logo .
1702	All Qualitas members are pledged to repair ,  replace or make a refund to consumers for faulty or damaged goods ,  and to deal with complaints speedily and sympathetically .
1703	If you have a complaint
1704	Direct your complaint to the trader who sold you the goods .
1705	Follow the suggested procedure for complaints on page 22 .
1706	If you have made every effort to resolve the matter with the trader and it is more than three months since you first made your complaint ,  you can refer the matter to the Qualitas national conciliation service ,  if the trader is a member of the association .
1707	The conciliation service is independent .
1708	The conciliator ,  whose decisions are binding on the retailer ,  will try to settle the matter to everyone's satisfaction .
1709	If you are not happy with the decision ,  you can take court action ,  using the conciliator's findings if you wish .
1710	Qualitas cannot investigate a complaint until three months have elapsed since you first made your complaint and only if you have exhausted the trader's own complaints procedure .
1711	If you cannot resolve the problem with the trader and less than three months has passed ,  seek help from your local trading standards department ,  citizens advice bureau or consumer advice centre .
1712	To help to resolve complaints ,  Qualitas also offers an independent furnishings and floor coverings inspection service ,  which is available whether or not the trader or manufacturer is a member .
1713	Electrical goods
1714	Electrical manufacturers are constantly developing their products as technology advances .
1715	But are you sure you are going to need all those extra features ?
1716	Decide exactly what you want .
1717	Look at publications like 'Which ? '  ( the magazine of the Consumers' Association )  and specialist magazines .
1718	Then shop around ,  comparing prices and after - sales service .
1719	Check whether there are any special installation requirements and the servicing and repair arrangements .
1720	Some shops are happy to deliver and install goods for no extra charge .
1721	Familiarise yourself with the instructions and controls .
1722	Some manufacturers provide telephone help lines to help sort out problems .
1723	Many home service calls made by engineers to look at new electrical products result from incorrect use of the item .
1724	Find out if there is a guarantee ,  what it covers ,  what is excluded and how long it is for .
1725	Often you will be asked if you want to buy an extended warranty .
1726	If you do ,  make sure you know what it costs ,  what it covers ,  and whether you think the peace of mind provided is worth the extra money .
1727	Check the procedures for making a claim .
1728	Will the warranty pay for repairs up front or will you have to pay first ,  and then claim the money back afterwards ?
1729	Keep details of any guarantee or warranty with your original receipt and any service or repair documents ;  they may be needed later .
1730	It is a good idea to make a note of serial numbers for future reference .
1731	Dealing with faults and repairs
1732	If a new electrical appliance does not work properly or becomes faulty ,  first of all check that you have followed the instructions properly and that it is correctly installed and wired .
1733	Telephone the shop if you are unsure .
1734	If it still does not work ,  complain .
1735	If an appliance breaks down later owing to manufacturing faults you may still be able to claim compensation from the seller ,  even if the appliance is covered by a manufacturer's guarantee .
1736	The repairer may have to examine the item to locate the fault and is entitled to charge a fee for doing this ,  so long as you know in advance .  Ask if this will be taken off the final bill .
1737	You are entitled to a repair in a reasonable time .
1738	If you feel it is taking too long ,  tell the repairer  -  preferably in writing  -  setting out a reasonable deadline .
1739	If the repairer agrees with this and the deadline is not met ,  you may be entitled to claim compensation .
1740	If you are unhappy with the repair work ,  make a complaint .
1741	Advice on complaining about goods or services is given on pages 22 - 35 .
1742	Trade associations
1743	Members of RETRA  ( Radio ,  Electrical and Television Retailers' Association )  ,  AMDEA  ( Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Electrical Appliances )  and DASA  ( Domestic Appliance Service Association )  operate to codes of practice for servicing and repairs .
1744	They should offer a service call within three working days and tell you of any minimum call - out charge .
1745	If goods have to be taken away for repair for more than 15 working days ,  RETRA members will either lend you a similar item or ,  if this is not practical ,  extend the original term of your guarantee by the time you are without use of the appliance .
1746	RETRA ,  AMDEA and DASA have special procedures for dealing with complaints .
1747	Addresses are on page 91 .
1748	Home maintenance and improvements
1749	There are always repair maintenance and improvement jobs to be done in the home .
1750	If you are not a DIY expert you will have to find a reliable contractor
1751	A few sensible precautions taken at the outset could mean the difference between money well spent or money wasted .
1752	Choosing a contractor
1753	Choose your contractor with care .
1754	Ask friends and neighbours whom they recommend and draw up a list setting out exactly what you want done .
1755	Get quotations from three or four contractors and consider them carefully .
1756	Make sure they cover everything that you require .
1757	Do not choose a contractor just because a generous guarantee is offered  -  it is no good having a ten year guarantee if the firm has gone out of business .
1758	A guarantee is an addition to your statutory rights  -  it cannot replace or remove these rights .
1759	See pages 50 - 52 for more on guarantees .
1760	Do not agree to have work done simply because someone happens to knock on your door with an offer .
1761	If you are interested ,  ask for more information and give yourself time to get estimates from other traders to compare .
1762	Get a written agreement or contract covering all the important points :  the work to be done ,  the price ,  how long the job will take .
1763	Read it carefully .
1764	If it is important to you that the work is completed by a certain date ,  make sure that a finishing date is stated in the contract ,  and that there are specific conditions to cover compensation for any delay .
1765	For larger jobs costing more than a few thousand pounds ,  you are probably better off using a standard industry contract such as the JCT Minor Works Contract .
1766	This will ,  among other things ,  specify the intervals at which payments will be made .
1767	One copy goes to the contractor and you should keep the other .
1768	If it is a large job you might be asked for stage payments for work done .
1769	Stage payments are a good way of ensuring the steady progress of the work .
1770	It is usually a good idea to retain a sum for an agreed period after the job has been completed .  This is the best way to ensure that the contractor will put right any faults .
1771	The terms should be set out in a written contract ,  however .
1772	If things go wrong
1773	Follow the suggested procedure on pages 23 - 24 for complaining about a service .
1774	Find out if the contractor belongs to a trade association and whether it offers any extra consumer protection  ( for example ,  conciliation or arbitration services )  in addition to your statutory rights .
1775	You can find the names and addresses of relevant trade associations from your local library or citizens advice bureau .
1776	Contractors who are members of trade associations will usually publicise this and will be able to supply the addresses and telephone numbers .
1777	If you are not satisfied that your complaint has been dealt with properly by the contractor or the trade association ,  you may wish to consider going to arbitration or to court .
1778	See pages 30 - 35 for details .
1779	A consumer adviser ,  solicitor or other expert can provide independent advice on the merits of your case .
1780	Holidays
1781	Holidays can be expensive ,  so it is important to think about what you want before you book .
1782	A few simple precautions will help to ensure that you are not disappointed .
1783	Choosing and paying for your holidays
1784	Choose travel agents and tour operators which belong to a trade organisation that has a code of practice .
1785	Look for ABTA  ( Association of British Travel Agents )  or AITO  ( Association of Independent Tour Operators )  on brochures or invoices .
1786	All package travel tour operators must be bonded or protect the pre - payments they hold by other specific means .
1787	This means that if the tour operator ceases trading before you travel you should get your money back .
1788	If you are already abroad ,  you should be able to carry on with your holiday and get home without any extra payments ,  although if your tour operator is not a member of ABTA or AITO and does not hold an ATOL  ( Air Travel Organiser's Licence )  you may have to pay some expenses up front ,  and get your money back after you return .
1789	Package holidays which include flights must be protected by an ATOL granted by the Civil Aviation Authority  ( CAA )  to ensure it is fit to hold a licence and is financially sound .
1790	This does not mean that the company cannot fail ,  but it is less likely to .
1791	You should look for the ATOL number in brochures and on invoices .
1792	There are advantages in paying for your holiday by credit card .
1793	If it turns out to be a disappointment because it was wrongly described or you did not get what you paid for ,  you may be able to claim against the credit card company as well as the travel agent or tour operator .
1794	This is the case even if the travel firm goes out of business before your holiday begins or while you are away .
1795	See pages 42 - 43
1796	It is a wise precaution ,  although not a legal requirement ,  to take out travel insurance .
1797	Sometimes a holiday operator has a policy of insisting that customers take out its own travel insurance .
1798	If taking out travel insurance is a condition of taking the holiday you have no right to opt out of that requirement .
1799	Making your own insurance arrangements is usually cheaper than buying standard policies offered by the operator .
1800	Check the details of any travel insurance policy very carefully .
1801	They should cover at least the following :
1802	cancellation of ,  or cutting short your holiday ;
1803	illness or injury while you are away ;
1804	loss or theft of your belongings ;
1805	delayed or missed departures ;
1806	liability for accidents to others .
1807	Make sure you know what is excluded and what procedure you would need to follow in the event of having to make a claim  ( for example ,  reporting a theft to the local police )  .
1808	Holiday problems
1809	If you have a problem whilst you are on a package holiday ,  bring it immediately to the attention of the tour operator's representative at the resort .
1810	If necessary ask for a complaint form ,  or put your complaint in writing in a separate letter .
1811	If things are not put right straight away ,  collect evidence about the problems such as photographs ,  statements from other holiday makers .
1812	Once you get home ,  check what your holiday brochure said .
1813	It is an offence for operators to misdescribe what they offer you .
1814	The contact the tour operator and send them copies of your evidence  ( always keep the originals )  .
1815	Explain what went wrong and tell them how much compensation you want .
1816	Do not give in if you are offered much less than you have asked for :  keep pressing for what you think is fair .
1817	Contact ABTA or AITO if the tour operator is a member .
1818	ABTA provides an independent arbitration service and AITO an independent dispute settlement service which you can use if you wish .
1819	Alternatively  ( or if the tour operator is not a member of ABTA or AITO )  you can take your case to the County Court  ( or Sheriff Court in Scotland )  under the small claims procedure .
1820	See pages 30 - 35 for more on arbitration and going to court ,  and where to get help .
1821	Timeshare
1822	Be careful  -  some companies use dubious tactics to sell timeshare .
1823	For example ,  you may be offered a prize or a gift as an inducement to attend a presentation where you will be under a lot of pressure to sign on the spot .
1824	Unless you are seriously considering buying from the company concerned ,  do not go .
1825	If you sign a timeshare contract in the United Kingdom ,  you have a cooling - off period of 14 days in which you can cancel the contract  ( and any related credit agreement )  and get your money back .
1826	If you sign a timeshare contract abroad ,  in many countries the cooling - off period is 10 days but you do not have to pay any deposit .
1827	If you are uncertain about your position you should not sign but wait until you get home and seek legal advice .
1828	If you buy timeshare and you find you have not got what you paid for ,  you may still be able to get your money back if you placed the deposit using a credit card .
1829	See pages 42 - 43 .
1830	This does not apply if you just change your mind .
1831	If something goes wrong ,  get advice straight away .
1832	Contact a solicitor or seek advice from a body such as the Timeshare Council ,  the trade association in the United Kingdom .
1833	See page 93 for the address .

1849	WHY WORK WITH CHILDREN ?
1850	Quality education ,  care and play for children from birth to age 14 makes a real difference to their lives ,  laying the foundation for all - round development in their crucial formative years and preparing them for adulthood .
1851	Thousands of children are already benefiting from the input of people like you  -  people who care about children and their future ,  who have the commitment ,  energy and enthusiasm to be positive role models ,  and who value the opportunity for a worthwhile career .
1852	You'd be playing a key role in the lives of the children you care for .
1853	Your involvement could help children develop social learning skills that would stand them in good stead throughout their lives .
1854	So why work with children ?   Because children deserve a good start .
1855	After all ,  they're our future .
1856	COULD IT BE ME ?
1857	Thousands of people are still needed nationwide to give children the best start .
1858	In fact ,  over the next three years ,  around 150 , 000 new workers are needed to meet demand .
1859	If children are to continue getting the very best quality early education ,  care and play ,  we need to draw on a wider pool of talent for these crucial jobs .
1860	If you have the right blend of skills and personal qualities ,  you could be one of them .
1861	All kinds of people work in Early Years ,  Childcare and Playwork .
1862	Children need a variety of positive role models and good influences .
1863	School leavers and students ,  adults of all ages ,  disabled people ,  people from ethnic minorities ,  men and women  -  with or without previous experience  -  all play an important part .
1864	What they have in common is their patience ,  enthusiasm ,  empathy ,  a sense of responsibility and a sense of fun !
1865	These dedicated people also need to understand that theirs is a job to be taken seriously .
1866	If you care about children ,  you like being with them ,  encouraging and learning with them ,  listening to them ,  stimulating their imagination and watching them grow ,  this could be your future .
1867	There's never been a better time to  work on Early Years ,  Childcare and Playwork .
1868	NB Please note that for all Early Years ,  Childcare and Playwork jobs you will need to undergo a police check .
1869	For further details of this and all other requirements contact the Office for Standards in Education  ( Ofsted )  ,  see page 30 for telephone number and website .
1870	" CHILDCARE'S A CAREER THAT HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE TO PLAY IN A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT .  IT'S LIKE HAVING A SECOND FAMILY  -  YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITY BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE CHILDREN .  "

1872	WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME ?
1873	You will have a respected and demanding career ,  and interesting and challenging role with the potential to change lives  -  for the better .
1874	And that's some responsibility .
1875	In return ,  the rewards are great .
1876	You'll watch children grow and gain in confidence as they learn and play .
1877	You'll share in their achievements and be there for them when they need you .
1878	You'll give them security and feel in return the trust they invest in you .
1879	Working with children often involves working with parents too ,  helping them with their child's development and enabling them to find a better balance in their lives .
1880	It often involves working as part of a team ,  training and learning day by day .
1881	You'll not only feel the difference in terms of confidence and job satisfaction  -  you'll also have the support and camaraderie that teamwork can bring .
1882	And you'll have the opportunity to work towards qualifications that have real currency in the jobs market ,  recognising your role in a child's development and enabling you to develop your own personal career  -  right up to manager level ,  if that's what you'd like .
1883	WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS ?
1884	There is variety as well as job satisfaction .
1885	For example you could work in a nursery ,  pre - school or playgroup .
1886	You could use your skills alongside a teacher in a nursery school or in a nursery class or reception class ,  enjoying involvement with children up to the age of five .
1887	You could set up as a childminder ,  based in your own home ,  or you could get involved in one of the many Playwork schemes ,  the out - of - school clubs and holiday play schemes that exist around the country ,  working with children up to the age of 14 years .
1888	You could also choose to specialise in working with children with special educational needs .
1889	What's more ,  there are opportunities for you to move from one Childcare setting to another  -  and to gain promotion and greater responsibility with experience .
1890	One thing is certain  -  you'll never be bored .

1892	" IT'S BRILLIANT TO WATCH AND ENCOURAGE AS CHILDREN DEVELOP AND GROW IN CONFIDENCE IN THE NURSERY ,  SO THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT ALL BY THE TIME THEY START SCHOOL .  "
1893	NURSERIES
1894	There are all kinds of nurseries  -  some run by voluntary or community groups ,  some by employers or local authorities .
1895	Others are privately run .
1896	There are also nursery classes attached to some primary schools .
1897	They usually provide full day care ,  education and play for children up to the age of five and are generally open from 8am to 6pm .
1898	Some also offer extended care for school - age children ,  opening at 7am in the morning until 7pm in the evening .
1899	The majority of nurseries are open weekdays all year round  ( except for Bank Holidays )   -  but some are open term - time only .
1900	So there are likely to be opportunities for you to work part - time or  - term - time to fit in with your other commitments .
1901	You'd be :  planning and organising stimulating educational and fun activities and taking care of children's personal needs  -  for food ,  washing and sleep ,  for instance .
1902	For information on training ,  see 'What experience and qualifications do I need ? ' on page 20 .
1903	PRE - SCHOOLS AND PLAYGROUPS
1904	Pre - schools and Playgroups provide Childcare ,  play and Early Years education usually for children aged between two and five .
1905	While many operate on a part - time 'sessional' basis ,  an increasing number are offering extended and full day care and holiday schemes .
1906	Both full and part - time work may be available ,  as is the possibility of term - time only work .
1907	You'd be :  planning and providing a range of play opportunities for the children ,  together with Early Years education .
1908	For information on training ,  see 'What experience and qualifications do I need ? ' on page 20 .
1909	" IF YOU CAN GIVE CHILDREN EMOTIONAL SECURITY ,  THEY WILL LEARN BETTER LATER ON  -  AND YOU WILL HAVE MADE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THEIR LIVES .  "
1910	" BEING A CHILDMINDER IS A MARVELLOUS OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE BALANCE RIGHT FOR CHILDREN ,  BUILDING THEIR SELF - ESTEEM .
1911	IT'S LIKE HAVING A SECOND FAMILY .  "
1912	CHILDMINDING
1913	Childminding is currently the most popular kind of day care chosen by parents ,  offering Childcare for babies and children of all ages ,  usually with hours that allow for greater flexibility .
1914	You'd be self - employed ,  childminding in your own home ,  so the hours you'd work and the number and ages of the children you'd care for would ,  to an extent ,  be up to you .

1933	There's a range of relevant qualifications at local colleges ,  full - time ,  part - time or day release from your work .
1934	Much of the training can take place on the job ,  where you can gain qualifications such as National Vocational Qualification  ( NVQs )  at your own pace .
1935	Financial help for training may be available from College Access funds  -  contact your local college or your Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership for details .

1962	WHAT WILL I EARN ?
1963	Pay levels are set locally ,  rather than nationally ,  and are dependent upon the setting in which you work and the number of hours you work .
1964	But the better qualified you are ,  the more experience you get and the higher your level of responsibility  -  then the higher your salary is likely to be .
1965	Contact your local Early Years Development and Childcare Partnership  -  or visit the Jobcentre  -  to find out more about opportunities and rates of pay in your area .

2013	A little reading goes a long way
2014	Helping with your children's reading
2015	Learning at Home
2016	All children need to learn to read ,  and all parents want their children to be able to read and write .
2017	The most important thing is that children learn better when they enjoy reading .
2018	By enjoying books together and sharing a love of stories from the earliest age ,  you are helping your child develop  -  and learning to read is fun !
2019	You taught your children the first things they ever knew .
2020	Young children watch what adults do and learn by copying them .
2021	Reading is no different ,  but they must want to learn to read .
2022	It will help if they can see others enjoying reading themselves .
2023	Girls ,  in particular ,  need to know that reading is important ,  and fathers and grandfathers reading to them can help .
2024	Seeing adults reading from books ,  newspapers ,  recipes or menus will make children want to read for themselves .
2025	Your child will gain a lot from spending time with you talking and listening ,  reading and writing .
2026	Most children will try hard to please you and will want to do well .
2027	Best of all ,  sharing the fun of reading is a great experience for children and adults .
2028	Who this booklet is for
2029	In this site we refer to 'your child' .
2030	In fact ,  it's aimed at grandparents ,  aunts and uncles ,  guardians ,  carers and friends  -  not just parents .
2031	First Steps
2032	Babies love words and language .
2033	They love it when you sing and read to them and tell them stories ,  poems and rhymes  -  and even small babies can enjoy books .
2034	From the start ,  the time you spend reading with your children will make books and stories come alive .
2035	Board books and bath books are often the first books children will come across .
2036	They can be treated as toys ,  but they will help them learn how to handle books ,  how to turn pages and how to enjoy the shapes ,  colours and pictures .
2037	Children often want to listen to the same story again and again .
2038	This is fine ,  as it builds confidence and familiarity with words ,  and reinforces that stories are fun .
2039	Try to share books together each day ,  and not just at bedtime .
2040	A few minutes of special ,  quiet time with a book every day is much more valuable than half an hour a week .
2041	One of the main ways in which you can help children to become readers is by sharing books and reading aloud to them .
2042	They will learn to talk about the story and pictures ,  join in the parts they know and eventually recognise the words on the page .
2043	Learning to read
2044	Most children learn to read by putting letters together that match up with the sounds that they remember hearing .
2045	They learn the sounds that letters make .
2046	They learn how letters join together to make words .
2047	Words don't just belong in books .
2048	Look around  -  you'll see them everywhere :
2049	on signs and posters ;
2050	in shop windows and newspapers ;
2051	on groceries and football shirts ;  and
2052	in the titles of TV programmes .
2053	You can help by doing the following :
2054	Singing .
2055	Rhymes help children see how letters make the same pattern in different words .
2056	Play 'odd one out games' .
2057	For example ,  which word is the odd one in a list like cat ,  mat ,  dog ,  sat ?
2058	Play 'I - spy' .
2059	It is a great way of showing that every word begins with a letter .
2060	At the shops ,  point out the names of different kinds of food as you go past them  ( for example ,  apples ,  bacon ,  and cheese )  .
2061	Encourage your child to choose a book for you to read to them .
2062	Show your child the way words go from left to right on the page by underlining them with fingers  -  yours first ,  then theirs !
2063	Don't keep them guessing for a long time if they can't say a new word  -  help them spell it out slowly using the sounds of the letters and then say it faster together .
2064	Praise your child when they work out a new word for themselves ,  or when they go back and put right a word they got wrong the first time .
2065	Help and encouragement
2066	Ask your child's teachers for advice and ideas about how you can help with reading and writing .
2067	Ask other mums and dads  ( including your own )  for tips .
2068	Remember to encourage your child every time they read or write with you .
2069	Never say children are lazy or stupid if they can't do it first time .
2070	The next step
2071	Between the ages of four and seven ,  most children learn to read ,  but even when they can read ,  you should still try to read to them as often as possible .
2072	Sharing stories with a grown - up will teach them new words and will encourage them to become better readers .
2073	Children develop their reading skills in different ways .
2074	Some may want to get every word exactly right while other children will race to the end of a story .
2075	Other children may read hesitantly .
2076	Try to respond to your child's needs and let them read at their own pace .
2077	Eventually ,  you will know in which ways your child needs more help .
2078	Some children may need to slow down and look more carefully at each word .
2079	Others will need to move the story along and not worry so much about their mistakes .
2080	If they get stuck ,  encourage them to use all the available information and everything they know to make a guess .
2081	They should look at the pictures and remember what has happened in the story .
2082	Their ability to predict and guess accurately will gradually improve .
2083	You can also help by doing the following :
2084	Make the most of books your child brings home from school .
2085	Read them ,  or parts of them yourself and talk about them with your child .
2086	Check your child is really following what they're reading by asking them to tell you the story in their own words  -  who's it about ?   What happens ?
2087	Allow your child to re - read favourite and familiar stories ,  or to hear you re - read them .
2088	Knowing a familiar book will help them notice more about the words on the page and they will start to recognise the patterns in new words and stories .
2089	Listen to stories learned by heart and encourage your child to re - tell them in their own words ,  or even act them out .
2090	Buy books as presents instead of toys .
2091	Set up a special place for books from the library or their own books .
2092	Be positive
2093	Don't panic !  Your child probably isn't the best or worst at anything at school .
2094	Don't make your child feel that reading and writing are 'special' or harder than other things they're learning .
2095	If they're struggling ,  remind them of other things they're good at  -  such as drawing or cycling or football or singing .
2096	Getting better
2097	As we have said ,  part of learning to be a better reader is being able to guess what new words mean sand how they sound .
2098	There are many ways in which you can continue to play a very important role in the development of your child's reading .
2099	You can help by doing the following :
2100	Find books about something you know they like  -  maybe animals ,  or how other people live ,  or outer space .
2101	Read a story together ,  then read it out again ,  missing out words .
2102	Get your child to fill in the blanks .
2103	A different word that means the same thing may be suggested .
2104	That's good .
2105	It shows that your child is thinking about the story and words .
2106	Help your child see that they already know the biggest part of words like play - ing ,  eat - en ,  walk - ed by breaking the word down .
2107	Write out long words and cut them into bite - sized pieces .
2108	Get your child to put the pieces back together the right way round .
2109	When your child reads and gets a word wrong ,  let them finish the line before you put them right .
2110	Children often realise what the word should be ,  go back and correct themselves .
2111	If your child doesn't know a word in a sentence ,  get them to say 'something' instead .
2112	They can often work it out from other words around it .
2113	Try to keep cool !  It's important not to get fed up if your child needs to practise things over and over again .
2114	Choosing books  -  help is at hand
2115	Choosing books for children can be a huge pleasure ,  or you might not know where to start .
2116	As members of your local library ,  you and you child will be able to borrow from a large range of books .
2117	The librarians will be able to give helpful advice to adults who want to choose books for their children .
2118	Also ,  keep your eyes open for book and storytelling events taking place in the library .
2119	Other parents may have books that have been popular ,  and many children will tell their friends about their favourite books
2120	Learning to write
2121	Children are often eager to write .
2122	Writing often follows on from drawing and from the child's reading .
2123	Children like to be able to write their names ,  to label drawings or to write a story to go with a picture .
2124	They learn about reading through their writing ,  having to think about the sound and how words look .
2125	When they see that writing is a way of telling someone something ,  just like talking ,  they usually want to try it for themselves .
2126	You can help them by doing the following :
2127	Get young children used to making the shapes of letters by joining dots or using a pen to go over shapes you've drawn in pencil .
2128	At the beginning ,  don't worry too much about untidy writing .
2129	You don't want to put them off having fun when they're learning .
2130	Don't worry if your child crosses words out when they're writing .
2131	Lots of children try out different spellings until they feel a word looks right .
2132	Get them to try out words on scrap paper ,  then put the word in its proper place when they are happy with it .
2133	Write a story that your child has told you .
2134	They can learn from watching you write and can help by suggesting letters and spellings .
2135	Help them to make their own labels ,  notices ,  cards and books .
2136	If they want to write a story ,  help them to think of what it's about ,  what happens and how it ends .
2137	Ask questions about the characters in the story .
2138	You  ( or they )  could write down some notes to help them remember all their ideas .
2139	Explain that they need different words to write about the past  ( we walked to the shops yesterday )  ,  present  ( today I am here )  and future  ( tomorrow I will go swimming )  .
2140	Use lower case rather than capitals .
2141	Children find it easier to practise the patterns of the letters that way .
2142	Word banks
2143	You can make a word box filled with words your child uses most and which you can add new words to .
2144	Or ,  your child can make their own lists of common ,  popular ,  difficult and new words .
2145	Spelling
2146	Lots of children find spelling hard .
2147	If it gets in the way of your child's enjoyment of reading and writing ,  there are ways you can help using everyday items .
2148	You can help them by doing the following :
2149	Spell out words with fridge magnets ,  or letter tiles from word games .
2150	Take some letters out and get your child to put the right ones back in the right places .
2151	Play games with lists of words .
2152	Can they put them in alphabetical order using the first letter of a word  ( for example ,  cat ,  fat ,  hat ,  mat and sat )  ?
2153	Or can they do this by the second letter  ( for example ,  bag ,  beg ,  big ,  bog and bug )  ?
2154	Give them old newspapers or magazines to play word - finding games  -  for example ,  get them to highlight or draw a circle round every word that ends with 'ing' ,  or every word beginning with 't' .
2155	Think up harder versions as your child learns more ! Draw or cut out pictures of things that have only one letter different  ( like 'pen' and 'pin' )  to help them get used to how different vowels  ( a , e , i , o , u )  work .
2156	Use a mirror so your child can see how their mouth moves when saying letters that can easily get mixed up when they write them down ,  like 'm' and 'w' ,  or 'p' and 'g' .
2157	Make up games to help your child see the difference between words like 'tap' and 'tape' or 'hop' and 'hope' where the last letter changes the way you say the whole word .
2158	Get them to play at rearranging letters to make other words  ( anagrams )  out of their name ,  or other words they know .
2159	Dictionaries
2160	Practice looking up words together and sharing the dictionary .
2161	Children need help in looking up words ,  following alphabetical order and guessing how a word may start .
2162	There are many good dictionaries written specially for children .
2163	Words are everywhere
2164	Some more ideas to help your child to read when you haven't got a book .
2165	Going to the shops
2166	Some shops still have a sign over the door that says what they sell .
2167	Can your child put the words together with what's in the window  ( hairdressers ,  shoes ,  and so on )  ?
2168	Look in the papers
2169	If your child recognises a famous face  ( for example ,  a footballer or a TV star )  it will make them want to try to read the story .
2170	In the streets
2171	You'll see advertising posters and place names .
2172	In the shops
2173	Your child can help you find things in the supermarket by reading out what's in the aisles .
2174	Videos
2175	Video boxes usually tell you the story .
2176	Get your child to read what's on the box as well as just watching the film .
2177	On a bus or train trip
2178	Place names on the front of the bus or train ,  posters on the bus or tube .
2179	Even the ticket is worth reading to a child !
2180	Look at holiday brochures together  -  Help your child read about other places .
2181	Unpacking the shopping
2182	Your child can read the words on your groceries  ( for example ,  corn flakes ,  tea bags ,  and burgers )  while helping you put things away .
2183	Some CDs and tapes have song words printed on them
2184	Your child will probably find it easier to follow words if they hear them at the same time .
2185	You can help by doing the following :
2186	Whenever you're reading together ,  make sure your child feels OK and is comfortable .
2187	Use books with pictures ,  and later ,  with pictures and words .
2188	Picture books help children match the pictures to the words .
2189	Don't cover up the pictures to make your child 'read properly' .
2190	Write titles under pictures  ( for example ,  dog ,  mummy ,  house )  to show them that words belong to things .
2191	You can also stick labels on things at home  -  or when they're older get them to do it themselves  ( for example ,  door ,  cup )  .
2192	Start with simple words .
2193	No book handy ?  Don't worry !
2194	Think about other ways you can use the word you see all around you to help your child become a better reader .
2195	You probably won't run out of ideas !

2202	Use your finger  ( and hers )  to help her read from left to right .
2203	3 My nephew muddles up i and e when he reads .
2204	Play games with the two letters  -  put things that begin with the letter 'i' in one box ,  and 'e' in another ,  or pictures of things like 'pin' and 'pen' and play mixing - up and sorting games with them .
2205	4 My daughter seems to do nothing but crosswords and word puzzles .
2206	Anything involving words and letters helps with reading and writing skills .
2207	5 My son is left - handed .
2208	Will this be a problem ?
2209	No ,  this won't be a problem but he may need extra help .
2210	Try getting him to hold the paper at an angle so it slopes towards his writing hand .
2211	He may need to hold the pen slightly higher .
2212	You can talk to your son's teacher about this as well .
2213	6 Would paper with lines help my son's messy writing ?
2214	Lines will help him keep his writing straight and easier to read .
2215	Use lines with wide spaces to start with .
2216	7 My daughter has started to write but her letters seem so awkward .
2217	What can I do ?
2218	Writing large letters will help her feel the shape as she makes them .
2219	Try felt - tip pens on big sheets of paper .
2220	Don't put her off writing  -  helping her get what she wants to say down on paper is as important as neatness .
2221	8 My grandson loves writing stories ,  but gets confused and bored and loses the point .
2222	Talk to him about his ideas for the story  -  the beginning ,  characters ,  places ,  main events ,  and how it ends .
2223	Help him write it down to use as a guide .
2224	9 My son crosses words out and has several tries before getting it right .
2225	Does this matter ?
2226	No ,  have a spare sheet of paper for him to try out spellings on ,  or let him write in pencil so he can rub it out if he needs to .
2227	10 If my daughter doesn't know a word in her reading book ,  should I tell her ?
2228	Yes ,  but not until she has had chance to work it out or read to the end of the sentence .
2229	Remember the three Ps :
2230	pause  -  give her time to work it out ;
2231	prompt  -  look for something in the word she knows ,  like the first letter ;
2232	and praise  -  tell her when she's been successful .
2233	11 My son muddles up b and d when he's reading or writing .
2234	Does it matter ?
2235	Lots of children get letters that look alike ,  such as 'p' and 'g' ,  'm' and 'w' ,  'n' and 'u' ,  confused .
2236	Concentrate on getting one letter right at a time .
2237	Help him listen to the different sounds and feel how he makes them  -  lips together for 'b' ,  or apart for 'd' .

2270	Learning to Read and Write at Home and at School
2271	Parents as partners
2272	This leaflet is for parents of children in infant ,  primary and junior schools .
2273	We are sending it to you as part of the National Literacy Strategy .
2274	This national government initiative aims to raise standards of reading and writing for all children .
2275	Of course ,  parents are very important partners in helping children with reading and writing .
2276	This leaflet :
2277	sets out some of the main things we know about how children learn to read and write
2278	describes ways that reading and writing are taught in schools
2279	explains why lessons are planned in this way
2280	asks for your help in supporting reading and writing at home
2281	Learning to read and write
2282	Reading ,  writing ,  talking and listening are a key part of what children learn in their first years at school .
2283	Your child's teacher will build on the experiences they bring with them to school .
2284	All the learning they do at home with you and at school with their teachers ,  helps children to :
2285	want to read
2286	enjoy talking about what they read and telling us what they think
2287	find things out by reading  -  from stories ,  information books ,  catalogues or newspapers  .  .  .
2288	learn new words
2289	get their ideas across in writing
2290	understand that people write in different ways for different reasons
2291	spell words correctly and write clearly
2292	read and write confidently
2293	Children learn to read best when they have many ways of working out the meaning .
2294	These are like searchlights .
2295	The more lights that are turned on ,  the easier it is for them to read .
2296	The 'lights' include :
2297	the sounds of letters
2298	the shapes of letters and words  ( that they recognise by sight )
2299	the meaning  ( what will come next .  .  .  )
2300	The more opportunities children have ,  at school and at home ,  to enjoy reading ,  the sooner they begin to be confident about it .
2301	Reading and writing at school
2302	Your child may tell you about the literacy hour ,  and what happens in it .
2303	All the time in the literacy hour is spent on reading and writing .
2304	There is a literacy hour every day of the week .
2305	It is usually divided into four parts .
2306	Whole class about 10 minutes reporting back and thinking about what has been learned
2307	Whole class about 15 minutes shared reading or writing
2308	Small groups about 20 minutes guided reading or writing
2309	Whole class about 15 minutes word work ,  sentence work
2310	Whole class  -  shared reading and writing
2311	Early reading and writing
2312	With young children the teacher works with the whole class for the first half hour .
2313	He or she may begin by reading with all the children ,  using a 'big book' .
2314	First she will read the book aloud ,  and point to the words and pictures .
2315	Then she will read it again and the children will join in .
2316	The teacher will ask questions and encourage the children to think about what they read .
2317	Questions might be :
2318	What do you think will happen next ?
2319	Where is the title of the book ?
2320	What does that word mean ?
2321	Why was that part funny ?
2322	Can you tell us about something funny that happened to you ?
2323	What do you think it will be about ?
2324	to know that the words go from left to right
2325	to see where one word ends and the next word begins
2326	to recognise letters and words
2327	to hear the sounds of letters
2328	to recognise words or sounds that rhyme
2329	to know about full stops ,  commas and other punctuation .
2330	Group work
2331	In the next part of the hour ,  the class is split up into groups of four to six children .
2332	They may work as a group or in pairs .
2333	Each day the teacher works with one or two different groups .
2334	When they are reading ,  all the children have copies of the same book .
2335	Because the other children are taught how to work independently ,  the teacher can give full attention to the group he or she is teaching .
2336	Whole group
2337	For the last part of the literacy hour the teacher works with the whole class again .
2338	She asks the children to discuss what they have been doing and review what they have learned .
2339	Why have a literacy hour ?
2340	Because reading and writing are so important ,  it makes sense to give them a set time ,  every day .
2341	The teacher can teach all the children some of the main points they need to learn .
2342	The children also learn from listening to one another .
2343	Schools that are trying the literacy hour find it works well and leads to good improvements in children's reading and writing .
2344	When will the teacher hear my child read ?
2345	There are many times in the literacy hour and in other lessons when teachers will hear children reading and see how they are getting on .
2346	In the 'group work' time ,  when the teacher has just four to six children ,  he will work with your child and hear them reading .
2347	What do older children do in the literacy hour ?
2348	As children become independent readers and writers ,  they still spend an hour every day on reading and writing .
2349	They work on more complex books .
2350	Each term they read different kinds of books :  information books ,  legends ,  stories ,  poems ,  plays and diaries .
2351	They learn to spell more difficult words .
2352	They learn how sentences and paragraphs are put together .
2353	They draft and edit their writing .
2354	This might be a news article ,  a set of instructions ,  a description ,  a letter or a story .
2355	Will my child learn reading and writing at other times ?
2356	Yes .
2357	They use their reading and writing in other lessons .
2358	And there are times when they can do more reading ,  or finish a piece of writing .
2359	How will I know what progress my child is making ?
2360	Your child's teacher will talk with you about your child's progress in reading and writing .
2361	She will also set targets .
2362	For example ,  for a young child this might be :
2363	to learn five letters of the alphabet
2364	to leave spaces between words
2365	to tell the story in their own words .
2366	For an older child it might be :
2367	to explain what a person in a story is like
2368	to write in paragraphs
2369	to learn how to spell a number of words
2370	to take notes as they watch a video .
2371	Your child's school will let you know what your child is working towards ,  and ask you to help by :
2372	practising with them to help them reach their target
2373	praising them when they reach it .
2374	Your child's teacher will also let you know about other ways you can help .
2375	She may :
2376	send books home and ask you to read them with your child
2377	ask parents to help in school
2378	hold meetings or courses for parents who want to know more
2379	explain the school's homework policy and ask for your support
2380	Reading and Writing at Home
2381	Young children learn a great deal from you about reading and writing ,  before they start school .
2382	They learn to talk and listen to what you say .
2383	They learn about looking at books ,  asking questions about the story and starting to write .
2384	When they go to school ,  the help you give them is just as important .
2385	The more chances your child has to enjoy reading and writing at home ,  the better .
2386	Little and often works well .
2387	With young children it helps to :
2388	read stories together
2389	talk about the story together
2390	let them see you reading and writing
2391	make shopping lists together
2392	help them to read signs and labels when you're out together
2393	visit the public library
2394	share songs and rhymes
2395	listen to tapes of books and songs
2396	talk about TV programmes .
2397	If I am listening to my child read ,  and they are stuck on a word ,  what should I do ?
2398	You could :
2399	let them read on  -  then they may be able to work out the word
2400	point to a picture ,  if this helps them with the meaning
2401	give them the first or last sound and see if they can read the word
2402	read the word for them .
2403	You could read along with them .
2404	If they are stuck ,  first :
2405	pause ,  then
2406	prompt ,  then ,
2407	praise .
2408	Encourage them to talk about the ideas in the story .
2409	With older children it helps to :
2410	read with them and talk about the ideas  -  in information books ,  stories ,  newspapers or magazines about hobbies ,  music ,  TV ,  sport
2411	encourage them to read 'everyday' print  -  in DIY manuals ,  TV guides ,  catalogues
2412	give them plenty of chances for writing  -  in notebooks ,  diaries ,  scrapbooks ,  or on a computer
2413	help them to notice the spellings of common words  ( because ,  many )  and encourage them to look at words ,  check and remember how words that they use often are spelt .
2414	Help at home gives children the best start in reading and writing
2415	Teaching Children Road Safety
2416	A guide for parents
2417	Parents !
2418	Your child's best road safety teacher is you
2419	Why ?
2420	Because basic road safety can best be taught in the street .
2421	Your child is out and about with you .
2422	He or she will follow your example ,  good or bad
2423	Please don't wait for the school to teach your child road safety .
2424	Teach them the basic skills yourself .
2425	These are the facts :
2426	over 140 children are killed and 4 , 200 seriously injured on our roads every year while walking or cycling ;
2427	most serious road accidents involving children walking and cycling happen close to home ,  on residential roads carrying only light traffic ;
2428	and those aged 12 - 15 are the most likely to be killed or seriously injured .
2429	Although they know the Green Cross Code they don't always apply it .
2430	What can you do ?
2431	You can do a lot to protect your child .
2432	This leaflet tells you the best way to teach the skills your child needs .
2433	Make sure that grandparents ,  childminders ,  or anyone looking after your child sets the same example as you do .
2434	Remember that children develop at different rates .
2435	Only you can decide when your child is ready to move from one stage to the next .
2436	Ages 1 to 4 :  Protect your Child
2437	Children under five cannot cope with traffic .
2438	Never let them out alone or even with an older child .
2439	Choose somewhere safe for them to play ;  never on the pavement or in the road ,  however quiet .
2440	If there is nowhere else for them to go ,  make sure an adult looks after them .
2441	When you go out ,  make sure your child walks on the side of the pavement away from the traffic ,  either holding your hand ,  on reins or in a buggy or pushchair .
2442	Never allow your child to ride a bike on the road even if you are close by .
2443	Set a good example .
2444	Explain what traffic is .
2445	Tell your child about stopping at the kerb ,  looking and listening for traffic before crossing .
2446	Explain the difference between the road and the pavement  -  the road is for traffic and the pavement for people .
2447	Explain that sometimes traffic crosses the pavement ,  so your child must always watch out .
2448	Every child should learn about traffic before going to school .
2449	Ask the road safety officer at your local council offices if they run a traffic club or other road safety programme for children under five .
2450	Ages 5 to 6 :  Teaching your child
2451	Whenever you take your child out walking ,  tell them what you are doing and why .
2452	Teach the main points of the Green Cross Code :
2453	STOP !  LOOK !  LISTEN !
2454	These are the first points to learn .
2455	See page 14 for the full Code .
2456	Practise on quiet roads near home .
2457	First ,  show what to do .
2458	Then let your child lead you across .
2459	Finally ,  let him or her cross while you wait behind ,  watching carefully .
2460	At this age ,  children are not ready to cross alone .
2461	Make sure an adult is always with them when they cross .
2462	The risk of a road accident rises when children start school .
2463	Most happen when children are not with an adult .
2464	Why not set up a rota with two or three other parents and share taking the children to and from school ?
2465	Take the safest route to school ,  crossing roads at the safest place and explaining why .
2466	Where there is a crossing use it .
2467	Ages 7 to 9 :  Now for the Green Cross Code
2468	Explain the rules of the Green Cross Code ,  shown on page 14 .
2469	When you are sure your child knows and understands them ,  let him or her use them while crossing the quiet roads where you have been practising .
2470	Watch and test before letting your child cross quiet roads alone .
2471	Later ,  start to practise crossing busier roads together .
2472	Do this many ,  many times before you let your child cross alone .
2473	Many children cannot judge how fast vehicles are going or how far away they are .
2474	The age when they can use and understand the Green Cross Code is different for each child .
2475	Children learn by example ,  so when walking with children always use the Green Cross Code .
2476	Being seen
2477	Make sure your child can be easily seen .
2478	Bright or fluorescent clothes show up best by day ,  especially in dull or misty weather ,  but fluorescent clothing doesn't work after dark .
2479	Reflective material does work well and shows up in car headlights .
2480	Explain to your child why they should always wear something bright ,  especially at night .
2481	Ages 10 to 15 :  Help them to think for themselves
2482	This is the age when children need to get more and more independence .
2483	They may also have longer journeys to school and to see friends .
2484	Keep talking to your child about the dangers of traffic .
2485	Point out people who are endangering themselves or others .
2486	Check the routes to school and discuss any dangers together .
2487	Get your child to practise judging the speed and distance of approaching vehicles on a busy road and identifying safe gaps .
2488	Stress that they should never blindly follow others across the road .
2489	They must always think for themselves .
2490	Children between 12 and 15 are most at risk of being killed or seriously injured .
2491	Many of them think they 'know it all' .
2492	It's up to you to make them take road safety seriously .
2493	Road safety at school
2494	Ask your child's teacher or a school governor about road safety education at school ,  and what cycle training courses are available .
2495	Encourage your child to take one .
2496	Make sure your child always wears a cycle helmet and wear one yourself if you ride a bike .
2497	How to use a crossing
2498	1 .  Stop at the kerb at the crossing .
2499	Wait for the traffic to stop .
2500	If there is a button ,  press it and wait for the green man .
2501	2 .  When the traffic has stopped ,  walk across ,  but keep looking and listening .
2502	Always cross on the stripes ,  or between the studs on a crossing with a red and green man .
2503	Don't cross on the zig - zag markings ,  as many accidents happen close to crossings .
2504	3 .  If there is an island in the middle of the crossing treat each half of the road as a separate crossing .
2505	Stop at the island and wait for the traffic on the other side to stop before you continue .
2506	In the car
2507	Teach your child to be a good passenger .
2508	Explain that they mustn't distract the driver .
2509	Use a child restraint  ( car seat )  or seat belt that is right for your child's size .
2510	This will help to protect them from serious injury .
2511	The law says that you should not carry an unrestrained child in the front seat of any vehicle and that child restraints and seat belts must be used in the back if they are available .
2512	WARNING :
2513	It is not safe to carry a child on your lap or to carry two people in one seat belt .
2514	Never use a rear facing child restraint in the front seat of a car fitted with a passenger air bag .
2515	For children of 13 and under it is the driver's responsibility to make sure that seat belts are worn .
2516	Several different types of child restraints are available baby seats ,  child seats ,  booster seats and booster cushions .
2517	The right one depends on the weight ,  size and age of your child .
2518	All child restraints must carry the United Nations 'E' mark or BS Kitemark and should be properly installed .
2519	If you want to know more you can order a copy of the leaflet Seat belts and child restraints ,  product code T / INF / 2511 ,  from DTI - R Free Literature Service .
2520	Phone 0870 122 6236 or contact your local authority road safety officer .
2521	Th Green cross code
2522	Remember the green cross code
2523	Where there is a crossing nearby ,  use it .
2524	Otherwise choose a place where you can see clearly in all directions .
2525	Try to avoid crossing between parked cars .
2526	Move to a space where find a safe place to drivers can see you clearly .
2527	1 .  Think first
2528	Find a safe place to cross then stop
2529	2 .  Stop
2530	Stand on tke pavernent near the kerb .
2531	Stand where you can see if anything is coming .
2532	Do not get too close to the traffic .
2533	If there is no pavement ,  keep back from the edge of the road but make sure you can still see approaching traffic .
2534	3 .  Use your eyes and ears
2535	Look all around for traffic and listen .
2536	Traffic could come from  any direction .
2537	Also listen ,  because you can sometimes hear traffic before you see it .
2538	4 .  Wait 'till it's safe to cross
2539	If traffic is coming let it pass .
2540	look all around again
2541	Look all around again and listen .
2542	Do not cross until there is a safe gap in the traffic and you are certain that there is plenty of time .
2543	Remember ,  even if traffic is a long way off ,  it may be approaching very quickly .
2544	5 .  Look and listen again
2545	When there's no traffic near walk straight across the road
2546	Keep looking and listening for traffic while you cross ,  in case there is any you did not see ,  or in case other traffic appears suddenly .
2547	6 Arrive alive
2548	Keep looking and listening for traffic while you cross
2549	ASSURED SAFE CATERING
2550	A Management System for Hazard Analysis
2551	Introduction
2552	The manager of owner of each catering or food business has to be able to satisfy each customer's demands and expectations that food :
2553	arrives as ordered ;
2554	is at right temperature ;
2555	looks appetising and tastes good ;
2556	gives value for money ;
2557	but above all  -  it must be safe .
2558	Food poisoning may occur even when food has been prepared in clean kitchens if the food is not stored ,  prepared ,  cooked and served properly .
2559	Assured safe catering is a system developed for caterers and with caterers to control food safety problems .
2560	It is based upon the principles of the system used in food manufacturing sometimes called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point  ( HACCP )  .
2561	Assured safe catering looks at the catering operation step by step ,  from the selections of the ingredients right through to the serving of the food to the customer .
2562	By carefully analysing each step of the catering operation ,  anything which might affect the safety of the food is identified .
2563	You can then decide when and how to control that hazard .
2564	Assured Safe Catering helps prevent safety problems by careful planning in easy steps .
2565	Hazards
2566	A hazard is anything that may cause harm to a customer .
2567	A hazard may be :
2568	Biological ;   eg salmonella in chicken ;
2569	Physical ;   eg glass in food of any kind ;
2570	Chemical ;   eg cleaning chemicals in any kind of food .
2571	How to develop an Assured Safe Catering system
2572	The diagram below shows the stages to go through to set up an Assured Safe Catering system .
2573	This can be applied to any size of catering business .
2574	Stage 1 Planning
2575	Stage 2 Getting organised
2576	Stage 3 Draw a flow chart of the operation showing the catering steps
2577	Stage 4 For each catering step :
2578	1 )  list hazards
2579	2 )  identify controls
2580	3 )  determine critical control points
2581	4 )  monitor / record
2582	5 )  put into action
2583	6 )  check
2584	Stage 5 Repeat stage 4  ( For each catering step )
2585	Full system in action
2586	Stage 6 Full screen check
2587	Stage 7 Review
2588	Stage 1 :   Planning .
2589	You will have to do some planning and preparation before developing the system .
2590	You will also have to make sure that your stuff know about ,  and understand ,  any changes to your catering operation made because the system has been brought in .
2591	You must keep them up to date with changes as the system grows and develops .
2592	Don't try and introduce the system at once .
2593	Set it up for each step of your operation ,  and make sure it is working properly before moving on the next step .
2594	Stage 2 :   Getting organised .
2595	To set up an Assured Safe Catering system ,  you will need to decide how many people will be needed .
2596	This will depend on the size of your business ;   in a small business ,  this may be only one or two .
2597	In larger businesses ,  it may be necessary to set up a team .
2598	You should include people who can recognise hazards ,  control measures and the critical control points without too much difficulty .
2599	This means that they will need to understand each step of the catering operation as well as food hygiene principles .
2600	For a team ,  you should have a Team leader  ( this may be you )  who will have the job setting up the system and getting it running .
2601	You may also need to bring other people on to the team ,  depending on which step in the operation you are looking at .
2602	Stage 3 :   Drawing up a flow diagram .
2603	A simplified example is shown on the next page .
2604	Once the diagram has been drawn up ,  you will need to check that all the foods produced in your operation are covered .
2605	You will need to take copies of the diagram to check that it really shows what is going on in the kitchen and that steps have not been missed .
2606	Stage 4 :   Listing the hazards  ( a )  to checking the system  ( f )  .
2607	For this stage you should use the flow chart to deal with each step in the operation already identified .
2608	With the first step work through Stages 4 ( a )  to 4 ( f )  before moving on to the next step on the flow chart .
2609	Stage 4 ( a )  :   Listing the hazards .
2610	The Assured Safe Catering Team need to be able to recognise a hazard or get help from someone else who is able to do so .
2611	Remember :   A Hazard is anything that may cause harm to a customer .
2612	Stage 4 ( b )  :   Identify the control measures .
2613	List the things you need to do to remove the identified hazards or reduce them to safe levels .
2614	Some hazards may be controlled as a larger stage of the catering operation .
2615	You must be able to carry out the control measures in the kitchen where they are to be operated ,  otherwise you may not be able to use them .
2616	Stage 4 ( c )  :   Critical control points
2617	A critical control point is the step in the preparation of the food which has to be carried out correctly to make sure that a hazard is removed or reduced to a safe level .
2618	You should control the hazards shown in the Critical Control points Chart .
2619	You will need to identify the Critical Control Points that apply to your operation .
2620	There may be other Critical Control Points in your operation that are not shown in the chart .
2621	Stage 4 ( d )  :   Decide how to check and if necessary record that the controls have been applied .
2622	Checking :   Keep the methods you use to check as simple as possible ,  e.g.
2623	On delivery ,  check what the food looks like ,  its packaging ,  and the best before or use by dates ;
2624	Check that all equipment ,  eg knives and chopping boards ,  is cleaned before it is used .
2625	Recording :   Where possible ,  and where it will be useful ,  keep records to check that the food safety controls are adequate and that they work .
2626	Records will also give useful information if there is a query from a environmental health officer or a customer .
2627	Stage 4 ( e )  :   Putting the system into action
2628	You will need to prepare any necessary record sheets .
2629	You may need to produce instructions for controls and checking procedures for staff to refer to .
2630	Instructions should say :
2631	What is to be done ;
2632	How it is to be done ;
2633	When it is to be done ;
2634	Where it is to be done ;
2635	Who is to do it .
2636	Make sure all staff know and understand what they have to do so that the system works properly .
2637	Stage 4 ( f )  :   Checking the system
2638	Once you have the system in place for the first step of the operation ,  check it through to make sure that :
2639	It is running as you planned it to run ;
2640	The checking of the critical control points is satisfactory .
2641	Stage 5 :   Repeat stage 4 for each step of the operation
2642	You may now move on to the stage of the operation as shown on the flow chart .
2643	You should carry out the same procedures from 4 ( a )  to 4 ( f )  for this step in the operation .
2644	Stage 6 :   Full system check
2645	Once the system has been set up for all the steps on the flow chart ,  you will need to check that the whole system is working as you intend it to .
2646	This means making sure that the critical points you identified are :
2647	Being applied correctly ;
2648	Being checked as often as necessary ;
2649	Accompanied by adequate instructions .
2650	Stage 7 :   Full system review
2651	After the system has been developed and is running you may make changes to the way you carry out your business ,  or to your premises ;   and there may be staff changes that affect the Assured Safe Catering system .
2652	If this happens you will need to look at the whole system to make sure that it is still working or to see if any alterations or improvements are now needed .
2653	You should also review the system fairly soon after it has been put fully in to operation to make sure that any teething problems can be tackled and put right .
2654	Reviews may be needed :
2655	When checks show that the system is not working correctly ;
2656	When there are significant changes to the types of food being served ,  the layout or design of your premises ,  changes in the way you buy or prepare the food ,  or ;
2657	From time to time to see that the system is working .
2658	Assured Safe Catering will help you ,  your business ,  and your customers .

2660	Drugs and Solvents  -  You and Your Child
2661	If you don't talk to your child about drugs ,  someone else will .
2662	Help Prevent your children using drugs
2663	Most children don't get involved with drugs and solvents .
2664	But in today's world it's inevitable that your children will come into contact with them at some time .
2665	Young people nowadays find out about drugs earlier than you think  -  from the media or from friends or older children .
2666	But it's much better if they learn the facts from you than from their classmates behind the bike sheds or from watching TV
2667	If you don't talk to your child about drugs ,  someone else will .
2668	Your support can help your children to cope if they come under pressure to use drugs .
2669	Simply by talking to your children ,  you can influence whether they decide to give drugs and solvents a try  -  and you can help them to stop if you do find out they are already experimenting .
2670	Why Do They Do It ?
2671	If you understand the reasons why a child can get involved with drugs and solvents ,  it's much easier for you to talk to your children about it .
2672	If you ask children and teenagers who use drugs why they do it ,  they say :
2673	to rebel or shock people
2674	so they feel they belong to a group or friends
2675	because they want to take risks
2676	because it's fun
2677	because it's the in thing to do
2678	it's part of a night out  -  maybe at a rave
2679	because it feels and looks grown - up
2680	as an escape from the pressures of living in modern society
2681	because they are bored ;
2682	because drugs are easy to get hold of .
2683	Many of these reasons for trying drugs and solvents might seem ridiculous to us .
2684	However ,  they might seem very real to our children .
2685	When you are young tomorrow doesn't exist  -  you live for today .
2686	You can help your children to see that drugs and solvents can be dangerous for their health and well - being in the future .
2687	Whose Children Get Involved with Drugs ?
2688	The simple answer can be ,  anyone's  -  all children can be tempted to use drugs ,  no matter where they come from ,  what school they go to ,  or how bright they are .
2689	There is not always an obvious explanation for it .
2690	What's important is that you can help influence your children not to start using drugs or solvents .
2691	How You Can Help Your Children ?
2692	You can and do make a difference to your children's behaviour  -  even if it's hard to believe sometimes .
2693	There are many ways for you to influence your children not to try drugs and solvents .
2694	No one can be a perfect parent ,  and not all these ideas are easy to put into practice  -  but all of them will help .
2695	Keep Talking to Each Other
2696	Everyone needs to be able to talk about and listen to other people .
2697	It's a basic human need ,  particularly for parents and children .
2698	If it stops happening ,  problems and misunderstandings creep in ,  and you can become isolated from your children .
2699	This leaves them more likely to respond to other people  -  who could be telling them anything .
2700	So keep the communication lines open .
2701	Listen
2702	Being able to listen is a key aspect of good communication ,  but it's not as easy as it might seem .
2703	Good listening means :
2704	showing you are attentive
2705	trying to understand what your child is saying to you
2706	taking time to find out about your child's views being heard ,  listen to those of your child
2707	not butting in all the time  -  don't insist on your own views being heard ,  listen to those of your child .
2708	Tell Them About You
2709	Children often find it hard to believe you were young once !
2710	Remind them that you too were faced with dilemmas and decisions  ( although this is not an excuse to drag out all those long stories beginning  " When I was your age .  .  .  "  )  .
2711	Reveal to them that you were not perfect either ,  and that you make mistakes .
2712	You might want to point out that being able to talk through problems is helpful .
2713	There's some truth in the saying  " a problem shared is a problem halved "  .
2714	Let your children know that you would like to share your problems with them rather than always expecting it to be the other way round .
2715	Let them see you are human .
2716	Put yourself in their shoes .
2717	Young people often feel that they are facing problems that nobody else in the world has ever had before .
2718	It will help you if you can show that you do appreciate what it's like for them .
2719	It's not necessarily giving them the answer  -  or boring them with your own stories from the past .
2720	It just means showing them that you are sensitive to their problems .
2721	Try looking at the world through their eyes !
2722	Be there .
2723	You can't always be available for your children .
2724	You need to work and have time to relax ,  and they need to appreciate that .
2725	It's important ,  though ,  that your children know the door is always open for them to talk to you .
2726	You could start a regular time together to talk about any problems or worries .
2727	Or ,  you could make an agreement that they can contact you at any time if they really need to .
2728	Although you can't be around all the time ,  your children want to feel you're always interested in them .
2729	Be Firm but Consistent .
2730	Firmness does not mean having to be aggressive .
2731	It means making sure your views and feelings are known and that you want your child to respect them .
2732	Be consistent as well  -  don't keeping changing your mind ,  or making threats that you don't carry out .
2733	If you are consistent ,  you can stop your children saying that you are  " being unfair "  .
2734	If they do say it ,  it won't be true !
2735	If you set your stall out ,  your children know what's on offer and what to expect .
2736	Do Things Together
2737	Spending time with your children and talking to them are important .
2738	But it's also worth planning things you can do together regularly .
2739	It doesn't have to be anything special ;   it could be a trip to the cinema ,  a visit to a football match ,  or even just watching television together .
2740	It's vital for children to have interests which give them an alternative to using drugs .
2741	Encourage these interests ,  and you will have done something very important for your child .
2742	Make Friends with Their Friends
2743	Usually a child trying drugs for the first time will do it with a group of friend .
2744	Friends can have a lot of influence on what your child does .
2745	Your child can feel under a lot of pressure to go along with the crowd .
2746	Make sure that you know and meet your children's friends  -  even if they are not the ones you would have chosen for your child .
2747	Invite them home .
2748	Let them have somewhere they can be together .
2749	That way ,  you can still have some influence over what they do .
2750	Remember Your Child Is Unique
2751	All children have strengths ,  and they all need to feel valued and good about themselves .
2752	Sometimes those strengths can be hard to find ,  but they do exist .
2753	You can help your child develop and build on them .
2754	When they feel they can achieve something ,  and that you recognise what they've done ,  it helps to build their self - esteem .
2755	In turn ,  this makes them want to do more constructive things than use drugs .
2756	Set an example
2757	Alcohol ,  tobacco and medicines are all substances which many people use .
2758	Use of any of them can cause problems ,  such as alcohol dependency .
2759	Of course ,  all these substances are quite legal ,  but the way you use them is an example to your children .
2760	It gives them signals about how you regard drugs .
2761	What Not to Say
2762	There are a few pitfalls to avoid .
2763	Don't bully your children  -  no one reacts well to bullies
2764	Don't lecture  -  remember how it felt to be lectured at ?
2765	Don't preach  -  being  " holier than thou "  does not help a child who need help !
2766	Don't try to scare your children with shock horror stories .
2767	It doesn't work  -  and to someone who uses drugs and has experienced their effects ,  it will be unbelievable .
2768	If Your Child Is Already Using Drugs
2769	If you find out your child is using drugs or solvents ,  stay calm and don't panic .
2770	Stop and think before you do anything :
2771	What can you do that will help your child most ?
2772	Have you got the facts right ?
2773	How can you keep the communication lines open ?
2774	Is their drug - taking a repeated pattern ,  or was it a one - off  " experiment "  ?
2775	If it is one - off you may need to simply to talk to them .
2776	Be firm ,  consistent and caring ,  but disapproving .
2777	Give your child some reasons for rejecting the misuse of drugs :
2778	that it's illegal and could lead to trouble with the police ;
2779	that drug taking could affect their health now and in the future .
2780	The key is to try and discover why your child has used drugs .
2781	Once you know this you can try to tackle the cause rather than the symptoms .
2782	If your child's health or behaviour shows that they are taking drugs regularly ,  you must take further action .
2783	Bear the points above in mind .
2784	Don't lose heart ,  because there is still a lot you can do .
2785	Pledge your support
2786	Your support for your child is vital whatever the circumstances .
2787	You can build your relationship with them and show that you lave and care for them .
2788	Reassure Them
2789	Reassured children find it easier to bear the pressure as they try and come to terms with what they are doing .
2790	But don't try to argue away the consequences of their actions .
2791	Show  -  and Say  -  You Care !
2792	Children need to feel valued and cared for even when they've done something that they know you will disapprove of .
2793	" I may not like what you've done ,  but I still love you "  is the message they need to hear and believe .
2794	Get Help for You and Your Child
2795	Your child may need more help than you can provide .
2796	Think about people you know who might be able to help .
2797	There are many agencies and groups who will also be willing and able to support you .
2798	There is more information about these at the end of this leaflet .
2799	Look after yourself as well .
2800	You will need support if you are to be able to give the best you can to your child .
2801	Ask for help from family and friends ,  and professionals if necessary .
2802	Look for Gradual Change
2803	If your child is taking drugs regularly they are not likely to stop suddenly .
2804	Any improvement may be gradual ,  with ,  perhaps ,  some slip ups on the way .
2805	So you will need to be realistic .
2806	It's not your fault !
2807	Young people don't always take drugs because they have deep personal problems or to show how they reject your way of life .
2808	It is usually a passing phase .
2809	Repeated drug taking can have serious results .
2810	But it's your job to help your child deal with the problem  -  not to try to put the blame for it on yourself or others .
2811	How Do You Know If Your Child Is Using Drugs ?
2812	It's not easy to tell ,  particularly when a child first takes drugs or only takes them occasionally .
2813	Many of the signs are like those of growing up .
2814	Be sure of your facts before you do anything .
2815	It's important not to jump to conclusions if you notice any of the following things :
2816	sudden changes of mood from happy and alert to sullen and moody ;
2817	unusual irritability or aggression ;
2818	loss of appetite ;
2819	loss of interest in hobbies ,  sport ,  schoolwork or friends ;
2820	bouts of drowsiness or sleepiness ;
2821	increased evidence of telling lies or furtive behaviour ;
2822	unexplained loss of money or belongings from the home ;
2823	unusual smells ,  stains or marks on the body or clothes ,  or around the house ;
2824	unusual powders ,  tablets ,  capsules ,  scorched tinfoil or  ( more rarely nowadays )  needles or syringes .
2825	What about the Law ?
2826	Most parents are aware that their sons or daughters might be fines or imprisoned for possessing or supplying illegal drugs .
2827	( Using solvents is not illegal  -  however ,  there are offences related to selling them to minors ,  )
2828	But it is possible to break the law ,  even without touching drugs .
2829	Just allowing anyone on your  " premises "  to produce or to supply illegal drugs to another person is an offence .
2830	So if you know that your child is sharing illegal drugs with a friend in your house ,  but do nothing to stop it ,  you are committing an offence .
2831	If You Find Drugs .
2832	If you find what you think is an illegal drug ,  you have a legal duty either to hand it to the police or destroy it to prevent another person committing an offence with the drug .
2833	Do You Have to Tell the Police ?
2834	You do not have to tell the police if you suspect your children  ( or anyone else )  are taking or supplying illegal drugs .
2835	Where Can Parents Get Help ?

2940	How to get help in looking after someone
2941	A Carers guide to a carers assessment
2942	If you look after a relative ,  disabled child or friend and caring has a major impact in your life then a carer's assessment could help you .
2943	1 .  You are a  " carer "  if you look after a relative ,  friend or disabled child who needs support to live at home .
2944	Your local council Social Services Department may be able to help to make things easier for you .
2945	2 .  They can provide services to the person you care for .
2946	They can also provide services for you .
2947	3 .  To work out what services would be helpful in your situation ,  social services need to discuss
2948	The help the person you care for needs
2949	The help you are giving at the moment
2950	The services your council may provide .
2951	The way this is done is called an  " assessment "
2952	4 .  You as a carer may be involved in several ways :
2953	If you care for a disabled child your needs will be considered as part of an assessment of needs of your child and family
2954	If you care for an adult you can have a carers assessment to discuss the help that you need .
2955	This can happen even if the person you care for refuses help .
2956	You should also be able to contribute to the discussion of the needs of the person you care for  ( their Community Care assessment )  .
2957	5 .  What your assessment is for
2958	Your carer's assessment is your opportunity to tell social services about the things that could make caring easier for you .
2959	Some things you may want to think about :
2960	Do you get enough sleep ?
2961	Is your health affected in other ways ?
2962	Are you able to get out and about ?
2963	Do you get any time for yourself ?
2964	Are your other relationships affected ?
2965	Do you want information about benefits ?
2966	Are you worried you may have to give up work ?
2967	Is the person you care for getting enough help ?
2968	6 .  What sort of services might help you :
2969	services that give you a break
2970	emotional support from other carers or people who understand
2971	help with household tasks
2972	help with caring tasks during the day / night
2973	benefits advice
2974	activities for the person you care for
2975	However ,  all carers are individuals and your local council may provide any service to you that they think will help you care or help you maintain your wellbeing .
2976	So you may have some ideas of your own about services that would help you that you want to talk through with social services .
2977	Other services that you might want to discuss with them are those that may help the person you look after .
2978	Other things you may want social services to tell you about :
2979	Local or national support organisations you could contact
2980	Other help you could get
2981	Any charges for services
2982	What to do if you wish to complain
2983	Contacting social services to ask for an assessment .
2984	The telephone number of your local council social services department will be found in your local telephone directory under local authority and then community information ,  or speak to your own GP .

3038	Choosing Residential and Nursing Home Care
3039	There have been changes since April 1993 in the financial management of social care .
3040	The social security department used to pay for nursing in residential homes but now this comes under the department of social services of the city council ,  which is responsible for nursing and all arrangements for nursing .
3041	Some facilities they will provide themselves and others they will fulfil it through private agencies or organisations ,  or they will purchase these facilities .
3042	They offer the most choices for the facilities and for the people .
3043	The main object of this change is to ensure that all possible help reaches those who actually need it .
3044	And people will get the facilitiesa and services they want .
3045	If you need financial support for a nursing or residential home then contact the department of social services .
3046	After proper investigation they will decide whetheryou are in need of a residential home or nursing home ,  if you cannot live in your own home any more .
3047	They can better suggest to you social services or a district nurse or various facilities .
3048	Eligibility for nursing and residential homes
3049	To be eligible for a residential home you must need continous care and nursing which runs continously or regularly or at regular intervals .
3050	Choosing a home
3051	The city council has made an accepted list .
3052	On this list all homes must follow the following rules :
3053	they must be registered under the residential homes act 1983
3054	they must be financially stable
3055	there must be clear health and safety guidelines
3056	they fulfil all the agreements and requirements set by the city council
3057	It may be that you get an appropriate home but it is not necessary to select one of them .
3058	If the home is not on the accepted list
3059	You may go to one of those homes that are not listed on this accepted list .
3060	These places must follow the guidelines imposed by the city council and it must be suitable for your needs .
3061	These homes are always ready to follow the rules of the city council .
3062	Generally the city council pays for these facilities if not expensive ,  then others ,  then the following
3063	It is in the United Kingdom .
3064	How much you have to pay
3065	If you are selected for care in a nursing home or residential home you will have to go through a financial assessment .
3066	If your savings are more than   Â£8000 pound ,  you are expected to pay the fee .
3067	If your savings are from   Â£3000 to   Â£8000 then you are expected to pay a part of the fee ,  although there will be relaxation in some special cases .
3068	If you have savings of less than   Â£3000 and you don't have any other assets or property then you are probably eligible for some allowances .
3069	The amount will be directly paid off your nursing .
3070	You will be eligible to keep some amount for your personal expenses  ( personal allowences payment )  which is now   Â£12 . 65 .
3071	If you choose a nursing home or residential home which is more expensive in the opinion of department of social services ,  you must assure them the extra payment or give a guarantee that you or your friend or your family will pay the payment above than expectation of the department of social services .
3072	Living in residential care for a short period
3073	A residential home or nursing home may be temporarily selected for nursing .
3074	for example if your carers are in need of some rest due to illness or an accident .
3075	The city council take some charges for these services but you may ask for extra allownces for this nursing .
3076	Contact your local services office to get the more details about residential and nursing homes .
3077	Their addresses and phone numbers are listed on the next page .
3078	A better deal for tenants
3079	Your New Right to Repair
3080	Your Right to Repair
3081	As part of the Citizen's Charter scheme ,  a new Right to Repair scheme was introduced for council tenants from 1 April 1994 .
3082	The new Right to Repair is a scheme for council tenants .  It will make sure that certain small urgent repairs which might affect your health ,  safety or security ,  are done quickly and easily .
3083	Councils will be told by law to carry out these repairs within a certain time .
3084	If the council doesn't do your repair in time ,  you can tell it to get another contractor instead .
3085	If the second contractor doesn't do the repair in time ,  the council will pay you compensation .
3086	The council will tell you what repairs come under the new scheme and how long it has to carry them out .
3087	Repair times vary depending on the type of repair .
3088	For example ,  if your toilet isn't flushing ,  the council usually has one working day to come and repair it .  It has three working days to mend a loose bannister rail and seven working days to mend a broken extractor fan in your bathroom or kitchen .
3089	What repairs can you get done ?
3090	You can get certain small urgent repairs done  ( up to the value of   Â£250 )  if they are likely to affect your health ,  safety or security .
3091	These are called qualifying repairs .
3092	Qualifying repairs include :
3093	unsafe power or lighting sockets or electrical fittings ;
3094	blocked flue to open fire or boiler ;
3095	leaking roof ;
3096	toilets which don't flush ;
3097	blocked sink ,  bath or basin ;
3098	leaking from a water or heating pipe ,  tank or cistern ;
3099	loose or broken bannisters or handrails .
3100	Your council will have a full list of repairs which come under the scheme .  It will be able to tell you if a repair you need is included in the scheme and how long it has to get the repair done .
3101	The council will also be able to tell you how it deals with repairs which aren't covered under this scheme .
3102	How can you get your repairs done ?
3103	You should tell the council what repairs need to be done .
3104	The council may need to send someone to your home to check the problem first .
3105	If the repair comes under the Right to Repair scheme ,  the council will tell a contractor to do it in the set time .  The council will also send you a copy of the repair notice it sends to the contractor .
3106	The notice will show you :
3107	the name ,  address and telephone number of the contractor who will do the repair ;
3108	the arrangements made for the contractor to do the repair  ( the date and time )  ;
3109	what the repair is ;  and
3110	when the repair should be done by .
3111	You must let the council know when someone can be at home to let the contractor in .
3112	How long has the council got to carry out these repairs ?
3113	This depends on the type of repair you need ,  but the council can always tell you how long it should take .
3114	Qualifying repair times are set by law  -  not the council .
3115	What happens if the first contractor doesn't do your repair in time ?
3116	If the first contractor doesn't do your repair in time ,  you should phone the council and tell them to get a second contractor to carry out the work .
3117	Unless there is a good reason why the work hasn't been done ,  the council will get a second contractor .
3118	You will get a copy of the second repair notice  -  which the council sends to the second contractor .
3119	The second contractor then has the same amount of time to do the repair as the first one had .
3120	Compensation
3121	If the second contractor doesn't do your repair in time ,  you will get   Â£10 in compensation .
3122	For every extra day you wait ,  you will get another   Â£2 .
3123	The most compensation you can get for any one job is   Â£50 .
3124	The council will pay your compensation  -  unless you already owe it some money .
3125	If you do owe money to the council ,  it will take away the amount you owe from your compensation .
3126	Sometimes there may be a good reason why a repair can't be done .  For example ,  if you didn't keep your appointment to let the contractor in ,  and they therefore couldn't carry out the repair ,  the council won't have to pay you any compensation .
3127	How to find out more
3128	Contact your council's housing department .

3132	These leaflets are free and also available in Welsh ,  Bengali ,  Hindi ,  Urdu ,  Greek and Vietnamese .
3133	Victims of Crime
3134	This leaflet explains what will happen now you have reported a crime to the police .
3135	It tells you :
3136	How the crime will be investigated and what will happen if you have to go to court ;
3137	How you may be able to get compensation if you have been injured or if your property has been stolen or damaged ;
3138	How the police can help you ;
3139	What other help and advice is available .
3140	THE POLICE
3141	If you need to talk to the police about the crime ,  you should contact the officer dealing with your case or ,  where there is one ,  the crime desk .
3142	The contact details are :
3143	Police Force :
3144	Police Station :
3145	Telephone Number :
3146	Name of officer dealing with your case :
3147	Rank and Number :
3148	Crime Reference Number :
3149	Telephone number of crime desk  ( where relevant )  :
3150	Whenever you report a crime to the police ,  they make enquiries to try to solve it .
3151	Wherever possible you should :
3152	give them as much information as you can about the offence ;
3153	tell them if you are worried about your  ( or your family's )  safety so they can give you appropriate advice .
3154	If ,  for instance ,  you are worried about the suspect being granted bail ,  they will tell the Crown Prosecution Service of your concern ;
3155	tell the police if you change your address or telephone number so that they can tell you if someone has been arrested ,  charged or cautioned in connection with the offence ;
3156	tell them of any other changes :  for example ,  you may have noticed further losses or damage since you first reported the offence ,  or you may be suffering further effects from an injury caused by the crime ;
3157	tell them if the offence was made worse by racial abuse or hatred directed at you .
3158	WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ?
3159	The police will try to catch the criminal ,  but they may not always succeed .
3160	Even if they do have a suspect ,  there may not be enough evidence to charge the person or ,  if the suspect is young or mentally disordered ,  and the offence is not too serious ,  the police may decide to caution him or her instead .
3161	In some cases the suspect may be facing more serious charges for other offences and may be prosecuted for those offences instead .
3162	If the police decide to charge someone ,  the case is taken over by the Crown Prosecution Service  ( CPS )  ,  an independent authority ,  which prosecutes in the name of the Queen .
3163	They decide whether there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction .
3164	This means they must be satisfied that it is more likely than not that the person accused will be convicted of the charge .
3165	They must then consider whether a prosecution would be in the public interest .
3166	This means taking into account other factors ,  apart from the evidence ,  when deciding whether or not to prosecute .
3167	For example ,  it may not be necessary to prosecute an elderly person for shoplifting if the item stolen is of very small value .
3168	The CPS do not act directly on behalf of individual victims or represent them in criminal proceedings ,  but they do carefully consider the interests of victims when deciding where the public interest lies .
3169	THE PRESS
3170	The press can play an important role in tackling crime .
3171	For the purposes of investigating an offence ,  catching criminals or for crime prevention ,  the police may release details of a case to the press .
3172	But if you are concerned about the release of case details ,  tell the police officer dealing with your case .
3173	GOING TO COURT
3174	The majority of cases that reach court are dealt with by magistrates' courts .
3175	The most serious cases have to be sent to the Crown Court .
3176	If your case goes to court and you are needed as a witness :
3177	You will be sent a copy of the leaflet 'Witness in Court' which will explain what is likely to happen .
3178	You should let the police know if there are any days when it would be difficult for you to attend court .
3179	If possible ,  these dates will then be avoided .
3180	But there may be times when the case has to go ahead even though this may not be convenient for individual witnesses .
3181	If you are called to give evidence and are unable to give it in English ,  arrangements will be made to provide an interpreter .
3182	If you are not needed as a witness ,  the police will try to tell you about hearing dates .
3183	There could be several such dates if ,  for example ,  cases are delayed or postponed .
3184	They will also try to tell you about the result of the case .
3185	COMPENSATION
3186	If you have been injured or your property has been damaged or stolen as a result of a crime ,  compensation may be available in some cases .
3187	If you think you may qualify :
3188	Write Down
3189	Any extra expenses that you have had as a result of the offence ,  for example medical expenses or the cost of repairing or replacing your property .
3190	Any loss of earnings you have suffered .
3191	Any income you have received as a result of the offence  ( for example Social Security benefits )  .
3192	Keep
3193	Any receipts ,  estimates or other documents about any of these things .
3194	Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme
3195	If you have been injured because of a crime of violence you can apply for a payment under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme .
3196	The responsibility for making a claim is yours .
3197	It does not matter whether the offender has been caught ,  but there are other rules which determine whether or not you receive any money .
3198	You can find out more from the leaflet 'Victims of Crimes of Violence ,  a guide to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme' .
3199	You can get this from the police ,  from Victim Support Schemes ,  your Citizens Advice Bureau or from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority ,  Tay House ,  300 Bath Street ,  Glasgow ,  G2 4JR  ( Telephone 0800 358 3601 )  .
3200	Compensation from the Offender
3201	If someone is convicted ,  the criminal court may order the offender to pay you compensation for any injury ,  loss or damage which you have suffered because of the offence .
3202	Unlike a claim under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme  ( see previous section )  you cannot apply for a compensation order yourself .
3203	It is therefore important that you tell the police if you would like to receive compensation .
3204	They will give you a form on which you should give accurate details of your losses .
3205	This should be supported by documentary evidence  ( e.g.  receipts )  where possible .
3206	The police will then pass this information to the Crown Prosecution Service who will make sure that the court knows about it .
3207	You can be compensated for personal injury ;  losses because of theft of ,  or damage to ,  property ;  losses because of fraud ;  loss of earnings while off work ;  medical expenses ;  travelling expenses ;  pain and suffering ;  loss ,  damage or injury caused to or by a stolen vehicle .
3208	The dependants of a victim who has died  ( other than as the result of a road traffic incident )  may also receive compensation  ( for example ,  through the courts or from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme  -  see previous section )  .
3209	The Role of the Court
3210	The court has to consider compensation in every appropriate case and decide whether to order an offender to pay compensation and ,  if so ,  how much .
3211	The court must take account of the offender's circumstances and ability to pay .
3212	So if the court does decide to make an order ,  it may not be for the full amount of your loss .
3213	If the court decides to make an order against the offender ,  he or she will be required to pay the money to the court ,  which will pass it on to you .
3214	If the offender has enough money ,  the compensation will normally be paid in a lump sum .
3215	In most cases ,  however ,  the court will allow time for the offender to pay ,  or may allow the offender to pay by instalments .
3216	It is the job of the court to make sure that the offender pays the compensation .
3217	So if you have any questions about the compensation order or the way it will be paid to you ,  you should contact the clerk of the court .
3218	Do not contact the offender direct .
3219	Civil Proceedings
3220	Whether or not the offender is convicted in the criminal courts ,  you can sue him or her for damages in a civil court .
3221	You can find out more about this at your Citizens Advice Bureau or by asking a solicitor .
3222	Motor Insurers' Bureau
3223	If you suffer injury ,  loss or damage to property as a result of a road traffic incident involving a motor vehicle ,  compensation will normally be payable under insurance arrangements .
3224	Where the offender is uninsured ,  compensation for personal injury and damage to property may be available from the Motor Insurers' Bureau .
3225	Where the offender has not been traced ,  compensation for personal injury only may be available .
3226	To claim ,  you should contact the Motor Insurers' Bureau at 152 Silbury Boulevard ,  Central Milton Keynes ,  MK9 1NG .
3227	( Telephone :  01908 830001 )  .
3228	You can get further advice from the leaflet 'Victims of Uninsured and Untraced Drivers' which is available from the Department of Transport ,  Local Government and the Regions ,  Road Safety Division ,  Zone 2 / 14 ,  Great Minster House ,  76 Marsham Street ,  London SW1P 4DR .
3229	If you should succeed in getting compensation in two or more ways ,  for example from a criminal court and through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme or the Motor Insurers' Bureau ,  the award may be reduced to avoid double payment .
3230	You can't get compensation twice for the same thing from public funds .
3231	CHECK LIST FOR ACTION
3232	If you report a crime to the police you can expect :
3233	the police to investigate the crime ;
3234	to be contacted by Victim Support ,  unlessyou ask the police not to pass on your details1 ;
3235	; to be told by the police if someone is charged with ,  or cautioned for ,  the offence ;
3236	to be told  ( if you ask to be )  by the police or the Crown Prosecution Service if the charge is later dropped or altered ;
3237	if you are needed as a witness ,  to be given the 'Witness in Court' leaflet ,  told the date of the trial ,  and offered support by the Witness Service ;
3238	if the case goes to court ,  consideration to be given to making a compensation order in your favour ;
3239	to be told  ( if you ask to be )  the result of the court case ;  in the more serious cases ,
3240	to be given advice about applying for compensation for personal injury from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority ;  and
3241	to be given crime prevention advice by the police if you ask for it .
3242	To help make this possible ,  you should report the crime to the police promptly ;
3243	give the police full details of your injury or loss ;
3244	tell the police if you want compensation ;
3245	tell the police if you fear for your  ( or your family's )  safety ;
3246	tell the police if you do not want the press to be informed ;
3247	tell the police if you do not want your name and contact details passed to Victim Support ;
3248	tell the police of any change of address while the case remains unresolved ;  and contact Victim Support direct if you want to .
3249	PROTECTING YOURSELF AGAINST CRIME
3250	Unfortunately ,  some people who have been the victim of crime are more vulnerable ,  in the short term ,  to further crime .
3251	Whatever the circumstances which led to you becoming a victim of crime ,  it may be possible to take steps now to help reduce the risk of it happening again .
3252	The police can offer you free crime prevention advice ,  if you ask them .
3253	You may also find useful the Home Office crime prevention guide 'Your Practical Guide to Crime Prevention' .
3254	It gives details of simple precautions that you can take to protect yourself ,  your family and your property .
3255	Copies are available from your local police station .
3256	If there is a local Neighbourhood Watch Scheme ,  you may want to join it .
3257	If there is no scheme in your area ,  you might want to talk to your local crime prevention officer about starting one  -  there may be other people in your area who would be interested .
3258	PROTECTION FROM HARASSMENT
3259	The Protection From Harassment Act 1997 made it a criminal offence to make another person fear that violence will be used against them .
3260	It also made it an offence to cause harassment to somebody ,  for example ,  by 'stalking' .
3261	Those who commit the more serious offence of making someone fear violence can receive a fine and / or up to five years imprisonment .
3262	Those who cause harassment can receive a fine and / or up to six years imprisonment .
3263	If you have suffered harassment or fear of violence and the offender has been caught and convicted ,  the criminal court can make a restraining order against the offender to stop the threats or harassment continuing .
3264	If the offender is convicted of breaching the restraining order he or she faces a penalty of up to five years in prison .
3265	You can also seek an injunction from a civil court to put a stop to harassment .
3266	Breach of an injunction is an arrestable criminal offence ,  which carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and / or an unlimited fine .
3267	PROTECTION AGAINST ANTI - SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
3268	If someone's anti - social behaviour has been causing you harassment ,  alarm or distress ,  you can ask the police or local authority to apply to the magistrates' court for an Anti - Social Behaviour Order to stop this happening .
3269	You may not need to appear or be identified in court ,  because the court can ask to hear the evidence of a professional witness .
3270	This means that someone from the police or local authority can come out to see the behaviour for him or herself and give evidence on your behalf .
3271	The magistrates will decide if the grounds for an Order have been satisfied .
3272	An Anti - Social Behaviour Order lasts at least two years .
3273	An offender who disobeys an Order can face a penalty of up to five years imprisonment .
3274	PROTECTION AGAINST SEX OFFENDERS
3275	If the behaviour of a known sex offender is causing concern in your community ,  the police can apply to the magistrates' court for a Sex Offender Order .
3276	This type of Order protects the public by prohibiting the defendant from doing specific things  ( e.g. lingering outside a school or in a playground )  .
3277	It lasts for at least five years .
3278	An offender who breaches the Order can face a penalty of up to five years imprisonment .
3279	REMEMBER
3280	If you are not sure about anything mentioned in this leaflet ,  ask your local police for advice .
3281	Victim Support are also willing to help whenever they can .
3282	HELP FROM VICTIM SUPPORT SCHEMES
3283	You may be feeling shocked ,  sad ,  distressed ,  or angry following the crime you have just reported .
3284	These feelings are common .
3285	Victim Support volunteers are specially trained to help you through this experience and to provide you with practical help and information .
3286	The police will normally tell Victim Support about all cases of burglary ,  theft ,  criminal damage ,  arson ,  assault  ( other than domestic violence )  ,  and racial harassment .
3287	If you do not want your name passed on as a victim of crime ,  tell the police officer dealing with your case .
3288	If you have suffered a sexual crime or domestic violence ,  you will be specifically asked if you wish to be referred to Victim Support .
3289	For any type of crime ,  you can also contact them yourself at a later date if you prefer .
3290	Because resources are limited ,  victims whose cars are stolen or vandalised will not normally be referred to Victim Support .
3291	If you need help ,  tell the police officer in your case or contact Victim Support direct .

3347	If you've had anything to do with the Social Services we hope that you've been satisfied with the service you received .
3348	But we know we're not perfect ,  and if you're not happy with what Social Services has done ,  you've got the right to complain about it .
3349	All kinds of things can go wrong .
3350	You could have felt a member of staff was rude to you .
3351	Or you might have been refused a service you feel you are entitled to .
3352	Obviously we do our best to avoid such problems .
3353	But where they do crop up ,  we want to know about them .
3354	And ,  above all ,  the City Council believes that you must have the right to complain ,  and to have your complaint investigated fully ,  fairly and impartially .
3355	In most cases ,  your complaint can probably be handled by the member of staff you've been dealing with .

3357	How does it work ?
3358	You make your complaint direct to the Complaints Receiving Officer ,  who is also a senior member of staff in the Social Services .
3359	So ,  if you want to complain you just write to :   Complaints Receiving Officer Social Services Directorate ,  26 Hatton Garden Liverpool L3 2AW .
3360	Or phone Peter Dowd or Denise Tipping direct on 225 3791 .
3361	Your complaint will then be dealt with :
3362	Quickly  -  -  -  there will be no undue delays .
3363	Fairly -  -  - therewill be no discrimination on grounds of sex ,  race ,  religion or sexual orientation .
3364	Confidentially  -  -  -  the minimum number of people will know about it .
3365	Impartially  -  -  -  the investigation will not be carried out by anyone directly involved .
3366	Any meetings will be arranged at a time to suit you ,  and if necessary you will be given help with transport .
3367	You will also be able to have documents and letters typed or brailled .
3368	If you want to be accompanied  -  by a friend or advocate then you can .

3373	The above rules and rights apply to the review too .
3374	If you're not happy even after a review you may be able to take your complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman or to the courts .
3375	A solicitor or the Citizens Advice Bureau will advise you on this .
3376	We hope this procedure is clear .
3377	If not ,  phone the Complaints Officer for further help ,  if necessary ,  leave a message and we'll get back to you .
3378	Remember ,  the phone number is 225 - 3791 .
3379	Making the Connections :  Transport and Social Exclusion
3380	Summary
3381	The problem and why it matters
3382	1 .  Poor transport contributes to social exclusion in two ways .
3383	First ,  it restricts access to activities that enhance people's life chances ,  such as work ,  learning ,  health care ,  food shopping ,  and other key activities .
3384	2 .  Second ,  deprived communities suffer disproportionately from pedestrian deaths ,  pollution and the isolation which can result from living near busy roads .
3385	3 .  Poor transport is just one of a number of contributors to social exclusion .
3386	Many people experiencing social exclusion will not suffer from poor transport .
3387	However ,  poor transport can be an important factor in restricting access to opportunity .
3388	It can therefore undermine key government objectives on welfare to work ,  raising educational achievement and narrowing health inequalities ,  and has costs for individuals ,  businesses ,  communities and the state .
3389	Work
3390	4 .  Transport can be a significant barrier to accessing work :
3391	Two out of five jobseekers say lack of transport is a barrier to getting a job .
3392	One in four jobseekers say that the cost of transport is a problem getting to interviews .
3393	One in four young people have not applied for a particular job in the last 12 months because of transport problems .
3394	One in 10 people in low - income areas have turned down a job in the last twelve months because of transport .
3395	Young people with driving licences are twice as likely to get jobs than those without .
3396	Learning
3397	5 .  Poor transport is linked to young people dropping out of college :
3398	Sixteen -  to 18 - year - olds spend on average   Â£370 a year on transport .
3399	Forty - seven per cent of 16 -  to 18 - year - olds experience difficulty with this cost .
3400	Six per cent of 16 -  to 24 - year - olds turn down training or further education opportunities because of problems with transport .
3401	Health
3402	6 .  For those who rely on public transport ,  getting to hospitals is particularly difficult ,  and can lead to missed health appointments :
3403	Thirty - one per cent of people without a car have difficulties travelling to their local hospital ,  compared to 17 per cent of people with a car .
3404	Seven per cent of people without cars say they have missed ,  turned down ,  or chosen not to seek medical help over the last 12 months because of transport problems ,  double the rate in the general population .
3405	Children from the lowest social class are five times more likely to die in road accidents than those from the highest social class .
3406	Sixteen per cent of people without cars find access to supermarkets hard ,  compared with six per cent of people with cars .
3407	Social ,  cultural and sporting activities
3408	7 .  Poor transport can also affect people's participation in a range of other activities ,  including seeing friends and family ,  volunteering and caring ,  religious activities ,  exercise and cultural activities .
3409	Eighteen per cent of people without a car find seeing friends and family difficult because of transport ,  compared with eight per cent for car owners .
3410	People without cars are also twice as likely to find it difficult getting to leisure centres  ( nine per cent )  and libraries  ( seven per cent )  .
3411	What stops people getting to key places ?
3412	8 .  Nearly one in three households does not have access to a car .
3413	They depend primarily on walking to get around ,  but also on buses ,  lifts from family and friends and taxis .
3414	Cycling and rail make up a tiny fraction of their journeys .
3415	9 .  People can face three types of barriers to accessing work ,  learning ,  health care and other key activities :
3416	Access and availability :  People cannot get to key places in a reasonable time ,  reliably and safely .
3417	This may be due to poor network coverage ,  frequency ,  and reliability of public transport or a lack of accessible facilities .
3418	Only 20 per cent of buses and 10 per cent of trains meet new accessibility regulations under the Disability Discrimination Act .
3419	In addition people living in rural areas without a car face particularly acute problems due to longer walking distances to bus stops ,  and low service frequency .
3420	Cost :  People cannot afford personal or public transport .
3421	Bus fares have risen by nearly a third in the last fifteen years .
3422	Low - income households that do have a car spend nearly a quarter of their weekly household expenditure on motoring .
3423	Travel horizons :  People are unwilling to travel long journey times or distances ,  or may lack trust in ,  or familiarity with ,  transport services .
3424	The average distance to work for people on low incomes is three miles compared with eight for the general population .
3425	Jobseekers are typically not prepared to travel more than thirty minutes to a job .
3426	10 .  A large minority are therefore stuck in a vicious cycle .
3427	They experience poor transport as a consequence of social exclusion :  they cannot afford the costs of motoring or public transport fares ,  or they cannot drive because of age or disability .
3428	In deep rural areas ,  car ownership may be critical to access to basic services due to the absence of public transport .
3429	Causes
3430	11 .  Over the past fifty years ,  the need to travel has become greater and more complex as society became organised around the car .
3431	People travel 42 per cent further than in 1975 .
3432	12 .  Rising car use has allowed most people to keep pace with the need to travel ,  but for people reliant on walking and public transport ,  there is an increasing mismatch between where they need to go and whether they can get there .
3433	13 .  Past policies have contributed to the problem .
3434	Policies encouraged greater car use and failed to arrest the decline of walking and buses  -  the two most important modes of transport for people on low incomes without cars .
3435	Transport policy focused on predicting and providing for traffic growth rather than managing demand .
3436	Tax and spending decisions and bus deregulation allowed bus fares to rise much faster than motoring costs .
3437	14 .  Planning policies enabled more dispersed patterns of development ,  such as out - of - town shopping ,  leisure and office developments .
3438	These have produced more scattered destinations and lower density housing ,  both of which have undermined the viability of buses ,  cycling and walking .
3439	While bus privatisation delivered some benefits ,  it ended the ability of local authorities to set bus fares ,  thereby preventing them from rising faster than motoring costs .
3440	Privatisation also created a less stable bus network subject to many small route changes and inhibited integrated ticketing policies .
3441	What can be done ?
3442	15 .  Chapter 4 describes a number of policy approaches and innovative schemes from the UK and overseas which offer the hope of real improvement .
3443	There are policy lessons to be learned relating to :
3444	Objectives and target setting :  Copenhagen has targets to reduce public transport journey times by 10 to 15 per cent ;  ensure walking distances to bus stops are no more than 400 metres ;  and ensure journeys outside the city centre are no more than 15 minutes longer than by car .
3445	Planning integration :  in many European countries there is a regional transport company which controls fare levels ,  network coverage and marketing and promotion across all modes of transport including trams ,  buses ,  car clubs ,  walking and cycling .
3446	Funding and performance management :  in many other EU countries ,  bus services receive up to 70 per cent of their running costs in subsidy ,  compared with 32 per cent in this country .
3447	In Helsinborg ,  Sweden ,  and in Copenhagen ,  bus funding is linked to performance measures and a customer survey of 25 , 000 passengers .
3448	16 .  Practical examples of what can be done include :
3449	Improving access and availability :  through a wider network of bus routes that 'orbit' a popular destination  ( rather than radial routes )  supported by feeder services that operate on a demand responsive basis into interchanges or specific employment locations ;  development and enforcement of bus priority measures ;  car clubs ;  and tackling crime and fear of crime walking to ,  waiting for ,  or travelling on public transport .
3450	Tackling the cost barriers :  through travel vouchers which allow passengers to use a subsidy on different modes of transport ;  subsidised vehicle loans or hire ;  paying for driving lessons conditional on participation in work ;  pay - as - you drive vehicle insurance .
3451	Widening Travel horizons :  through travel advice ,  personal travel plans ,  and better travel information .
3452	Reducing the need to travel :  through more proactive land - use planning policies ,  which promote appropriate developments in suitable places .
3453	This includes focusing shops ,  leisure facilities and offices in town centres and encouraging more efficient use of land .
3454	It also covers complementary policies which encourage outreach ,  home and virtual delivery of services .
3455	Reducing the disproportionate impact of traffic on deprived areas through targeted traffic calming measures and 20 - mph zones .
3456	What are the barriers to success ?
3457	Current policy
3458	17 .  A range of improvements have been introduced in recent years .
3459	These include :  long term investment through local transport plans ,  bus priority measures through Quality Partnerships ,  urban and rural bus challenges ,  improved accessibility following the Disability Discrimination Act ,  and emerging developments in Transport Direct ,  a new nation - wide multi - modal travel enquiry and booking service .
3460	DVLR policy guidance has also placed increased emphasis on measures to improve accessibility and promote social inclusion .
3461	18 .  However ,  there are a number of critical barriers to progress including :
3462	Social costs have not been given due weight in transport policy :
3463	The cost of poor access to work ,  learning and health care falls to a range of departments .
3464	Local transport targets are focused on reducing congestion and increasing bus use ,  not ensuring that people can access work ,  learning and health care .
3465	Nor do they target programmes to ensure some communities do not suffer disproportionately from the impact of traffic through pollution and child pedestrian accidents .
3466	Local transport planning :  Local authorities do not routinely assess whether people can get to work ,  learning ,  health care or other activities in a reasonable time or cost .
3467	Spending is not tied to outcomes such as improved journey times ,  accessible vehicles ,  punctuality or customer satisfaction .
3468	In rural areas ,  pockets of deprivation can be hidden by ward - level statistics .
3469	Revenue funding level :  Around   Â£1 billion is spent on revenue support for buses through concessionary fares ,  fuel duty rebate  ( FDR )  and subsidising unprofitable services .
3470	Spending has fallen by nearly a third since 1985 ,  while spending on subsidising unprofitable routes has fallen by almost two - thirds .
3471	This reflects falling operating costs during this period .
3472	However ,  tender costs are now rising sharply due to driver shortages and commercial operators withdrawing routes .
3473	Local authorities are struggling to maintain existing services ,  rather than trying to adapt services to more dispersed land use patterns and more flexible working hours .
3474	Since 1997 ,  Urban and Rural Bus Challenges have provided additional finance to address these problems .
3475	Funding equity :  Current transport spending is regressive .
3476	The majority of transport spending benefits people on higher incomes because they are more likely to use rail and travel longer distances .
3477	It is estimated that those in the lowest income quintile will gain 12 per cent of total spending in the 10 Year Transport Plan ,  while the highest quintile would gain 38 per cent .
3478	Fragmented funding :  while   Â£1 billion is spent by DTLR on bus revenue support ,  a further   Â£900 million is spent on school ,  patient and social services transport by several different Government departments .
3479	Funding sustainability :  funding is often available to local authorities and voluntary sector groups for innovative new transport schemes ,  but they often have great difficulty finding money to sustain the service ,  even when they are successful .
3480	Regulatory barriers :  Some potential solutions ,  including demand responsive transport ,  flexibly routed buses ,  wider use of community transport ,  integrated ticketing ,  Quality Contracts ,  and applying concessionary fares to wider client groups ,  are prevented because of regulatory barriers .
3481	Towards a more inclusive system
3482	19 .  This report sets out some initial thoughts on potential improvements .
3483	Over the next few months ,  the SEU will be working with other departments to develop these in more detail .
3484	The ideas under consideration would be subject to spending review decisions .
3485	A final report in the autumn will provide further details .
3486	20 .  To ensure the social costs of poor transport are tackled effectively ,  policy needs to give due weight to the following objectives :
3487	To improve access to work ,  learning ,  health care ,  food shops and other key activities for people experiencing or at risk of social exclusion ;  and ,
3488	To reduce the inequalities in pollution and child pedestrian accidents between deprived communities and the national average .
3489	21 .  Changes in three areas are required to achieve these objectives :
3490	a )  Mainstream transport
3491	b )  Specific transport for pupils ,  patients ,  social services clients and jobseekers
3492	c )  Reducing the need to travel
3493	a )  Mainstream transport
3494	22 .  Ideas under consideration include :
3495	Clearer accountability at a local level to improve access work ,  learning and health care ,  through accessibility and impact planning .
3496	Someone would need to be responsible for auditing whether people in each area can get to key places ,  and whether deprived communities suffer disproportionately from pollution and pedestrian deaths .
3497	Local targets could then be set to improve availability ,  affordability ,  service frequency ,  crime and fear of crime walking to ,  waiting for ,  or travelling on public transport ,  or other local problems .
3498	Better information and consultation would be needed to ensure pockets of deprivation ,  such as in rural areas ,  are addressed effectively .
3499	Flexibility to achieve these objectives ,  possibly including the removal of regulatory barriers to flexibly routed buses ,  integrated ticketing ,  the use of concessionary fares for people on low incomes ,  and reducing the notice period for the implementation of Quality Contracts .
3500	Resources that are distributed more equitably ,  are more joined up ,  better targeted ,  and linked to measurable outcomes defined under accessibility and impact planning .
3501	This should ensure that social exclusion objectives are given due weight alongside economic and environmental goals ,  including through transport appraisal mechanisms .
3502	Skills ,  expertise and knowledge :  local authorities need the skills to ensure transport services adapt to consumers' requirements ,  and a firmer evidence base on which to assess problems and develop solutions .
3503	b )  Specific transport
3504	23 .  Key changes could include :
3505	Work :  A clearer deal between people seeking work and the state .
3506	This could include ensuring people can get to interviews and jobs in a reasonable time and cost through providing transport to or from out of town locations or for shift work ,  in return for a commitment to travel reasonable distances to work .
3507	The Government announced in the 2002 Budget that   Â£5 million per annum would be made available to fund transport solutions for jobseekers in the 63 areas covered by Action Teams for Jobs .
3508	Learning :  ensuring that transport routes are more sharply focused on schools ,  colleges and training providers ;  ensuring that the cost of transport to schools and colleges does not restrict access to education .
3509	Health care :  better advice on how to get to hospital through mainstream transport ;  greater publicity for the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme ;  greater choice over the timing of hospital appointments to fit in with travel needs ;  and a better integration of support available from non - emergency patient transport ,  the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme and the Social Fund .
3510	c )  Reducing the need to travel :
3511	24 .  Transport providers should factor in the needs of people experiencing or at risk of social exclusion in terms of access to work ,  learning ,  health care and other activities .
3512	Similarly ,  planners of new facilities need to factor in considerations of accessibility by public transport and walking and cycling to these activities and services .
3513	This applies not just to opening new facilities but equally to closures of existing facilities ,  including schools ,  hospitals ,  health centres ,  GP practices and other community facilities .
